Using statistical software if needed, answer the following two questions:\n\n## Q1\n\nEnter the probability that $X$ X is no more  than one, \n$P(X≤1)$ :\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(pnorm(1, mean=1, sd=2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Q2\n\n\nEnter the probability that $X$ X is no less than minus two, \n$P(X\\ge-2)$ :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(1-pnorm(-2, mean=1, sd=2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.9331928\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n$N(x)=P(Z≤x)$ denotes the probability that a standard normal random variable $Z$ is no more than $x$. \n\nConsider the probability\n\n$$\nP(a e^{bZ+c} \\ge d).\n$$ \n## Q3\n\nHere, $a,b,c,d$ are positive constants and $e^x$  is the exponential function.\n\nWhat is the expression for that probability in terms of function $N(x)$?\n\n\n$$\nP(a e^{bZ+c} \\ge d) = N\\left( \\frac{c- \\log(d) + \\log(a) }{b}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n## Q4\n\nConsider the function \n\n$$\nf(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(x-m)^2}.\n$$\n \nKnowing that the integral of $cf(x)$ from minus infinity to plus infinity is equal to one, what is the value of c\n\nsince the formula for the normal distribution is\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwe substitute $\\mu = m$ and $\\sigma = 1$ to get\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(x-m)^2}\n$$\n\nsince this is a distribution, the integral of $f(x)$ from minus infinity to plus infinity is equal to one.\n\nTherefore, the constant $c$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$.\n\nwhat is \n\n$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} cxf(x) dx$ equal to?\n\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} cxf(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(x-m)^2} dx\n$$\nbut this is the expected value of the normal distribution, which is equal to the mean of the distribution. Therefore, the integral is equal to $m$.\n\n\n## Q5\n\nf(t) be the solution to the ordinary differential equation\n\n$$\nf'(t) = 2 f(t)\n$$\n\nwith the boundary condition \n \n$$\nf(0) = 3\n$$\n\nthe a solution to this differential equation is of the form\n\n$$\nf(t) = e^{2t} + c\n$$\n\nsubstitute the boundary condition  $f(0) = 3$ to get the value of the constant $c$: as \n\n$$\nf(0) =  e^{2*0} + c = 1 + c = 3 \\implies c = 2\n$$\nTherefore, the exact solution to the differential equation is\n\n$$\nf(t) = e^{2t} + 2\n$$\n\nEnter the numerical value value of $f(0)$:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf <- function(t) {\n  return(exp(2*t) + 2)\n}\nf(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 9.389056\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf(0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## 6 \n\nConsider the function \n\n$$\nf(x,y) = x^2 y^3.\n$$\n\nEnter the value of its derivative with respect to $y$ at the point $(x=2, y=3)$\n \nthe derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ is\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3x^2y^2\n$$\nsubstitute $x=2$ and $y=3$ to get\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3(2)^2(3)^2 = 3*4*9 = 108\n$$\n\n## Q7\nthe second partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ and $x$ is\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 6xy^2\n$$\n\nsubstitute $x=2$ and $y=3$ to get\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 6(2)(3)^2 = 6*2*9 = 108\n$$\n\n## Q8\n\nX be a random variable that takes values 0, 1 and 2 with probabilities 1/4, 1/4 and 1/2, respectively.\n\nEnter the numerical value for the expected value of \n\n$$\nE[X]\n$$\n$$\nE[X] = 0*\\frac{1}{4} + 1*\\frac{1}{4} + 2*\\frac{1}{2} = 0 + 0.25 + 1 = 1.25\n$$\n## Q9\n\nEnter the numerical value for the variance of X $Var[X]$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nVar[X]\n  & = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \\\\ \n  & = 0^2*\\frac{1}{4} + 1^2*\\frac{1}{4} + 2^2*\\frac{1}{2} - (1.25)^2 \\\\\n  & = 0 + 0.25 + 2 - 1.5625 \\\\\n  & = 0.6875\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n## Q10\n\nLet \n$$\ng(x) = f(x, y(x))\n$$\nwhere $y(x)$ is a function of $x$ and $f(x,y)$ is a function of two variables. Denote the derivative of $y(x)$ with respect to $x$ by $y_x$, the derivative of $f$ with respect to the first variable, and evaluated at the point $(x, y(x))$, by $f_x$, and the derivative of $f$ with respect to the second variable, and evaluated at the point $(x, y(x))$, by $f_y$.\n\nWrite, in terms of only $y_x, f_x, f_y$, the derivative of the function $g(x) = f(x, y(x))$ with respect to $x$. Explicitly indicate multiplication with a \"*\" symbol, and write the derivatives as y_x, f_x, f_y.\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = f_x + f_y*y_x\n$$\nwhere I used the chain rule for differentiation.\n",
