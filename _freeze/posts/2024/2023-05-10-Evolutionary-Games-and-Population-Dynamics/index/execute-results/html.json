This leads to x/x = a — by (with a,b> 0). In the absence of prey, the predatory fish would have to die, which means a negative rate of growth; but this rate picks up with the density χ of prey fish, hence y/y = — c + dx (with c,d > 0). Together, this yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot x &= x(\\alpha - \\beta y) \\\\\n\\dot y &= y(\\delta x - \\gamma )\\\\\n\\text{where} & \\quad \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta > 0\n\\end{align*} \\qquad\n$$\nhere, x is the prey population (rabbits) and y is the predator population (fox).\n\nphase space diagram\n\n::: {#0dc34dc0 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom pylab import *\n\nalpha, beta, gamma, delta = 2, 1, 1.5, 1\nxvalues, yvalues = meshgrid(arange(0, 4, 0.1), arange(0, 4, 0.1))\nxdot = xvalues*(alpha - beta * yvalues)\nydot = yvalues *( delta * xvalues - gamma)\nstreamplot(xvalues, yvalues, xdot, ydot)\nshow()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=571 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
