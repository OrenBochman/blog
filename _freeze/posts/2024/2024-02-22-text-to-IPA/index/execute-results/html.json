Tense=Past\n1 read read VERB ??? Tense=Past\n\n\nanyhow the main point is that we convert text to IPA using espeak-ng\n\n```{bash}\nespeak-ng -v mb-en1 \"Hello World Thanks you very much\" --ipa\n```\n\nA second point is that we can also add user dictionary with entries for words with missing pronunciations.\n\nQ1. can we preprocess the text to discover missing pronunciations\nQ2. can we use an LLM or a web based tool to look up as many of these as possible\nQ3. can we train a transducer type transformer to convert the rest!\n\n",
