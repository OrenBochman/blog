However the growing interest seems to\n  be in ML and specialy in Multiagent reinforecement Learning (MARL).  \n- Reading the book repeatedly in many places, I began to feel that the book had two types of material \n    - the briliant presentation of interweeving ideas.\n    - lots of filler that had grown out of extended litrature reviews on subjects touching on lewis games. \n        - Much of these tended to digress from the main research questions.\n        - Almost all of these were not very interesting\n        - But a few are very interesting indeed \n        - A select few merit deeper coverage and required deeper dives to clarify many point that the author had not full digested.\n- At the time of writing some of the more interesting work on composonality and evolution of grammar had either not been done\n  \n\n- I eventually decided to go over the bibliography and extract the different items that seemed more relevant.\n- This took more time than I could spare. \n    - Some items I need to cover were book sized or chapter sized\n    - Others quickly led to event more useful publication that were not part of the books bibliography. Serveral by skryms.\n- There are a few variants of the lewis games now using different\n- I ended up classiffing the least and most relevant items. \n\nGoing through the bibliography many times \n\nand annotating the intersting and less interesting entries.\n\n# Signals Bibliography - some annotations\n\n\n\nThe following bibliographical entries are on\n\n- General and Evolutionary Game Theory:\n\n-   [@vonneumann1947] - The first book on game theory.\n-   [@Weibull1997] - A book on evolutionary game theory.\n-   [@hofbauer1998evolutionary] - Covers the mathematical theory of evolutionary games focusing on the lokta volterra model and the replicator dynamics.\n-   [@Samuelson1998Evolutionary] - Covers on evolutionary game theory in extensive forms.\n-   [@Nowak2006Evolutionary] - A book on evolutionary dynamics.\n-   **Aumann, R.
