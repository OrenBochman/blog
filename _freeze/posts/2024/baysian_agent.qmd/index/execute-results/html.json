It defines agents with different roles (Sheriff and Suspect) and types (Criminal or Civilian for the suspect). Each agent makes decisions based on its beliefs and the payoff structure defined for the game. The game tracks the actions, payoffs, and beliefs of each player and simulates multiple iterations of the game.\n\n::: {#2f828cf6 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport random\nimport mesa\nfrom mesa import Agent, Model, DataCollector\nfrom mesa.time import RandomActivation\n\nclass SheriffAgent(Agent):\n    \"\"\"Agent representing the Sheriff.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):\n        super().__init__(unique_id, model)\n        self.action = None\n    \n    def step(self):\n        # Sheriff decides based on belief about the suspect's type\n        belief_criminal = self.model.belief_criminal\n        # Simple decision rule based on belief (could be improved with a more sophisticated strategy)\n        self.action = \"Shoot\" if belief_criminal > 0.5 else \"Not\"\n\nclass SuspectAgent(Agent):\n    \"\"\"Agent representing the Suspect.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, unique_id, model, suspect_type):\n        super().__init__(unique_id, model)\n        self.suspect_type = suspect_type\n        self.action = None\n    \n    def step(self):\n        # Suspect's decision could be based on its type or a strategy considering the sheriff's action\n        # For simplicity, let's say criminals are more likely to shoot\n        if self.suspect_type == \"Criminal\":\n            self.action = \"Shoot\" if random.random() > 0.5 else \"Not\"\n        else:\n            self.action = \"Not\"  # Civilians are less likely to shoot\n\nclass SheriffsDilemma(Model):\n    \"\"\"A model for the Sheriff's Dilemma game.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, p_criminal):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.schedule = mesa.time.RandomActivation(self)\n        self.suspect_type = \"Criminal\" if random.random() < p_criminal else \"Civilian\"\n        self.belief_criminal = p_criminal  # Initial belief about suspect being a criminal\n        self.payoff = None\n        # Create agents\n        sheriff = SheriffAgent(1, self)\n        suspect = SuspectAgent(2, self, self.suspect_type)\n        self.schedule.add(sheriff)\n        self.schedule.add(suspect)\n        \n        self.datacollector = mesa.DataCollector(\n          model_reporters={\"Payoff\":\"payoff\"},\n          agent_reporters={\"Action\":\"action\"}\n            )\n            \n\n    \n    def step(self):\n        self.datacollector.collect(self)\n        self.schedule.step()\n        \n        # After both agents have taken their actions, calculate payoffs based on the table provided\n        sheriff_action = [agent for agent in self.schedule.agents if isinstance(agent, SheriffAgent)][0].action\n        suspect_action = [agent for agent in self.schedule.agents if isinstance(agent, SuspectAgent)][0].action\n        suspect_type = self.suspect_type\n\n        payoff_matrix = {\n            (\"Criminal\", \"Shoot\", \"Shoot\"): (0, 0),\n            (\"Criminal\", \"Shoot\", \"Not\"): (2, -2),\n            (\"Criminal\", \"Not\", \"Shoot\"): (-2, -1),\n            (\"Criminal\", \"Not\", \"Not\"): (-1, 1),\n            (\"Civilian\", \"Shoot\", \"Shoot\"): (-3, -1),\n            (\"Civilian\", \"Shoot\", \"Not\"): (-1, -2),\n            (\"Civilian\", \"Not\", \"Shoot\"): (-2, -1),\n            (\"Civilian\", \"Not\", \"Not\"): (0, 0),\n        }\n        self.payoff = payoff_matrix[(suspect_type, suspect_action, sheriff_action)]\n        print(f\"Round results -
