00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Hi. In this lecture, we're gonna compare
and contrast the three ways we've thought

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.970
about modeling people. So remember we
talked about first people being rational,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.475
people having objective functions, and
optimizing with respect to their

4
00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:16.128
objectives. Then we talked about how
that's somewhat unrealistic. We talked

5
00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:20.127
about the behavior models, and I tend to
think of these as rationality plus, where

6
00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:23.928
we sort of assume rational behavior but
then we add in a bias, or rationality

7
00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:27.724
minus, is sort of being a little bit below
rational behavior. And then the third

8
00:00:27.724 --> 00:00:31.108
thing we did is we said well you know,
maybe we could even go simpler and we

9
00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:34.404
could just assume that people follow
rules. These could be fixed rules. They

10
00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:37.787
could be adaptive rules. And when you
write down a model, you could say here's

11
00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:41.390
the rule that people follow. Now in some
cases, the rule that people follow will be

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.862
rational. In some cases, the rule that
people follow will be behavioral. In other

13
00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:48.340
cases, the rule that people follow will
just be some rule that we made up. What

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.620
I'm going to do in this lecture is I'm
gonna ask does it matter. Does it matter

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.845
which rules we write down? Does it matter
whether you have rule based behavior,

16
00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:01.287
optimizing behavior, or behavioral models?
Well, the answer is it depends. And one of

17
00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:05.838
the reason why we model is to figure out
how much does it matter how effectively we

18
00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:09.773
model, or how accurately we model I should
say. So, let me do two examples. First,

19
00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:13.380
I'm going to talk about a market, just a
pure exchange market. And then I'm going

20
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.033
to talk about a game, called Race to the
Bottom. You're gonna see in the market, it

21
00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.505
really doesn't matter that much how we
model behavior, but in the Race to the

22
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:24.360
Bottom. You're going to see, it matters a
lot. So let's get started. So a two-sided

23
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.517
market. What is a two-sided market? Well,
a two-sided market has a group of buyers;

24
00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:32.831
and these are people who want to buy some
good. And let's suppose. Just for the sake

25
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:36.884
or argument, that these buyers in the
setting have prices between zero and $100,

26
00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:40.729
that means they're willing to pay
somewhere between zero and $100 for this

27
00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.886
good. Now in addition to the buyers, there
are some sellers and let's suppose the

28
00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:49.383
sellers are wiling to sell. For between
50, and 150 miles. So now let's think

29
00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:54.538
about, what would rationale people do. So
those people who are complete rationale,

30
00:01:54.538 --> 00:02:00.940
in this setting. How would they behave?
Well. If you're a buyer. You basically be

31
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.747
it a little bit less. Right then your true
value because you'd try and make a little

32
00:02:05.747 --> 00:02:09.703
bit of money. And if you're a seller,
you'd probably ask for a little bit more

33
00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:13.916
than your true value. And how much more or
less you ask for is gonna depend on, you

34
00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:17.976
know, what the distributions of these
buyers and sellers are. So if you're fully

35
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:21.829
informed about what other people, what
these distributions are, you're gonna

36
00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.094
shade in particular ways. Now what's gonna
happen is, let's suppose that people keep

37
00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:30.051
on calling out prices until the market
clears. Until the number of goods sold,

38
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:34.110
that people want to sell at that price is
exactly equal to the number of goods

39
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.805
bought. The way it's going to work is each
person calls out each buyer calls out a

40
00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:41.363
price their willing to buy at, each seller
calls out, a price they are willing to

41
00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:44.744
sell at, and then we pick some sort of
price in the middle so we get an even

42
00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:48.346
number of buyers and sellers. But what's
going to happen in the situation is that

43
00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:51.726
the only buyers, that are gonna have a
value of at least 50 since people are

44
00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:55.106
rational, the only buyers that are
actually gonna be, be able to buy anything

45
00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:59.043
are going to have a value of about 50. So
the relevant buyers. Are gonna have values

46
00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:03.494
in 50 to 100. So we only need to worry
about these people. So we can call these B

47
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:07.944
star. And the relevant sellers are gonna
be the only ones that advise between 50

48
00:03:07.944 --> 00:03:12.172
and 100 as well. Because the ones that
have values above 100, from 100 to 150,

49
00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:16.400
they want too much. Nobody, nobody's
willing to pay that much for their goods.

50
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.572
[inaudible], people are gonna call out
these prices, and what we're probably

51
00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:24.967
gonna get is we're probably gonna get a
price of around 75, right? Where some of

52
00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:29.484
the buyers buy, some of sellers sell, but
not all of them do. Let's suppose instead

53
00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:33.804
we assume people are biased, that they're
not super strategic in figuring out

54
00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:38.573
exactly how much to shave their bids. Well
then what people would probably do is they

55
00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:42.837
might rely on sort of focal bids. So
people would be more likely to bid like

56
00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:47.101
50, or 60 or 70 or 75. Even increments.
So, let me be more specific. So it might

57
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:51.702
be that if your rational buyer your value
is 56 that what you should do is you

58
00:03:51.702 --> 00:03:55.966
should say I'm willing to pay 53.72 cents
Right you solve some really fancy

59
00:03:55.966 --> 00:04:00.005
mathematical equation. [inaudible] That's
exactly your optimal bid. Well a

60
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:04.410
behavioral person might not do all that.
Ask. And it might say well my value's 56

61
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.731
so I'll bid 52 or I'll bid 50, 55, right.
Just some focal number. They're not going

62
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:13.214
to do all the math. Well again, if there's
just those slight deviations, you're still

63
00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:17.373
probably going to see a price of about
$75. So optimizing behavior and sort of

64
00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:21.731
slight behavioral bias is not going to be
a big difference. What about rule based

65
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:25.832
behavior? Well this has actually been
studied using a simple rule base called

66
00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:29.933
zero intelligence agents. This is ZI,
we'll abbreviate it. So zero intelligence

67
00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:33.875
agents work as follows. If you're a
bidder, what you do is you just sort of,

68
00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:38.136
if you're a buyer, what you do is just
basically say okay, I'm just going to pick

69
00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:42.759
some random amount less than my value. And
if you're a seller, you just pick some

70
00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.463
random amount more than your value. So if
you're a buyer, and your value's 40.

71
00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:52.415
Right, so if I'm the buyer who's value's
40, I might say, oh, I'm willing to buy it

72
00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:57.243
for twenty. And if I'm a seller who's
value's 60, I might say, oh I'm willing to

73
00:04:57.243 --> 00:05:02.240
sell it for 63. So what happens is, is you
just choose some random amount. What turns

74
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.258
out if you analyze the [inaudible] market
with. >> These zero intelligent traders.

75
00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:10.379
What you end up getting is something with
a price pretty close to 75 and not that

76
00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.846
different from what you'd get with
rational actors. So, in a two sided

77
00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:17.916
market, right, [inaudible] and things, you
know, we've got models in economics, we've

78
00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:22.037
got sort of supply and demand curves and
things like that where we get some price.

79
00:05:22.037 --> 00:05:26.208
It turns out the market itself has so much
influence. The institutions have so much

80
00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:30.077
influence. The behavior really doesn't
matter a great deal within some fairly

81
00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:34.097
wide range of [inaudible]. So in markets,
we don't care as much about [inaudible]

82
00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:37.859
behavior. But now in games, we do. So
let's do a specific game, it's called the

83
00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:41.958
race to the bottom game, and here's how it
works. You pick a number between zero and

84
00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.811
a hundred, the whole group, the group of
people in the room. Each person's gonna

85
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:49.763
pick a number between zero and a hundred,
whoever's closest to two thirds of the

86
00:05:49.763 --> 00:05:57.189
mean. Wins. Alright, so what do you do?
Little quiz, what do you do in this

87
00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:04.273
situation? Well. Let's, let's look. So
what does a rational person do. So if a

88
00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:09.340
rational person is gonna be in this
situation it turns out is bid zero. Why is

89
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.148
that. Well, it's a completely symmetric
game. Everybody's got the exact same

90
00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:19.540
sentence, everybody is rational, everybody
should be doing the same thing. So suppose

91
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.692
everybody was picking six. If everybody
was picking six, then the mean would be

92
00:06:24.692 --> 00:06:29.953
six. If the mean is six, two-thirds of six
is four, so if you're rational and you

93
00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:35.414
know everybody's picking six you should
pick two-thirds of six so you should pick

94
00:06:35.414 --> 00:06:40.009
four. So, but then if everybody, then
everybody should pick four. But if

95
00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.403
everybody's picking four, then you should
guess two-thirds of four, right? Which is

96
00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:49.326
8/3. [inaudible] of everybody else. If
everybody's picking 8/3 then you should

97
00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:53.383
give two-thirds of 8/3, and so on, and so
forth, and so on. Until eventually you get

98
00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:57.490
down to everybody should be bidding, 0's.
That's what rational [inaudible] would be.

99
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:04.417
What would bias behavior be? Well, if you
were sort of. Not strategic at all. I'm,

100
00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:08.737
super biased in this situation. Say, okay.
Fifteen and a number between zero and 100.

101
00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:12.531
I don't know [inaudible] thing. I'm
confused. What I'm going to do is I'm

102
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:16.398
going to guess 50. And in fact if you
watch people play this game there's a

103
00:07:16.398 --> 00:07:20.546
certain percentage of people who do guess
50. And in fact, you know, I've done this

104
00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:24.745
in my classroom a whole bunch of times and
you'll get a significant percentage of

105
00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:28.893
people who just say I'm going to guess 50.
Now, what would a behavioral rule be in

106
00:07:28.893 --> 00:07:32.682
this situation? What would a rule based
behavior be? Well, again this is the

107
00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:36.625
instance studied a lot and a rule that
people tend to study is this. They say

108
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:42.455
well, you know, people should guess 50. If
everybody guesses 50, I should guess

109
00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:49.288
two-thirds of 50, so therefore I should
guess 33. So you see a lot of people guess

110
00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:54.167
33. But then there's a lot of other people
who say "you know what everybody should

111
00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:58.625
guess, is going to guess, so if everyone's
going to guess 33, I should guess

112
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:03.442
two-thirds of 33". Which is 22 and so if
you look at. With the experiment, you see

113
00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:08.152
sum 50, sum 33, sum 22's in some. Right
two thirds of 22 is fourteen so you see,

114
00:08:08.152 --> 00:08:12.679
some people actually say this. Look,
people should guess 50 [laugh], so some

115
00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:17.390
[inaudible] should guess 50, I guess two
thirds of 50 which is 33. [inaudible]

116
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.528
Everybody should guess 33. So then I guess
two thirds of 33 which is 22. If anybody's

117
00:08:22.528 --> 00:08:27.357
gonna guess 22. So I guess two thirds of
22 which is fourteen. Now of course if we

118
00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:31.364
kept going with this we get to the
rational behavior eventually, which is

119
00:08:31.364 --> 00:08:35.535
zero. Right? And, in fact if you played
this long enough these number do creep

120
00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:39.761
down to zero, but they don't, typically
don't get there. You have to run them a

121
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:44.262
lot of times. So it's interesting here is,
the behavior we see is, this rule is sort

122
00:08:44.262 --> 00:08:49.033
of a mix of rationale. And the buyer. So
the buyer's thing is to get 50. So people

123
00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:54.070
sort of start with the base three by 50
stays in the middle. After that they start

124
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.862
sort of test responding. Never on an
adaptive rule for learning what?s the best

125
00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:03.899
response. So the best responsibility, best
responsibility ?cause its 50 is to choose

126
00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:08.752
33. And the best response ?cause choosing
33 is to choose 22 and so on. So here's

127
00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:13.789
what we see, is the rules that people use
to sort of start up with the [inaudible]

128
00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:17.936
buyers Someone rational. Let's do
something really fun here. [laugh] So

129
00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:21.674
let's suppose we have two rational people
in this game and one irrational person. So

130
00:09:21.674 --> 00:09:24.967
let's suppose you're sitting in a
[inaudible] space with three people and

131
00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:28.527
you're a rational person, let's say you've
seen this game before, you know how it

132
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:32.264
works. And you're playing with me and you
know I've seen this game before and I know

133
00:09:32.264 --> 00:09:35.735
how it works. But there's this third
person sitting in the room and this third

134
00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:39.117
person we don't know anything about. We
know that they haven't seen the game

135
00:09:39.117 --> 00:09:42.281
before and they, you know. Here are the
instructions. And we're both looking at

136
00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:45.903
him trying to figure, what is this person
going to do? Well. Let's try and analyze

137
00:09:45.903 --> 00:09:50.509
this. So suppose I'm a rational person,
and you're a rational person. So we're

138
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:54.994
gonna pick sum amount R, right? Now, the
other person, the [inaudible] person,

139
00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:59.660
you've gotta make some decision, like,
what do you we think they're gonna pick?

140
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.755
Well, suppose we both think they're gonna
pick X. Well, if they're gonna pick x, we

141
00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:10.081
have to decide how much do we pick, what
do we pick. Well, here's what has to be

142
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:15.544
true. The amount we pick r has to be two
thirds of r plus r plus x, right? Because

143
00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:20.733
it's gotta be two thirds of the sum of
everybody else's, divided by three. So

144
00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:26.333
it's gotta be two thirds of the mean, so
it's gotta be two thirds of r plus r plus

145
00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:32.614
x, divided by three. So if I multiply this
out, I'm gonna get nine r. Has got to

146
00:10:32.614 --> 00:10:45.195
equal 2xR+R+X, right. And so I'm going to
get, this ends up being 4R so I'm going to

147
00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:54.444
get 5R=2X. So R equals. 2x over five. So
what that means is we both think "oh, this

148
00:10:54.444 --> 00:10:59.597
other person is". What, I don't know.
Totally irrational, supposed to think the

149
00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:04.348
other person is gonna choose 50. We think
the other person is gonna choose 50. Then

150
00:11:04.348 --> 00:11:08.866
r equals two times 50 over five, r is
gonna equal twenty. Right, so if the other

151
00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:13.269
person chooses 50. And we both choose
twenty, the sum will be 90. Right, so the

152
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:17.730
average is 30. And so two thirds of the
mean will be twenty. So why did I give

153
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.633
this example. Just think back. If
everybody is rational, the mean is zero.

154
00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:26.026
The mean bid is zero and two-thirds of the
mean is zero and we split the money. But

155
00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:30.207
here we throw in one irrational person,
then we no longer get zero. Right? We get

156
00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:34.388
something a lot bigger than zero, because
the rational people have to take into

157
00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:38.570
account what the other person's bid is
gonna be, and so they want to make their

158
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.804
bid as a function of that, and that drives
up their bid which drives up the mean,

159
00:11:42.804 --> 00:11:46.827
which in term drives up their bid. So,
what's the lesson we take away? I think

160
00:11:46.827 --> 00:11:51.054
the simple lesson is this, that rational
behavior is a really good benchmark. But

161
00:11:51.054 --> 00:11:55.203
it's also important to included biases in
our model. Think about, are there biases

162
00:11:55.203 --> 00:11:59.198
that would be relevant. And it's also
important to think about what if we just

163
00:11:59.198 --> 00:12:03.142
write down a simple rule. And then if we
compare these three things. Rationale

164
00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:06.576
behavior, bias. Right, and then simple
rule. And we see, well, how much

165
00:12:06.576 --> 00:12:10.703
difference do we see in the outcome. If
the difference is small, then we can say

166
00:12:10.703 --> 00:12:14.621
you can look our results seem to be sort
of [inaudible] to behavior. If the

167
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:18.696
difference is big, then what you gotta do
is you gotta sit back and think. Okay

168
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:22.928
which of these three makes the most sense.
And regardless of [inaudible] modeling,

169
00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:27.055
whether it's the, just the [inaudible] of
the world. Whether it's [inaudible] to

170
00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:31.245
understand data. Right, [inaudible] the
logic right, or whether it's to. Design

171
00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:35.932
something. Strategize in some way. It's
probably really useful, to think about all

172
00:12:35.932 --> 00:12:40.267
three classes of [inaudible], in the
context that you're considering. Thank
