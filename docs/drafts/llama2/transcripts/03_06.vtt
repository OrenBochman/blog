Hi. In this lecture we're gonna talk about
bringing modules to data and when I say

2
00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:08.008
data what I mean is you know you. Pull all
sorts of numbers off the web, or maybe

3
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.159
you've got you know, in you?re, for your
business or your home you got all this

4
00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.517
data out there and how much money you've
spent each month or something like that.

5
00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:17.710
We [inaudible] how we can use models to
understand that data. And we're gonna

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.068
start simple and we're gonna build up. So
we're gonna start with something that I

7
00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:24.177
call categorical models. Now in a
categorical model what you do is you just

8
00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:27.453
sort of place all the different data in
different boxes. So for example, suppose

9
00:00:27.453 --> 00:00:30.852
you had a bunch of data on how long people
live, and you want to try to understand

10
00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:34.723
what. Allows someone to live a long and
healthy life. We might create one box of

11
00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:38.684
people who exercise and one box of people
who don't exercise and we can just, by

12
00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:42.892
looking at how much variation there is in
each of those boxes and what the means are

13
00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:47.100
in those two boxes you can figure out does
that distinction make that categorization

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.110
between exercising and not exercising,
does that actually help understand all the

15
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.407
variation in the data? After you do
categorical models we're gonna move on to

16
00:00:55.407 --> 00:00:59.955
linear models. Now why don't I give a
distinction between a linear model and a

17
00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:04.446
line. So a line is just something that we
plot, right? So we just have like, you

18
00:01:04.446 --> 00:01:08.878
know, here's the Y variable, here's the X
variable, and we draw this line. In a

19
00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:13.661
linear model what we assume is we assume
that this Y variable depends on X. Right?

20
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:18.350
And so what this is, is this, this is some
sort of relationship. So in this axis, X

21
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.157
could literally be the amount of exercise
you do, and Y could be how long you live.

22
00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:27.846
And so what you have is this line is sort
of saying that how long you live is a

23
00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:32.360
function of how much you exercise. So
you're literally thinking [inaudible] Y.

24
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.133
Is some function of X. Okay, so after we
do linear models, and I explain what they

25
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:41.727
mean. And I have a short lecture sort of
describing how we fit data to linear

26
00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:46.381
models. So if you've got a bunch of data,
and then you wanna construct a linear

27
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:51.095
model, how do we do it? Here's a simple
example. Suppose I've got a bunch of data

28
00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:55.217
here like this. And I want to ask, you
know what's the best line to go through

29
00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:59.433
that data? Well clearly this would be a
terrible line because it doesn't, it's not

30
00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:03.754
near the data. This line here that they've
done this black line looks like a pretty

31
00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:07.971
good line. It looks pretty close to the
data, so we're going to see how exactly to

32
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:11.979
draw the line and what criteria do you
use, right, to make sure you've got the

33
00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.598
best line? After we've done linear models,
we're gonna move nonlinear models. And

34
00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.877
we'll show that the techniques are
actually fairly similar. Now, what do I

35
00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:22.424
mean by nonlinear? Well, one simple way
that somebody could be nonlinear, is they

36
00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:26.248
could start out straight and then kind of
flatten out. Or, something could start out

37
00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:30.154
slow, and then get big. Or it could sorta
do both. It could start out slow, and then

38
00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:33.916
get big, and then flatten out, right? So
there's all different shapes a function

39
00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:37.581
could take. You know, John Von Neumann,
one time, said, the set of non linear

40
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:41.102
functions is like the set of non
elephants. And by that, he meant that the,

41
00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:44.960
the number of non linear functions is
enormous. So we'll talk a little bit about

42
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.384
how we could use some of the same
techniques used for linear models to

43
00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:53.203
create non linear models. Now after we do
that we're gonna conclude this, this unit

44
00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:58.337
by talking about something I call the big
coefficient. So what do I mean? Well when

45
00:02:58.337 --> 00:03:03.154
you have a linear model, right? You have
like Y equals A1, X1 plus A2, X2. So X1

46
00:03:03.154 --> 00:03:07.972
and X2 are the variables. These are the
things that determine the outcome. So

47
00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:12.852
we'll talk about for example school
quality. So X1 might be what the class

48
00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:17.776
size is. And X2 might be how good the
teacher is. And so this A1 and A2 are the

49
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:22.697
coefficients, and these coefficients tell
how important is the variable. So the

50
00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:27.555
bigger the coefficient, the more important
the variable. So when I say the big

51
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:32.287
coefficient. What I mean is making
policies or making the decision based on

52
00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:36.317
which one of these coefficients is
biggest. Now that makes a lot of sense. So

53
00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:39.432
what I'm gonna do is, I'm first going to
argue that boy, you know, better to use

54
00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:42.746
the big coefficient then to just sort of
do seat of the pants thinking. We're going

55
00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:45.780
to see why that's the case. Linear models
are just better, right? We've seen a

56
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.935
little of this before but we're going to
go into more detail. Linear models are

57
00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:52.329
just better than just sort of thinking off
the cuff. Then I'm also going to criticize

58
00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.523
a little bit, right? Because I'm gonna say
one problem with big coefficient is it

59
00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:58.917
only works in the area in which we've got
the data. And oftentimes, if we want to

60
00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:02.661
make the world a lot better place we have
to shift into an entirely new reality.

61
00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:06.546
We've got to shift to a place where there
is no data. So I'm gonna draw distinction

62
00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:10.290
between what I call the big coefficient,
and what I'm gonna call the new reality.

63
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.081
Brighter situations that are just maybe a
lot better than what we currently have.

64
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:17.779
Alright, so that's a summary of where
we're gonna go. We're gonna start out with

65
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.430
categorical models, then linear models,
show how to fit lines to data, right? And

66
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.361
we're gonna do some nonlinear models, and
then we'll wrap it all up by talking about

67
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:27.702
this idea of the big coefficient. Alright,
thank you.
