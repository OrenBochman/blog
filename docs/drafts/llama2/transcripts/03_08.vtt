00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
Hi. In this lecture, we're gonna talk
about a very simple class of models that

2
00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.501
helps us make sense of data and these are
known as categorical models. In a

3
00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:13.266
categorical model, what you do is you
basically bin reality into different

4
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:17.336
categories, and you hope these categories
help you make better sense of the data.

5
00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:21.305
That they explain some of the variation in
the data. I wanna start out by just

6
00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:25.630
describing what a categorical model's like
and we'll talk about how they can help us

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.442
make sense of data. So let me give an
example. A long time ago, over a decade

8
00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:33.041
ago I was at a conference in Amazon, which
is a company that, you know, sells all

9
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.364
sorts of stuff over the web, [laugh]
right? Had, was just going public. And

10
00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:40.101
there was a discussion whether Amazon was
a good investment or not. So one person

11
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.793
who was a Wall Street investor said, you
know, I think it's a horrible investment.

12
00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:47.484
If you think of Amazon all it is, is it's
just a delivery company. Like they just

13
00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:51.268
got a big warehouse, you order stuff, they
deliver it. The margins in that industry

14
00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:55.144
are really small. Like there's already UPS
and EPX, [laugh] UPS and FedEx and DHL and

15
00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:58.690
all those sorta places. I just don't think
there's any money in it. Now, another

16
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.068
person said, you know what, I'm gonna put
Amazon in a very different box. I'm gonna

17
00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:05.530
put this box over here in a box that says
information, because I think its part of

18
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.908
the new information economy. They're gonna
gather all this information about what

19
00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:12.077
consumers want. It's all going to be
centrally held. They're gonna be worth a

20
00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:15.970
ton of money. Now it turns out if you put
Amazon in this information box, you

21
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.118
probably would have invested in it, and
you'd have made a lot money. If you put

22
00:01:20.118 --> 00:01:24.533
Amazon in this delivery box, you wouldn't
have invested in it, and you wouldn't have

23
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:28.734
made a lot of money. So which box you use
[inaudible] how you categorize things

24
00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:33.001
affects how you think about things. And,
again, what sort of decisions you make. So

25
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.523
this leads to a phrase that one of my
friends who's a physcholy, a psychologist

26
00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:41.988
[laugh] once said, lump to live. What my
friend meant is this, is that, we create

27
00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:46.681
these lumps, these boxes, these categories
in order to make sense of the world. So I

28
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:51.260
look out there in the street and I see a
vehicle. I don't say oh it looks like a

29
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.439
1997 Ford F150 pickup truck, right?
Instead I just say truck or I just say

30
00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.961
car. Or if I look at a piece of furniture
I just say it's a dresser. I don't say

31
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:04.368
it's an 1874 Chip N Dale dresser. I don't
completely break it down. I just put

32
00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:08.096
things in categories. And these
[inaudible]. They're short cuts, right?

33
00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:12.048
They help us make sense of the world. And
let's think about why we model again,

34
00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.950
right? One of the reasons we model is to
help us decide, strategize and design.

35
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.585
Right. So one of the reasons we lump is it
helps us make quicker faster decisions

36
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.581
where we just put things in categories and
say this is something I like, this is

37
00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:28.726
something I don't like, this is something
that's risky, this is something that's not

38
00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:32.471
risky. Let me give some examples. Give
some fun examples. So the first one is

39
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:36.467
let's suppose you?re a kid and you gotta
decide what am I gonna eat and what am I

40
00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:40.013
not gonna eat. Well one sorta
categorization you might use is the green

41
00:02:40.013 --> 00:02:44.888
categorization. So you might say anything
that's green. Proxy screen. A

42
00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:49.515
grasshopper's green, asparagus is green.
All these things are green, right?

43
00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:54.206
Everything else, bananas, those are
yellow. Candy bars, brown, orange, they're

44
00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:58.576
orange. Pears, pears can be green, but
we'll assume they're yellow. And

45
00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:03.059
strawberries, they're red. These other
things aren't green. And so your rule

46
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.966
could be, I'm gonna eat anything that's
not green and I won't eat anything that's

47
00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.631
green. And so that rule will keep you safe
from things like grasshoppers and

48
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:14.441
asparagus. Right, so that's a rule you
might follow. Now it's not an optimal rule

49
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.251
because you might run into a green pear
and that green pear might be something

50
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:21.820
you'd really like but if you've been
avoiding green things, you may decide,

51
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.626
well not gonna risk it. So that the same,
an example of a simple rule. Let's now

52
00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:29.889
show how you can use a rule like that to
make sense of data. So now let's suppose

53
00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.153
I've got a bunch of data here, and these
are different food items, and what you've

54
00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:38.101
got in this column right here are
calories. So this is how many calories

55
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:42.259
there are in each of these, these food
items. So what I want to do is I'm trying,

56
00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:46.680
I wanna make sense of why do some things
have a lot of calories and some things not

57
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.839
have a lot of calories. And so I've got
this list of items. Well the first thing

58
00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:55.401
that I need to try to make sense of is how
much variation is there in this data. Well

59
00:03:55.401 --> 00:04:01.308
to understand how much variation there is,
first I've got to find out, sort of what's

60
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:06.653
the average value? And then variation
tells me, how far are things, on average,

61
00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:11.857
from that value? So if I add all this up,
I've got a 100+250 that's 350, 440, 550,

62
00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:17.246
900 right? So we've got 900 divided by
five, so that means the mean here Is 180,

63
00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:21.773
so on average, everything in this group
has about 180 calories. And I want to ask

64
00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:26.301
some things are higher. Right? This is 350
and some things are lower, this is 90. I

65
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:30.732
want some understanding of how much
variation is in that data. So one way to

66
00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:35.870
do that we just subtract the mean from
everything. So if we take 100 minus 180

67
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.007
that's gonna be minus 80. 250 minus 80
that's gonna be 70. 90 minus 180 that's

68
00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:46.672
minus 90, right? 110 minus 180 is minus 70
and 350 minus 80 is 170. Well if I add all

69
00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:51.546
these things up I'm gonna get minus 80,
plus 70, minus 90, minus 170, plus 70,

70
00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:56.750
it's be zero because it's gonna be the
same as a mean. So what I need is I need

71
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.151
all these differences to be positive. So
one thing I can do is I can just take the

72
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:07.976
absolute value. Of all these things.
Right? And then I could add up the

73
00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:15.170
absolute value. And I could get 80 plus 70
is 150. Plus 90 is 240. Plus 70 is 310.

74
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.317
Plus one 70 is 480. So we could say, the
total difference from the mean is 480. But

75
00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:25.529
what we do in statistics, is we tend to do
something different. We actually tend to

76
00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.469
take the difference and square it. And the
reason we square it is really twofold. One

77
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.637
is that again it makes everything
positive, which is what it did before. And

78
00:05:34.637 --> 00:05:38.695
the other thing is that it amplifies
larger deviations. Because what we'd

79
00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:43.086
really like to do is prevent those huge
deviations. This is gonna amplify large

80
00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:47.255
deviations. So if I look at the pair, I
would have 100 minus 180, which is 80

81
00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:51.757
squared which is 6,400. So that's how much
variation there would be. So that's the,

82
00:05:51.757 --> 00:05:56.851
how much the. Difference from the pair,
pair to the mean squared. And if

83
00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:02.987
[inaudible] for the cake, I'm gonna get
250-180 which is 70. And if I square that,

84
00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:08.649
right, I'm gonna get 4900. Now I could do
this for everything. All of them right? So

85
00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:12.687
for the pear, I get sixty four hundred,
for the cake I get forty nine hundred, for

86
00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:16.725
the apple eighty one, for the banana forty
nine, for the pie, twenty eight [laugh],

87
00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:20.712
thousand, nine hundred. So this is again,
a long way from the mean, and you square

88
00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:24.851
it at a huge effect, so square amplifies
larger mistakes. Now if I add up all these

89
00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:28.990
numbers, I'm gonna get fifty three twenty.
That's what we call a total variation. So

90
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.876
I plotted that data, this tells me sort
of, how much variation is in that data,

91
00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:37.318
what I'd like to do is keep. [inaudible]
categories [inaudible] that reduces that

92
00:06:37.318 --> 00:06:41.604
variation that somehow explains why
something are high and some things are

93
00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:46.115
low. So what's the obvious.
Categorization. The obvious categorization

94
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:51.951
here is that pears and apples and bananas
are fruit and cakes and pies, right, are

95
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:57.936
desserts. So let's create a fruit category
and a dessert category. So in the fruit,

96
00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:03.792
I've got one thing that's 90, one thing
that's 100 and one thing that's 110. And

97
00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:09.647
in the dessert category, I've got one
thing that's 250 and one thing that's 350.

98
00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:16.343
So let's look at them in more detail. I've
got 90,100, 110, the mean Is gonna be 100

99
00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:21.869
here, right? The average is also 100.
What's the total variation? Well, 90 minus

100
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:31.755
100. Is just ten, so if I square that, I
get 100. 100 minus 100. Right. Is zero, so

101
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:39.510
if I square that, I get zero. And one ten
minus 100. Is also ten, so if I square

102
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:45.377
that, I get 100. So the total variation
here is just gonna be 100+100 or 200. So

103
00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:51.560
now what I've done is I've got a mean of
100, and a total variation of 200. And

104
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.665
now, if I go to this case, the mean is
gonna be 300, right, for the desserts. And

105
00:07:57.665 --> 00:08:03.849
what's the total variation? Well, for the
cake, it's 250-300, which is 50 squared,

106
00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:09.588
which is 2500. And for the pie, it's
350-300, which is also 50 squared. Which

107
00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:14.061
is 2500 [inaudible]. Add those up, I get
5000. Alright, so let's clean this up a

108
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:18.592
little bit. So what I did is by creating
two categories, a fruit category and a

109
00:08:18.592 --> 00:08:23.414
dessert category, I now have a mean in the
fruit category of 100 and a variation of

110
00:08:23.414 --> 00:08:27.945
200, and a mean in the dessert category of
300 and a variation of 5000. Now one

111
00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:32.805
[inaudible] I started out with, right?
When I had all the stuff together. I had a

112
00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:40.269
mean of 180 and I had a variation. Of
53,200. Now look at how much my variation

113
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:45.959
has gone down. It went from 53,000 to
5,000. So here's to the idea. These

114
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.360
categories substantially reduce the amount
of variation I have left over. So think of

115
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.605
the variation as what's unexplained. So
initially I say look I can just say things

116
00:08:54.605 --> 00:08:58.851
on average of 180 calories and we've got
53,000 units of variation that's [laugh]

117
00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:03.148
unexplained. Now I say wait a minute, I'm
gonna create a categorical model that says

118
00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:07.342
there's fruit in desserts and fruits have
few calories than desserts. And you can

119
00:09:07.342 --> 00:09:11.587
say we?ll look it appears to be the case.
Fruits have a mean of 100. Desserts have a

120
00:09:11.587 --> 00:09:15.574
mean of 300 and the variation in the
fruits is only 200 and the variation in

121
00:09:15.574 --> 00:09:19.971
the desserts is 5,000. So I've reduced
variation a ton. What we want is we want a

122
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:24.959
formal measure of how much we've reduced
variation. That's actually fairly simple,

123
00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:29.947
right? So that a total variation of 5300,
fruit variation is 200, dessert variation

124
00:09:29.947 --> 00:09:36.669
is 5000. So that gives me 5200. So 53,000
start and I get 5200 left. So what we

125
00:09:36.669 --> 00:09:48.581
wanna ask is how much did I explain.
That's the question. How much of that

126
00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:56.989
radiation did I explain? Well, then I
started out with 53,000, right 200. And

127
00:09:56.989 --> 00:10:06.548
now I only have 5,200 left over and so the
amount I explained is just 53,000 minus

128
00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:13.988
5,000 right which is 48,000 right. >> Over
53, two. So the percentage of [inaudible]

129
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:19.286
I explained was 48,000 divided by 53,000
which is a huge amount. And I can write

130
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:24.318
this more simply as just one minus the
amount I didn't, that's left over. One

131
00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:29.152
minus 5,200 over 53,000. So, right?
Because that's just a simpler way to do

132
00:10:29.152 --> 00:10:34.450
it. And so when I get that the amount of
[inaudible] I explained was 90 thou- 90

133
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:40.195
percent. So 90.2%. So that's how much of
that variation I explained. This is equal

134
00:10:40.195 --> 00:10:45.778
to, again, that 48,000 right, divided by
53,200, the amount of variation that I

135
00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:51.582
explained. Now, formally, this is called
the R squared. So this is the [inaudible],

136
00:10:51.582 --> 00:10:56.357
the percentage of variation that I
explained just by that simple

137
00:10:56.357 --> 00:11:01.507
categorization. So, if the R squared is
near one. That means I explained almost

138
00:11:01.507 --> 00:11:06.028
all the variation, so the model explains a
lot. Right? If the R squared is near zero,

139
00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:10.186
that means I didn't explain any of the
variation really, and the model doesn't

140
00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:14.290
explain very much at all. Now the better
the model, the more R large R squared

141
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:18.713
it'll have. But depending on, there could
be so much variation in the data that even

142
00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:22.402
a great model. Only has an r squared of
five or ten%. There also could be

143
00:11:22.402 --> 00:11:26.687
situations where the thing you're trying
to explain in pretty understandable and a

144
00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:30.610
good model has to have an r squared of
90%. So there's no fixed rules whether,

145
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.688
you know, what a good r squared is. It
depends what the data looks like. But with

146
00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:38.972
a class, you know sort of class of models,
or you know that's [inaudible] data class,

147
00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:42.809
you can sorta figure out this is a good
model, this is a bad model. Based on

148
00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:46.345
experience. Let's push this a little bit
further. We had, you know, fruit and

149
00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:49.593
desserts, right? Those are our two
categories. But if I had, you know, a

150
00:11:49.593 --> 00:11:53.271
whole kitchen worth of food, it may be the
case, that, like, I'd wanna have more

151
00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:57.236
categories. So I might create a vegetable
category and a grains category. And then I

152
00:11:57.236 --> 00:12:01.234
could put everything in one of these four
boxes. So one of the differences between

153
00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:05.445
sort of experts and nonexperts is experts
tend to have more boxes. They also tend to

154
00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:09.455
put the right things in the right boxes,
so they tend to have useful boxes. So if

155
00:12:09.455 --> 00:12:13.466
you want to be good at sort of predicting
things or understanding how the world

156
00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:17.376
works, what you have to have is a lot of
categories and you have to have those

157
00:12:17.376 --> 00:12:20.935
categories be the right categories.
They've got to explain a lot of the

158
00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:24.845
variation. And we can measure how much of
the variation it explains, your model

159
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:30.304
explains, by using that R squared. One
last point. Even if you explain a lot of

160
00:12:30.304 --> 00:12:34.539
variation, it doesn't mean you've got a
good model. Let's go back to the schools

161
00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:38.720
case. So suppose I'm trying to figure out
what makes a good school, what really

162
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.008
leads to a good school performance. So I
try all sorts of different boxes. I look

163
00:12:43.008 --> 00:12:47.190
at schools that spend a lot of money
versus schools that don't spend a lot of

164
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.639
money. Schools that have small class sizes
and big class sizes. Schools that are big

165
00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:55.820
and schools that are small, right? And
nothing really seems to explain too much

166
00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.765
of the variation. And then I create a box
that I call the equestrian box. And I put

167
00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:06.104
all the schools in here that have
equestrian teams. And I find, oh my

168
00:13:06.104 --> 00:13:12.228
goodness, every school with an equestrian
team is great. Well, the thing is, that

169
00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:18.666
doesn't mean that the equestrian team made
the school good, right? So statisticians

170
00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:23.453
make a distinction between correlation.
Which is, is there a statistical

171
00:13:23.453 --> 00:13:27.679
relationship between having an equestrian
team and being a good school? And

172
00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:32.299
causation, did the equestrian team cause
the school to be good? So remember when we

173
00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:36.750
draw, when you think about putting it in
this box. Like, this box right here is a

174
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.145
bunch of good outcomes. And this box here
has mostly bad outcomes. That doesn't

175
00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:45.484
necessarily mean that the thing that
created this box, if it's the equestrian

176
00:13:45.484 --> 00:13:49.343
box. Is the reason that the schools were
good. It could be that there's some other

177
00:13:49.343 --> 00:13:52.646
reason. So why would you have an
equestrian team? Well you only have an

178
00:13:52.646 --> 00:13:56.279
equestrian team if you had a lot of money.
And you probably also only have an

179
00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:59.818
equestrian team if you have a lot of
parental involvement, things like that.

180
00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:03.641
Like a lot of support from the community.
And you only have an equestrian team if

181
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.416
you have a lot of open space. So it could
be that having an equestrian team is a

182
00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:10.813
proxy for things like money, parental
involvement, open space, right, those

183
00:14:10.813 --> 00:14:14.541
sorts of things that actually do make a
school good. So even if your boxes work,

184
00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:18.581
that's no guarantee that they're actually
the cause of why it works. Okay, so what

185
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:23.697
do we have? We have one way, [inaudible]
the simplest model you can possibly have

186
00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:28.429
is a character model. You can say, Amazon
is a delivery company. Amazon's an

187
00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:33.481
information company. You can say things
are either fruits or desserts. Right? And

188
00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:38.470
by creating these boxes it can help you
sort of explain the variation in data.

189
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.990
What we saw then is a simple way to
measure how good a categorization is, is

190
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.570
how much of that you explained the
percentage of the variation you explained

191
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.971
and that's what we called R squared,
right? R squared was just take all the

192
00:14:51.971 --> 00:14:56.967
variation that was there and then ask how
much was left how much was left over. That

193
00:14:56.967 --> 00:15:01.844
means and then we subtract those two that
tells you how much you explained. So you

194
00:15:01.844 --> 00:15:07.981
ask what percentage of all that variation
do you. Let me start over. Okay, what have

195
00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:12.699
we learned. What we've learned is this.
We've learned that the simplest kind of

196
00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:16.307
model you can have is just a category
based model, right where you just sorta

197
00:15:16.307 --> 00:15:20.150
lump the world in different categories,
and you place your data in different boxes

198
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.133
depending on what different data it is. So
that could be information companies versus

199
00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:27.741
delivery companies. That could be fruits
and desserts, right? And in doing that,

200
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:31.490
what you could do is you can reduce the
amount of variation you see in the data.

201
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.145
So there's a total variation which is
sorta of just like how much unexplained

202
00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:38.847
variation there was out there in the
world, by putting it in boxes you organize

203
00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:42.660
it in such a way that you reduce the
variation. The amount at which you reduce

204
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.609
the variation is what we call the r
squared. That's the percent of variation

205
00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:50.453
explained. And the more variation
explained the better your categorization

206
00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:54.713
is. Of course if you create more boxes you
can explain more of the variation. Where

207
00:15:54.713 --> 00:15:58.558
we're going next, if you've got linear
models, which in effect can create a

208
00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:03.370
different box for each value of x, our
dependent variable. Okay, thanks.
