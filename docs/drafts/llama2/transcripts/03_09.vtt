00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.817
Alright. In this lecture we're going to
talk about linear models. Now in linear

2
00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.857
models what you do is you see that there's
some, independent variable. X. And this is

3
00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:14.133
a variable that, that, could be anything.
It could be hours spent exercising. It

4
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:18.575
could be money spent on advertising. It
could be anything that you want. And then

5
00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:23.141
you assume that there's some other
variable. Y. Dead is a function of X. So

6
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:29.249
if X is hours spent exercising Y could be
life expectancy. If X is amount of money

7
00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.134
you spend on advertising then Y can be
sells. Now what we do is we assume there

8
00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:41.392
is a particular relationship between Y and
X that it's not any old function. In fact

9
00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:46.904
what we do is we assume it's a simple
line. So here's X, here's Y. We assume

10
00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:52.532
that we can write Y= MX + B. That Y is
just a linear function. X. So formally

11
00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:58.260
right, you see the [inaudible] typical
graph and y on this axis and here is X. B

12
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.061
is the intercept. So this is representing
Y equals M X plus B. If X equals zero, B

13
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:10.006
is the value that Y will take. And then M
right is gives the slope. So tells u sort

14
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:15.589
of how fast is it's going up. How fast
this thing is going up. You can move or

15
00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:21.444
you can increase X by one. How much does Y
get increased? Now remember I talked about

16
00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:26.570
the difference between a linear model and
a line. So, in a line, we just have that

17
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.056
equation, Y=MX+B. In a linear model, what
we're assuming is that there's some

18
00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:35.926
independent variable X, there's some
dependent variable Y. And Y depends on X,

19
00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:40.336
or assuming that X somehow causes Y to
occur. All right. Let's do an example,

20
00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:44.203
simple example. Suppose you think about
buying a TV, and you want to know, how

21
00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:48.172
much is that TV gonna cost? So I wanna
construct a linear model of the cost of

22
00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:51.937
the TV. So let's let x be the length of
the diagonal, right? So you get your

23
00:01:51.937 --> 00:01:55.804
square screen, right? And then TVs are
measured by the diagonal. That way they

24
00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:59.722
can pretend the TV's bigger than it really
is. 'Kay, so x is the length of the

25
00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:04.340
diagonal. Y is the cost of the TV and
suppose you say here is my linear model. I

26
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.917
think the cost is fifteen times the length
in inches. Plus a $100. So you put a

27
00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:13.374
dollar sign here, to show this is a
hundred dollars. That could be the model

28
00:02:13.374 --> 00:02:18.517
of what it costs for a TV. Now there's two
things you wanna think about when you have

29
00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:23.213
these two linear models. First is the sign
of that coefficient. So, if I have y

30
00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:27.908
equals 5x. Right, that five is positive
that's says y is increasing an x. So in

31
00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:32.726
the case of the TV, we expect the price of
the TV to go up as it gets bigger. So

32
00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:37.525
expect the sign to be positive. Second
thing we care about is the magnitude. How

33
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:41.973
big is that coefficient? So how much does
the price go up every time you make X

34
00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:46.365
figure by one? So when you think about
using these in policy settings, right? So

35
00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:50.419
suppose you know that school lunches
[inaudible] school lunches improve

36
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.924
performance. Well, the sign on that would
be, well, is performance higher if people

37
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:59.034
get school lunches, right? So is there a
positive coefficient? So why do we

38
00:02:59.034 --> 00:03:03.443
construct models, right? Bunch of reasons,
one though is to predict, right? Another

39
00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:08.002
is to understand data. So let's talk about
just using this simple model to try and

40
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:12.116
predict. So supposed you're thinking
about, wonder what it cost to buy a 30

41
00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:16.230
inch TV, what we can, is we can plug it
in. And so the cost would be fifteen.

42
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.789
Times the diagonal. Plus 100. So what that
would be is 450. Plus 100, which should be

43
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:28.875
$550. So that would say if I want to go
buy a 30-inch TV, it's gonna cost me $550.

44
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.170
And so if that's, if we had a good model,
this would be what a TV costs, if we had a

45
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.361
bad model, this would be way off base. But
let's suppose this is your model, and I

46
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.342
think you can use it, you can use it to
predict things that maybe don't even

47
00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:45.481
exist. So suppose you think, what if they
made a 100-inch TV, how much would that

48
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:49.252
cost? Well, if you assume this same
relationship holds, you could just say,

49
00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:55.576
well, I'm gonna say, the cost should be
fifteen. Times a 100, plus a 100. Which is

50
00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:59.606
gonna be 1,600. So we can make, 100
[inaudible] will be $1,600 [laugh] okay

51
00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:03.911
so. Maybe wanna sit around and wait for
that 100 [inaudible] to come around. Or

52
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.272
maybe $1,600 is too rich for your blood.
You're gonna say well you know what. I'm

53
00:04:08.272 --> 00:04:12.577
happy with the 30 incher. Okay, and again
what you can use this model for is to

54
00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:16.773
predict. Now the model might not be
accurate, right because the world may not

55
00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:20.857
be linear. But as a benchmark, this isn't
really a bad thing to do. Now also

56
00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:25.163
understanding data rate. There's all these
data here, right. These are all these

57
00:04:25.163 --> 00:04:29.672
dots.1 Thing you can do is with your model
rate is you can. Think okay, how well can

58
00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:33.952
I fit a line through there? Now let's go
back to our last lecture from, remember in

59
00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:38.127
our last lecture we talked about R
squared, how much of the variation can you

60
00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:42.198
explain. Well there's a lot of variation
in this data. Well you can do the same

61
00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.414
thing with a line. You can ask, how far is
this data line from my line? Right? And so

62
00:04:46.414 --> 00:04:50.008
how much of that total variation I
explained by just that drawing that line

63
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:53.271
through there. So you can do the same
exact thing that you do for the

64
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:56.675
categories, for the lines, and that's
we're actually gonna do in the next

65
00:04:56.675 --> 00:05:00.458
lecture. But for now, I just wanna get
across this idea that you can use a linear

66
00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:04.554
model to try and make sense of a data like
this and also to make predictions. Here's

67
00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:09.748
the thing. Remember I said, first lecture,
that models are better than we are. Well

68
00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:15.137
let me support that even with these simple
models. So Robyn Dawes, who?s at Carnegie

69
00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:20.072
Mellon, in 1979, wrote a paper comparing
very, very primitive linear models. So,

70
00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:25.006
all he worried about is sorta getting the
coefficient close to right. So, for

71
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:29.876
example, here's one case, he had 43 bank
loan officers and they're trying to

72
00:05:29.876 --> 00:05:34.129
predict whether. These firms were gonna go
belly up or not, because they'd repay

73
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.086
their loans. And so they were given 60
loans, 30 of which they, it was already

74
00:05:38.086 --> 00:05:41.938
known had failed, and 30 if which was
already known had succeeded. And they

75
00:05:41.938 --> 00:05:45.999
asked these people to predict what was
gonna happen. Now, these bankers, they're

76
00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:49.435
pretty smart. They were 75 percent
accurate, so that's actually pretty good.

77
00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:53.391
But if you took a simple linear model,
just based on that ratio of assets to

78
00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:57.139
liabilities of the people taking out the
loans. That was right 80 percent of the

79
00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.693
time. So the models beat the people. That,
say fine, that's one example. This has

80
00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:06.584
been studied in detail right. So in 1954,
[inaudible] did a study, twenty studies of

81
00:06:06.584 --> 00:06:11.176
clinicians, so these are doctors, right,
making predictions versus just doing a

82
00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:16.066
simple linear model. And Sawyer in 1966
did 45 studies of predictions out there in

83
00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:20.594
the social world. All 65 of these studies
it is never, never the case that the

84
00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:25.514
experts did significantly better than the
linear models. So there's cases where they

85
00:06:25.514 --> 00:06:29.673
were close, right where the expert?s maybe
a little better but it wasn't

86
00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:34.300
significantly better. And there were a ton
of cases where the linear models did

87
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.752
better. So if you do a horse race, right.
Linear models tend to be better than

88
00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:43.028
experts. Remember we saw this, this is
that tetlock, this is the graph from

89
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:48.104
tetlock again. Here's formal models way up
here- Right? And, this is, again, this is

90
00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:53.836
measuring how [inaudible] how good those
models are at explaining variation. What

91
00:06:53.836 --> 00:06:58.935
you get is that formal models are better
than people are. Now again, you don't

92
00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:03.250
wanna only rely on the formal model. What
you'd like to do is, do the linear model.

93
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.046
And compare that linear model to your own
judgment. Okay, so what have we done? What

94
00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:13.294
we've done is we've shown that you can
draw a line through data and use that line

95
00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:17.490
to explain some of the variation in the
data. Now typically the world isn't gonna

96
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.531
be perfectly linear. There's going to be
lots of extra variation left over, but

97
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.313
there's a question of how much of that
variation did the line explain. In

98
00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:29.198
addition to explaining the variation, the
line tells us something about the

99
00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:33.188
relationship between our independent
variable, x and our dependent variable, y.

100
00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:37.228
In particular, we learn the sine on x,
like does y increase in x or decrease in

101
00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:41.436
x, and we also learn something about the
magnitude, so how much does. Each one unit

102
00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:45.802
increase of x increased the value of y. So
what this linear model can do is help us

103
00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:50.221
understand something about data we see in
the real world. Now what we've done so far

104
00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:54.219
though, right, is just consider a single
variable linear model, right? So y was

105
00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:58.690
just a function of x. Where we're gonna go
next is to think of y depending on a whole

106
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.899
bunch of different x's. So you can think
of your outcome having a whole bunch of

107
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:07.317
different variables that contribute to it,
and we'll start out by seeing how each of

108
00:08:07.317 --> 00:08:10.945
those variables contribute in a linear
way. Okay, thank you.
