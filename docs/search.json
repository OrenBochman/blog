    "text": "Back when I was staying in Budapest I took some Hungarian classes at the “Debreceni Nyári Egyetem”. After a year I got through some of the basic levels. I a book store with some titles by their publisher’s at greatly reduced prices so I bought “Igéző szotar”, a dictionary of phrasal verbs. However I found a too advanced to be very useful at the time.\nIt turns out most Hungarian verbs can take up to 20 prefixes to form a phrasal verb. Some of these are not always intuitive and can be very idiomatic. However there are only 20 prefixes and these prefixes are related to postpositions that attach to nouns as suffixes.\nIt seems to offer a quick windfall for expanding your vocabulary. The conjugation of Hungarian verb can easily take as many as 70 forms. Once we factor in the number of prefixes the number of forms quickly jumps to as many as 1400. This is a huge number of forms to learn. However the good news is that the conjugation of the main verb is the same for all the phrasal verbs that are formed with the same prefix. Even better news is once you mastered all the phrasal verbs for just two of three verb your eyes will be able to decipher any other phrasal verb that you come across.\nAlso the Hungarian lexicon is highly agglutinative. This means that you might encounter a word embedded within some other word. For example a computer is called a “szamitogep” which is a compound word made up of “szamit” which means to calculate and “gep” which means machine. Or to photograph which is “fenykepezik” which is made up of “feny” which means light and “kep” which means picture.\nYou might not know the exact meaning of the phrasal verb but you will be able to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb but you should be able to partition the verb into a prefix, the main verb and the conjugation suffix. You will have a rough idea of what each of these might mean and you might now also be better able to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb based on the context in which it is used. At least if you are able to make sense the words belonging to the phrasal verb slots.\nOnce you have mastered the conjugation of any of the main verb these phrasal verbs follow the same conjugation rules. This means that with little more work you are well on your way to mastering many semantically related phrasal verbs. The outcome is that the vocabulary of the language is highly regular and mostly predictable.\nThe challenge isn’t the prefixes but what semantics slots become available when you add a prefix to a verb. This is where the idiomatic nature of the language comes into play. Because we are now talking about a new semantic space that part is not always predictable.\nHowever this is a case where we can transfer the semantics of the verb from say english.\nit has no English translation. However there is a smaller volume that goes along that is bilingual\nIt is It is a dictionary of verbs that are conjugated in various ways.\nThe prefixes\nthis makes use of many abbreviations"

For any given corpus size combining enough features (i.e. conditioning, quickly leads to sparsity which means it would be hard to find a threshold for a confidence interval separating real constructs from noise.\nIn (Pajzs 2002) the authors only considered a few common verbs to work with\nthe main advantage for this approach might be that one would also have frequencies, possibly by year and thus be able to prioritize language learning tasks."

Define pivots tables using drag and drop.\nFinally bushiness analysts often use BI tools and while R has Shiny Python is kind of weak in this regard as well particularly when working in a notebook.\nSo can we bridge this divide and make ourselves as agile and efficent on pandas as an analyst is in Excel ?",

    "text": "Pandas or Point and Click\nPandas is Python’s programmatic spreadsheet based on R’s DataFrames. R community is very pragmatic and the data frames have evolved to improve performance and increase agility. They have a tidyverse package and tribbles. Pandas lags behind and while easier to code then R it often requires more code to get things done and the code can get pretty ugly. Pandas advocates often point out that spreadsheets fail around 1.5 million cells. But what they fail to mention is that getting pandas to be fast on a large dataset requires deep understanding of pandas, its api, numpy. I won’t even go into memory management. I’d say most of the ugly code is going to be very slow on big data and you’ll run out of memory. While SQL and excel have had serious effort at optimizing performance - pandas is pretty pathetic in this regard.\nI expected Pandas to be fast and intuitive on tasks like\n\nsubsetting by column type\nprinting subset rows by criteria of several columns\n\nThe first thing I expected is to be able to do tasks I did with excel or google sheets faster and better. What I mean is that I expected to map most tasks from one to the other and to be able to automate faster. Some tasks map better then others.",

I had also expected a modern functional interface to process data using RX style coding via functional primitives like map, flatmap, groupby, zip, filter, and so on. I notched some exist but no one seems to be using them in the idiomatic way. R’s tidyverse and Magrit had evolved very quickly in this direction why didn’t pandas?\nThe two biggest disappointments are reports and dashboards. Reports in excel are a no-brainer. Solid reporting can be essential when taking a data pipeline to production. Dashboards are a both a productivity enhancer and a power multiplier in BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio, informatica etc. Interactive dashboards can be amazing for exploring datasets that change a lot like marketing. These are all challenges with python and pandas in a Jupyter notebook as a starting point.\nWhile hacking functional programming into pandas should be not to hard I believe that engineering it would be more sensible as it would allow high performance optimizations for larger datasets.",

And now all images default to opening within their own lightbox when clicked upon.\nto disable the feature say, on a logo for example just add .no-lightbox css style to the image like this:\n![caption](filename.png){.no-lightbox}\nif you want to be able to scroll through a series of images we need to decorate each images as follows:\n![caption](filename.png){group=\"my-gallery\"}\nAn added bonus is that it is possible to zoom into these light-boxed images",

    "section": "Localised subspace embedding",
    "text": "Localised subspace embedding\nThe idea of embedings which allow us to use a distributed representation instead of a one hot encoding is very powerful. In one sense it is the opposite of the reductionist notion mentioned above. Instead of trying to find the best features we are trying to find the best representation of the features. However if one is familiar with PCA or SVD one knows that the best representation is often some linear combination of the actual features we observe. A reductionist might view these a generlized coordinates that are more useful for inverstigating the feature space.\nIf our features are built from such embeddings, we learn weights that correspond to the importance of the features in the model. This representation is still subject to the bias variance tradeoff and we generaly have many parameters in Neural Networks. One way to view this is to try and orgeinze the model so that it can use emebeddings of subspaces - corresponding to features that are balance generlization and discrimination.\nA second point is that in different contexts we might need to use different features. This is much easier to see in RL and NLP. Building a embedding that is localised to a just some features and some observations/states might allow the model to get good generalization then by considering all the features at once. This is an analogue of the idea of factoring a distribution into a product of marginals, particularly in the case of a much larger bayesian network. In this case though we might be talking about using two such factorizations, with some discriminator selecting the observations that are used in different contexts.\nWe might think of a neural network as evolving system of that learns to bifurcate the distributed representation of the features of the data set in the input into any number of\nsmaller and more localised subspaces. The more Localised subspaces are more likely to be linearly separable and thus easier to learn.\nHowever all this happens by breaking symmetries using the random aspects of the learning algorithm. Minibatches present many random samples which carry differnt payloads of information. Certain such payloads may reinforce the current network weights, while the next may require a bifurcation of the representation into two to minimize the loss. Another might require many bifurcations and may not lead to any new bifurcations or reinforcements. Drop out breaks symmetries by shutting down parts of the network temporarily.\nOn other problems with generalization in RL and in NLP might be resolved using local subspace embedding of the state space. These are features that conflates states that are similar and distinguishes states that are different. By avoiding a full embedding we reduce the variance of the function approximation and thus improve generalization.",

This would need learning different weights for the different verbs. This means we want to bifurcate the verb fearture subnetwork into two replicates but add the discriminator as a gate to the input of the two subnetworks.\nanother point worth considering is that once we have learned a good representation of both\nthe transitive and intransitive verbs we can use these as features in the next layers of the network. We sould be able to combine them to get a better representation than just the original verb.\nI recon this happens many times in LLMs. What we might want is to have some way for the model to attend to all the subspaces it has learned and use them to guide its learning.\nThe challange seems to be in identification of the subspaces. We may be using differnt basis for each subspace etc which may lead to difficulty in reusing them.",

    "title": "Roth Erev learning in Lewis signaling games",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wish now to implement learning in the Lewis signaling game. In the book some reinforcement learning RL algorithms are presented in some detail and a few variations are mentioned. It worthwhile pointing out that the book statement of the algorithms is good enough to understand how the algorithms operate in general. However some of the details required to implement the algorithms were glossed over. As my one time collage Yuri Stool like to point out, “the devil is in the details.”\nI ended up implementing the algorithms a number of times - once to get it to work, second time to develop my own algorithm as I gained new insights into the problems. A third time after reading more of the papers whihc suggested how more details on conducting experiments which led to a deeper understanding of enumerating and ranking the partial pooling equilibria. The point here is that natural language is mostly a separating equilibrium - most words are unambiguous but there are a significant subset of words that have multiple meaning and there are many synonyms. Mechanisms in the lexicon seem to eventually resolves some ambiguities while letting others persist indefinitely. So while the separating equilibria are of primary interests in reality users if signaling systems satisfice with a systems that is good enough. This are the much more common partial pooling variants with high degree of separation plus a context based disambiguation mechanism. I consider the erosion of English and Latin conjugation and declination after the classical period as a simpler contextual disambiguation mechanism dismantling a nearly perfect signaling subsystem with a rather degenerate one with high degree of partial pooling. A simulation might show how a few prepositions and auxilary verbs are more efficent to learn and process than fully inflected systems of case and verb ending (especially if modified by phonetics). But my guess is that this happened as more speakers had to master an use a core language, without access to resources for learning the classical forms. I guess the dark ages and a decline in literacy likely speed up the process.\nAdding better analysis, estimating expected returns for a set of weights, tracking regret during learning. Considering different path to salience via differntial risks/costs for signals, and non uniform state distribution.\nThe big question seems to be:\nWhat is a simple rl algorithm to evolve and disseminate a signaling system with certain added requirements like\n\ncomplex signals\n\nconjunctive signal aggregation\nordered signal aggregation via learning a grammar like SVO.\nrecursive signal aggregation replacing linear ordered with a partial order.\n\nresolving ambiguity by context\nmechanism for correcting errors (vowel harmony, agreement)\nsimple growth of the lexicon (black bead leads to mutation in the urn model)\nsufficient capacity,\nminimal burden for processing (extending inference mechanism to reduce cognitive load, compress messages, erode unneeded structures)\nminimal burden in learning (e.g. by generalization via regularity in morphology, and syntax)\nhigh accuracy for transmission of messages\nsaliencey - a information theoretic measure of more efficient transition subset of states/messages pairs.\n\nWhere the great unknown seems to be to find a minimal extension to the Lewis game in which all these might evlove.\nHaving stated the problem in detail lets me make the following two observations:\n\nThe aggregation rules for complex signaling should be made to arise by imposing costs on systems under which agents more frequently fail to make good inference with high probability of a partials message’s describing risky states for sender and or receiver.\nA second cost to fitness is the role of mistakes in signaling and or receiving. (ie. adding an small chance for decoding similar sounding signals (homophones, short vs long sounds, hissed and hushed, round, front and back vouwels). This may lead to excluding simple signals from places they might be confused, is it (a,a) (a.a) or (aa,a), (a,_,a) are avoided if signal ‘a’ is excluded from the first positions (say verb class). here dot might be a short pause, comma a long pause, undescore an unmarked slot, and two aa no pause. (either two a or a long a.) if we prefix V with v S with s and P with C\nwe end up with a system that is much more robust. And we may have the added bonus that we can easily detect a tree formation based on multiple Vprefix in the sentence….\n\nword grammar\nsub word grammar - a complex morphology - highly regular yet differented complex signals\nthis could lead to redundancy based Error correction like subject verb agreement, noun adjective agreement or vowel harmony.\nConcord - case agreement (nouns pronouns and adjective are in agreement)\n\nEase of processing\n\nagreement can also ease processing\nassimilation and elision\nlimiting processing/disabihation context windows.\nword order\nhowever redundencies add overhead, making signals longer and may make learning much longer (this is when we students who generelize are wrong and then need to learn via negative examples.\n\nIf many we have different complex signaling systems with minimal mistakes are possible one would prefer a system that is easier to learn. (Shorter lexicon, with lower chances of collision. Shorter grammar, fewer negtive examples, more room for expansion)\n\n\n\n\nwe start with some initial weights, perhaps equal.\nAn act is chosen with probability proportional to its weight.\nThe payoff gained is added to the weight for the act that was chosen,\nand the process repeats\n\n\n\n\n\nset starting weight for each option\nweights evolve by addition of rewards gotten\nprobability of choosing an alternative is proportional to its weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nset starting weight for each option\nweights evolve by addition of rewards gotten\nprobability of choosing an alternative is proportional to its weight.\nif the reward is 0 the weight is multiplied by a forgetting factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nset starting weight for each option\nweights evolve by addition of rewards gotten\nprobability of choosing an alternative is proportional to its weight.\nif the reward is 0 the weight is multiplied by a forgetting factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis is a special purpose rl algorithm for coordination problems where agents need to establish a convention like in the Lewis signaling game. The idea is that the matrix is similar to a placing 8 rooks on on a chess board with no two under attack.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wish now to implement learning in the Lewis signaling game. In the book some reinforcement learning RL algorithms are presented in some detail and a few variations are mentioned. It worthwhile pointing out that the book statement of the algorithms is good enough to understand how the algorithms operate in general. However some of the details required to implement the algorithms were glossed over. As my one time collage Yuri Stool like to point out, “the devil is in the details.”\nI ended up implementing the algorithms a number of times - once to get it to work, second time to develop my own algorithm as I gained new insights into the problems. A third time after reading more of the papers whihc suggested how more details on conducting experiments which led to a deeper understanding of enumerating and ranking the partial pooling equilibria. The point here is that natural language is mostly a separating equilibrium - most words are unambiguous but there are a significant subset of words that have multiple meaning and there are many synonyms. Mechanisms in the lexicon seem to eventually resolves some ambiguities while letting others persist indefinitely. So while the separating equilibria are of primary interests in reality users if signaling systems satisfice with a systems that is good enough. This are the much more common partial pooling variants with high degree of separation plus a context based disambiguation mechanism. I consider the erosion of English and Latin conjugation and declination after the classical period as a simpler contextual disambiguation mechanism dismantling a nearly perfect signaling subsystem with a rather degenerate one with high degree of partial pooling. A simulation might show how a few prepositions and auxilary verbs are more efficent to learn and process than fully inflected systems of case and verb ending (especially if modified by phonetics). But my guess is that this happened as more speakers had to master an use a core language, without access to resources for learning the classical forms. I guess the dark ages and a decline in literacy likely speed up the process.\nAdding better analysis, estimating expected returns for a set of weights, tracking regret during learning. Considering different path to salience via differntial risks/costs for signals, and non uniform state distribution.\nThe big question seems to be:\nWhat is a simple rl algorithm to evolve and disseminate a signaling system with certain added requirements like\n\ncomplex signals\n\nconjunctive signal aggregation\nordered signal aggregation via learning a grammar like SVO.\nrecursive signal aggregation replacing linear ordered with a partial order.\n\nresolving ambiguity by context\nmechanism for correcting errors (vowel harmony, agreement)\nsimple growth of the lexicon (black bead leads to mutation in the urn model)\nsufficient capacity,\nminimal burden for processing (extending inference mechanism to reduce cognitive load, compress messages, erode unneeded structures)\nminimal burden in learning (e.g. by generalization via regularity in morphology, and syntax)\nhigh accuracy for transmission of messages\nsaliencey - a information theoretic measure of more efficient transition subset of states/messages pairs.\n\nWhere the great unknown seems to be to find a minimal extension to the Lewis game in which all these might evlove.\nHaving stated the problem in detail lets me make the following two observations:\n\nThe aggregation rules for complex signaling should be made to arise by imposing costs on systems under which agents more frequently fail to make good inference with high probability of a partials message’s describing risky states for sender and or receiver.\nA second cost to fitness is the role of mistakes in signaling and or receiving. (ie. adding an small chance for decoding similar sounding signals (homophones, short vs long sounds, hissed and hushed, round, front and back vouwels). This may lead to excluding simple signals from places they might be confused, is it (a,a) (a.a) or (aa,a), (a,_,a) are avoided if signal ‘a’ is excluded from the first positions (say verb class). here dot might be a short pause, comma a long pause, undescore an unmarked slot, and two aa no pause. (either two a or a long a.) if we prefix V with v S with s and P with C\nwe end up with a system that is much more robust. And we may have the added bonus that we can easily detect a tree formation based on multiple Vprefix in the sentence….\n\nword grammar\nsub word grammar - a complex morphology - highly regular yet differented complex signals\nthis could lead to redundancy based Error correction like subject verb agreement, noun adjective agreement or vowel harmony.\nConcord - case agreement (nouns pronouns and adjective are in agreement)\n\nEase of processing\n\nagreement can also ease processing\nassimilation and elision\nlimiting processing/disabihation context windows.\nword order\nhowever redundencies add overhead, making signals longer and may make learning much longer (this is when we students who generelize are wrong and then need to learn via negative examples.\n\nIf many we have different complex signaling systems with minimal mistakes are possible one would prefer a system that is easier to learn. (Shorter lexicon, with lower chances of collision. Shorter grammar, fewer negtive examples, more room for expansion)\n\n\n\n\nwe start with some initial weights, perhaps equal.\nAn act is chosen with probability proportional to its weight.\nThe payoff gained is added to the weight for the act that was chosen,\nand the process repeats\n\n\n\n\n\nset starting weight for each option\nweights evolve by addition of rewards gotten\nprobability of choosing an alternative is proportional to its weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nset starting weight for each option\nweights evolve by addition of rewards gotten\nprobability of choosing an alternative is proportional to its weight.\nif the reward is 0 the weight is multiplied by a forgetting factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nset starting weight for each option\nweights evolve by addition of rewards gotten\nprobability of choosing an alternative is proportional to its weight.\nif the reward is 0 the weight is multiplied by a forgetting factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis is a special purpose rl algorithm for coordination problems where agents need to establish a convention like in the Lewis signaling game. The idea is that the matrix is similar to a placing 8 rooks on on a chess board with no two under attack. In this case once an option has been chosen we want to exclude all options that shares a row or a collumm.

    "text": "Making it Bayesian\nAccording to (Sutton and Barto 2018) Gitting’s index are usually associated with the Bayesian paradigm.\n\nSutton, R. S., and A. G. Barto. 2018. Reinforcement Learning, Second Edition: An Introduction. Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning Series. MIT Press. http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf.\nAs such one should be able to we could use a Bayesian updating scheme to learn expected rewards based on success counts. Since we are tracking successes vs failures we can use beta-binomial conjugate distributions to keep track of successes, failures and their likelihood.\nThis most basic form is like so:\n\n\n\nTable 1: sender & receiver prior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) sender alpha, beta\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Signal\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0,0\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n1\n0,0\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n2\n0,0\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) receiver alpha, beta\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal/Action\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0,0\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n1\n0,0\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n2\n0,0\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere we have a table of independent beta-binomial priors for each state/signal and signal/action pair.\nAfter 5 failures we update the beta distribution for the sender and receiver as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: sender alpha, beta\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Signal\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,0\n\n\n1\n0,0\n0,1\n0,0\n\n\n2\n0,0\n0,0\n0,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: receiver alpha, beta\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal/Action\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0,1\n0,0\n0,1\n\n\n1\n0,0\n0,1\n0,0\n\n\n2\n0,2\n0,0\n0,0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsender & receiver posterior\n\n\n\nFailures are outcomes of uncorrelated signal action pairs and are basically like adding noise to the distribution on the loss side. Failures here tend to have a confounding effect - they reduce the probabilities associated with reward signals. And the model is not aware of the order of rewards/failures recency.\nNow lets update for 2 success as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: sender alpha, beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Signal\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n0\n1,1\n1,2\n0,0\n\n\n1\n0,0\n0,1\n1,0\n\n\n2\n0,0\n0,0\n0,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: receiver alpha, beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal/Action\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0,1\n0,0\n0,1\n\n\n1\n1,0\n0,1\n0,0\n\n\n2\n0,2\n1,0\n0,0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsender & receiver posterior\n\n\n\nThe Rewards are for Corralated signals/action pairs. However before learning progresses signal/action pairs are picked by chance. And so if different signal/action pairs are picked for the same state we will get a synonym and consequently will be missing a state/signal pair for one of the other states which will need to be shared (homonym).\nNote that if we have a ties (between two signal/action pairs for a state then the next success or failure can be a spontaneous symmetry breaking event.\nThis will result in a a partial pooling equilibrium.\nThe Gittin’s index might help here by picking an options with the greatest expected return. If we set it up so it can recognize that a separating equilibria have the greatest expected return we should eventual learn these.\nThe problem is that micommunications (may confound the learning, until the pattern due to rewards are sufficiently reinforced.)\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nclass BayesianContextualBandit:\n    def __init__(self, n_states, n_actions):\n        self.n_states = n_states\n        self.n_actions = n_actions\n        self.alpha = np.ones((n_states, n_actions))\n        self.beta = np.ones((n_states, n_actions))\n\n    def update(self, state, action, reward):\n        if reward == 1:\n            self.alpha[state, action] += 1\n        else:\n            self.beta[state, action] += 1\n\n    def get_expected_reward(self, state, action):\n        return self.alpha[state, action] / (self.alpha[state, action] + self.beta[state, action])\n\n    def get_gittins_index(self, state, action):\n        total_reward = self.alpha[state, action]\n        total_count = self.alpha[state, action] + self.beta[state, action]\n        return total_reward / total_count + np.sqrt(2 * np.log(np.sum(self.alpha + self.beta)) / total_count)\n\n    def select_action(self, state):\n        gittins_indices = [self.get_gittins_index(state, a) for a in range(self.n_actions)]\n        return np.argmax(gittins_indices)\n\ndef sample_state(distribution, n_states):\n    if distribution == \"uniform\":\n        return np.random.randint(n_states)\n    elif distribution == \"normal\":\n        state = int(np.random.normal(loc=n_states/2, scale=n_states/6))\n        return np.clip(state, 0, n_states -

I.E. a success for a signal/action pair implies:\n\na failure for the other state/signals options with the same states for the sender.\na failure for the other signal/action options with the same signal for the receiver.\n\nIn my algorithm I went further and added the logic that a success for a signals/action pair also implies:\n\na failure for the other state/signals options with the same signal but different states for the sender.\na failure for the other signal/action options with the same action but different signals for the receiver.\n\nalso implies that the signal wasn’t available for other states.\nI’m not sure if there is a distribution that updates like that, though it isn’t that hard to implement either of the two schemes and they should work an extended beta distribution.",

[^we nay need to train the LLM on material that does not include wikipedia or to create a version that can separate wikipedia and non wikipedia material possibly using CLIP?]\n\nwith the advent of LLM we can now collect all the material in an articles Sources and use it to rewrite a more complete article and perhaps one with fewer biases.1 Further more it is fairly easy to source additional material from the web and other sources and thus again allowing a second view of the the articles point of view.\n\nAddressing vandalism and spam - this can be learned across articles\nExtracting wikidata from articles again this can be learned across many articles by mapping the article to the wikidata entries of the primary and secondary entities.\nReplace low register terms with high register terms - with an eye to improving readability. One hopes that the higher register terms are more precise and less ambiguous.\nReplace highly ambiguous terms with less ambiguous terms. The same perhaps for sentences.\nMake use of other media - diagrams, maths, code, images, videos, maps and so on should be more than referenced in the text.\n\n\n\n1 LLM inherit and amplify biases from thier training material, so this aspect is an area of active research and may require some creativity\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2024,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {LLM and the Missing Link},\n  date = {2024-09-28},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2024/2024-09-28-missing-link/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2024. “LLM and the Missing Link.” September\n28, 2024. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2024/2024-09-28-missing-link/.",

    "text": "Figure 1: Talk titled ‘Is compositionality overrated? The view from language emergence’ by Marco Baroni at the Deep Learning School on Jully 23 2030 at the Center for Brains Minds + Machines\n\n\n\nSkyrms, Brian. 2010. “14512 Complex Signals and Compositionality.” In Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580828.003.0013.\nI came across this talk during my ongoing research into complex signaling systems. My point of view is one in which extends the work in (Skyrms 2010). My notion is to discover the minimal modifications to the Lewis signaling game that lead to the emergence of complex signaling systems with various desirable properties. One thrust of my work is to consider how distributional semantics can arise in these systems. Another direction is the design or evolution of minimal grammars that supports aggregation of simple signals into complex signals.\nThe papers covered in this talk includes a paper that also discusses extensions to the Lewis signaling game and is grounded in ideas from representation learning.\nThis talk touches to some degree to some degree on the first idea and brings to bear some ideas that are similar to what I am exploring but also a number that I was unfamiliar with. I think this talk is rather vague in a number of places. However as time goes by I digested this material and updated this post I have at least been able to come up with better mental models of the notions I found elusive in this talk. I also think that some of the points made in this work don’t make much sense to me. This has led me to consider why I am unhappy with this research, identify its shortcomings and to consider how one might demonstrate these. Nit surprisingly this is a challenge. But overall it got me to focus on the direction I see most promising in this research area.\nSome criticsms of the talk are:\nNow for the long form summary…\nBaroni presents recent work by his group at Facebook Research on language emergence in deep networks, where two or more networks are trained with a communication channel to solve a task jointly.\nBaroni argues that compositionality is not a necessary condition for good generalization in neural networks and suggests that focusing on enhancing generalization directly may be more beneficial than worrying about the compositionality of emergent neural network languages.\nThis talk doesn’t provide us with an aristotelian definition of compositionality but a pragmatic one that Baroni used in investigation. His paper contains sevral more and it seems that\nThe notion of language emergence in deep networks is a fascinating if rather overloaded with vagueries. There are many and papers making grandiose claims, or making a big deal out of nothing. While Marco Baroni is a solid researcher it can be hard to tell when he is being serious, being funny or just trying to provoke thought. With these caveats in mind there are a number of results that Baroni presents that are of interest.\nIf I was initially critical of this talk and speaker I soon came to realize that this is just the kind of message that simulates thought and discussion. It is a good talk and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic of language emergence in deep networks. 👍\nIf both agents share the same classifier the frame game is a no-brainer for this task.\nIn the lewis game agents need to send N signals and recover the state from N possible options in the referential game they need to guess one of four. If the classifier is the same then there is a very good chance that the distractors are different from the signal so the agents",

    "section": "Blurb from the talk",
    "text": "Blurb from the talk\nCompositionality is the property whereby linguistic expressions that denote new composite meanings are derived by a rule-based combination of expressions denoting their parts. Linguists agree that compositionality plays a central role in natural language, accounting for its ability to express an infinite number of ideas by finite means.\n“Deep” neural networks, for all their impressive achievements, often fail to quickly generalize to unseen examples, even when the latter display a predictable composite structure with respect to examples the network is already familiar with. This has led to interest in the topic of compositionality in neural networks: can deep networks parse language compositionally? how can we make them more sensitive to compositional structure? what does “compositionality” even mean in the context of deep learning?\nI would like to address some of these questions in the context of recent work on language emergence in deep networks, in which we train two or more networks endowed with a communication channel to solve a task jointly, and study the communication code they develop. I will try to be precise about what “compositionality” mean in this context, and I will report the results of proof-of-concept and larger-scale experiments suggesting that (non-circular) compositionality is not a necessary condition for good generalization (of the kind illustrated in the figure). Moreover, I will show that often there is no reason to expect deep networks to find compositional languages more “natural” than highly entangled ones. I will conclude by suggesting that, if fast generalization is what we care about, we might as well focus directly on enhancing this property, without worrying about the compositionality of emergent neural network languages.",

We extend previous work, in which agents were trained in symbolic environments, by developing agents which are able to learn from raw pixel data, a more challenging and realistic input representation.

    "text": "Comments\nWhat are the main research questions of the paper?\n\nHow do environmental or pre-linguistic conditions affect the nature of the communication protocol that an agent learns?\nCan reinforcement learning agents successfully communicate when presented with raw pixel input, in addition to symbolic and highly structured input data?\nHow does the degree of structure in input data influence the nature of emergent communication protocols, particularly concerning the hypothesis that structured compositional language emerges when agents perceive the world as structured?\n\nLooking over this paper I did not see any outrageous claims not much that I thought wrong. Although Lazaridou has a number of criticism on research in this area this paper seems sound work.\n\nThe referential game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe referential game\n\n\n\nFirst, a speaker is presented with a target object (highlighted as CAR in the symbolic example on the left, and highlighted as the far right im- age in the pixel example on the right). Then, by making use of an alphabet consisting of primitive discrete symbols (“22”, “10”, “0”,“2”), the speaker constructs a message describing that object (“22 2 0”). We will refer to the set of all distinct messages generated by the speaker as their lexicon or protocol. Finally, the listener is presented with the target and a set of destructor objects, and—by making use of the speaker’s message—has to identify the target object from the set of candidate objects. Communicative success is defined as the correct identification of the target by the listening agent\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nAlthough the referential game isn’t a novelty and the authors give a number of prior works that use it, I do suspect that using the referential game has some possible pitfalls. Let’s consider for a second how the referential game differs from the vanilla Lewis Signaling game and if these differences should be significant.\nIn a vanilla Lewis signaling game the sender encodes the pre-linguistic object into a message and the receiver has to pick one state from all states. In this game a good sender should be able to pick a unique message per state (assuming there are sufficient1 signals and it does not make use of homonyms).\n1 for a simple system one per state is enough. For complex signaling systems this depends on how the atomic signals are aggreaged into complex ones. If the are assembled with replacement into a sequence of length k there are |S|^k complex symbols possible. If additional structure is imposed there may be less possible states. If partial sequences are allowed we may have almost twice as many states.The receiver needs to match the signal with a state. It can pick one from the undecoded states. This is initially a task with en expectation of 1/|S|. Once it solves a messages it should eliminate its states thus increase its expectation of success.\nIn the referential games I abstract to a two round extensive form game. In the first round the sender and receiver play a classification game. Sender looks at the pre-linguistic object and classifies it. It then encodes it into a sequence of symbols. The encoder has an error rate and should perform poorly as it has no pretraining.\nIn the referential game we can imagine two rounds. In the first round the agent\nLet’s assume that the sender encodes each input into a unique message or at least unique up to\nIf there are S states the\nIn the referential game the receiver need to solve a multiple choice question with one answer and several distractors by decoding the message from the sender.\nThe researchers call the language that emerges a lexicon or a protocol rather than a language or a signaling system.\n\nTo call it a lexicon is tantamount to admitting there is no grammar and that the agents are using a simple lewis signaling game. One in which they coordinate a single symbol with each pre-linguistic item or class.\n\nA complex signaling system\nOne term I don’t know if i like is pre-linguistic concepts, usually we call this as the states. However I think that this term isn’t bad at all. It suggests that we arn’t looking just at states but at an item we want to talk about. This makes more sense particularly when we think about bitmaps of states - they are less like states.\nOne more point is that by adding the vision learning we are adding a second game. Call it a classification game. The agent needs to succeed at classification game otherwise they are just guessing. It worth while to consider though that just guessing with a good memory is enough to develop a signaling system.\nThere is a massive asymmetry between the sender and the receiver that is not extant in the original game. The sender can learn all images via a ground truth while the receiver can only learn about the correct ones.\nSo that as a framing game this needs to be reconsidered. What I mean is that the sender’s vision should be evaluated compared in a scale between an agent with a perfect vision and perfect blindness as baselines. And the same for receiver.\nThe vision capability should be factored in to the evaluation of the agent’s learning of the signaling system.\nThe paper does have many interesting ideas and shows methods, for achieving them. In a number of areas I think one could do better, but I doubt the results should be very different.\nOne area that seems wort further investigation is CONCEPTUAL ALIGNMENT in appendix A. This seems to be related to semantic grounding — getting the agents language concepts/semantics to align with the world or with a second set of semantics like say a human language.\nWhat they consider here is much more specific - does the visual capacity learned by the agents provide them with a disentangled view of the world that is in line with the compositional structure of the state space they are observing (called pre-linguistic concepts).\nIt seems that either the methodology is inadequate or that there is a problem with alignment.\nWhat might be done -\n\nconsider a hierarchial model that learns just this types of relationship.\nthink more on this comparing the vision capabilities of the agent is truly fascinating.\nIt seems the crux of the matter is if the softmax layers diverge for classifying the atomic concepts and the compositional concepts?\n\nIf they do we might consider that the agents vision are not seeing things in the same way. But consider that the sender always knows the state the receivers might not know the state most of the time. So thier vision might be less developed",

    "text": "Matrix games like Prisoner’s Dilemma have guided research on social dilemmas for decades. However, they necessarily treat the choice to cooperate or defect as an atomic action. In real-world social dilemmas these choices are temporally extended. Cooperativeness is a property that applies to policies, not elementary actions. We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn policies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent learning agents, each using its own deep Qnetwork, on two Markov games we introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game. We characterize how learned behavior in each domain changes as a function of environmental factors including resource abundance. Our experiments show how conflict can emerge from competition over shared resources and shed light on how the sequential nature of real world social dilemmas affects cooperation.” – (Leibo2017marl?) abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nInitially at least it seems to me that the “sequential social dilemma” is just an analog of an iterated prisoner’s dilemma game. This game considered the basis of all other social dilemmas has been treated at great length in (Axelrod1980?) and (Axelrod1997?) with the famous Axelrod tournaments. Some interesting results include the fact that the best strategy in the tournament was the simplest. Population dynamics are such that in population of agents with one strategy, the introduction of new agents with a different strategy can gain a foothold and cause the dominant strategy in the population to switch to the new strategy. This is known as the “evolution of cooperation”.\nThis work led to a growing interest in the study of cooperation in non-cooperative games with about 300 new papers published on the topic in the 10 years following the publication.\nLater work looked at the robustness of the winning strategies in the Axelrod tournaments, see (Nowak2004?).\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn (Leibo2017marl?), the authors introduce a new class of social dilemmas, called sequential social dilemmas, which are inspired by the classic matrix game social dilemmas like the Prisoner’s Dilemma.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2024,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {Multi-Agent {Reinforcement} {Learning} in {Sequential}\n    {Social} {Dilemmas}},\n  date = {2024-06-10},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2024/2024-06-10-review-MARL-in-sequential-social-dilemmas/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2024. “Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in\nSequential Social Dilemmas.” June 10, 2024. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2024/2024-06-10-review-MARL-in-sequential-social-dilemmas/.",

    "text": "The good\nThere are a few powerful ideas in this approach.\n\nCapturing co-occurrence statistics.\n\nThe word ‘the’ is followed by a noun 50% of the time.\nCollocations may have gaps and this is where\nSkip grams generalize N-grams by allowing for gaps in the sequence.\n\nLearning from positive examples is the forte of classical language models. You can learn the regular parts of a language using such a probabilistic quite fast. Unfortunately most languages are far from regular.\nGeneralizing using smoothing - When the frequency of N-grams for some words is low enough we don’t expect to see them in a corpus of some given size. You just can’t fit all the N-grams of a given size in a corpus of a given size. but we can use shorter N-grams to estimate the probability of longer N-grams. (And this is how language models can be used to generate text). We call this process smoothing as conceptually we are filling holes in the longer N-grams probability distribution by moving some of the mass from related N-grams - to look more like the distribution of formed by combining shorter N-grams.\nLearning negative examples. With enough data we may be infer that the absence of certain trigrams in the distribution where the associated bigrams are common isn’t due to chance but due some excluding factor. They might be linguistic or perhaps censoring. Regardless to detect get to a certain confidence level say 95% we need to see lots of bigrams and no trigram. Note though that we may have some broken english or some clumsy constructions that are in our corpus - they tend to muddy the waters and render these negative examples particularly challenging to infer. In fact it is generally easier to learn more by increasing the size of the corpus and learning more from rarer positive examples and this is what LLM do. not just from the corpus but from the language. However just as children learning to generelize have to be taught that the plural of goose is geese and not gooses, learning from positive -\n\nThe problems with ngrams is that once n gets big enough and the corpus doesnt scale with it ngrams learn to model the corpus rather than the language. This is because as the ngram gets longer around the central word eventuall the contexts is specific enough that there is only one matching next ngram to for the given context - so the next word is certain.\n\nThe egg hit the wall and it broke.\n\n\nIt must be the case that the egg hit the wall and it broke right.\nUnless we are in feudal japan where internal walls are made to a large extent from rice paper on a frames.2\nWe could also be dealing with a decorative egg and a glass wall.\nOr we could be dealing with a metaphorical egg and a metaphorical wall.\n\n2 some gifted Samorai would need to catch the egg after it broke the wall to avoid they brokeIf the first scenario is correct 99.999% of the time why do we need to consider the other scenarios? The answer is best considered as a black swan problem. If we only consider the most likely scenarios we will be unprepared for the unlikely ones which could be catastrophic.\nThis suggests perhaps that while LLM should be great for learning a lexicon, a grammar, and some common sense knowledge - three very challanging tasks they are inadquate for making infrences about the world where different types of precise reasoning is required.",

    "text": "the ugly - Where are LLMs no good?\nLet’s consider an analogy from physics. Classical physics is great for predicting phenomena at macro scales but quantum mechanics is required for the micro scale.\nPhysicist like to think that quantum physics should converge to classical physics at the macro scale but this is not always the case. There are phenomena that are only explained by quantum mechanics. We may soon discover more phenomena like superconductivity, quantum computers and quantum cryptography manifsting in our macro world\nFooled by randomness….\nIn the case of LLM there is the effect of stochasticity which is built into the models. We don’t care about this aspect so long as the model gives us good replies. But all replies are inherently stochastic. While humans might express an utternce in many ways they should be able to agree on its meaning, the facts, the options, the reasoning and so on. Neural netowrks are universal function approximators and in the case of LLMs the are approximate the LM from above which are stochastic all the way down - there is no agreement excepts on the most basic probabilities. The nlp researcher can only say that an utterance is likely to be generated by the model - with some probability. Any counter claim also has some probability.The probabilities in these cases are far more dramaicaly affected by the utterance length, word choices, grammarticality, common sense knowledge then factuallity, structured knowledge\nThis is a problem because we are used to deterministic replies from humans. We are used to deterministic replies from classical language models. We are used to deterministic replies from classical AI systems.\n\nhellucinations\n\nwhere there is sparse data or the data used in training isn’t representative of the query we cannot expect the model to perform well.\neven where there is good data - if the queries are subtle enough the stochastic nature of the model will manifest.\n\nprompt engineering",

    "text": "The Ambiguity and Structure of Language\nNatural language is inherently ambiguous, and the ambiguity of small units can multiply, leading to the possibility of multiple interpretations for a single sentence. This ambiguity can be represented through parse trees, each illustrating a different interpretation. An essential aspect of these trees is their inclusion of lexical units, which are the fundamental elements of language, such as words or phrases, that carry meaning. In such cases, humans can ignore this ambiguity and focus on just one such parse.\nFor a machine, this is more challenging; it may become aware of combinatorially many trees for each sentence, and then it needs to go back and forth picking clues from this collective to eliminate serious parses. Looking and interpreting such trees can be challenging to humans who are used to surface forms. Multiple trees may have the same surface form, but most might have pathological errors in the deep structure. In reality, linguists have, over the years, come up with many formal grammars, each leading to radically different tree structures for any given sentence.",

Similarly, in linguistics, if we systematically study transformations of tree representations in a way that preserves various essential properties, such as meaning and lexical integrity, we may gain deep insights.",

    "text": "Implications for Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nThe ability to specify and conduct systematic transformation on tree representations holds great potential for data augmentation in NLP. By understanding and applying transformations that keep lexical units intact, we can generate varied linguistic data that maintains the original meaning, aiding in the development of more robust NLP models.\nMoreover, exploring transformations across languages that preserve essential functions, such as meaning, opens the door to creating machine learning (ML) systems capable of finding representations that are minimally ambiguous. This pursuit of a minimally ambiguous representation could lead to the discovery of a synthetic form that is unambiguous and easily translatable across languages.\nFor example, gender is frequently a semantically meaningless linguistic construct for whole classes of nouns. Yet natural languages use lots of resources to handle gender regardless of its vacuous nature. Certain languages use multiple variants of grammatical gender, yet others do not mark for gender and number as much as others. Are some languages more expressive - Not according to the Saphir Worph hypothesis. However, some languages are more efficient, at least in the sense of information theoretical measures, such as entropy, precision, and recall.\nAll these suggest seeking more compact alternatives.",

    "section": "Noir genre and its Constraints",
    "text": "Noir genre and its Constraints\nThe noir genre was often severely restricted by the production code, which was a set of rules that the studios had to follow to avoid censorship. This meant that the bad guys had to be punished, and the good guys had to win. This was a problem for the noir genre, which was all about the bad guys. The solution was to make the bad guys really bad, so that the audience would be happy to see them punished. This is why the villains in noir movies are often so much more evil than the villains in other genres. Noir also faced significant monetary constraints, which meant that the movies had to be made on a tight budget. The solution was to make the movies as cheaply as possible, which meant that the movies had to be set in a few locations, with a small cast of characters. Many times they used up and coming or B stars, but the writers created roles that were not just stereotypes but vehicles for the leading men and ladies to highlight thier skill. But the upshot of this was that while a few these movies were awful as the genre progressed a surprisingly large number of noir movies were made stronger due to the many artistic constraints. Many employed some really good story telling, because there was no money to cover up any mistakes. To work well the noir genre is so tightly plotted, with every scene and every line of dialogue serving a purpose. The valentine’s day massacre is no exception, it is a tightly plotted movie, with every scene and every line of dialogue serving a purpose.\nAfter the noir era ended in the late fifties we started to see neo-noir movies. These movies were often by a new generation of producers that has better budgets, talent and fewer restrictions but the best of these movies still follow the economies and kept pushing the tight plotting, dialogue and many of conventions of the noir era and relaxing them when ever the movie needed a more optimistic contrast. Familiar examples include China town (1974), Blade runner (1982), The Usual suspects (1995), L.A. Confidential (1997) Memento (2000). However neo-noir had no problem blending in more light, color and many more subtleties that let these later movies have a much wider appeal and more modern feel.",

And so all sort of people are involved in the gangster’s world but we are told one way or another how they are not innocent. This is a key theme and framing device in the movie which sets up this point of view the pre-nmovie credits which tells us the names are real and the events are real. And this point of view is reinforced by voice over introduction of characters as if their destiny is already written in stone by describing the fashion of thier death which is then contrasted with thier origins. Despite this being clearly a dramatization of the events. This moralization is in stark contrast to the portrayal of Capone in the movie.",

    "text": "Capone’s character development\nThis is a tour de force performance. We are presented with biographies of a number of gangsters. But there are only a couple that have no criminal record. These are the worst right? And Capone is one of these. Capone however is a mob boss so he does not get many chances to get his hands dirty.\nWe also get to see Scarface Al Capone. This is a tour de force performance. Here are the main scenes that Capone’s character is developed in the movie.\n\nCorporate boss Capone:\n\n\nThis is a scene full of gangsters in smart suits in an imitation of a corporate board room listening to his accountant and lawyer going over the successes of his illegitimate operations.\nCapone is busy with his own agenda - getting into the oppositions’ territory, eliminating the opposition before they can eliminate him.\nHis men try to tell him that they are tiny compared to his operation.\nCapone uses his rage to dominate and terrorize his underlings in this board room. Dispelling any notion that he is a corporate boss.\nAnd the scene cuts into a flashback of the North side gang ten car convoy’s attack on Capone’s hotel showing how his fears are very real.\nCapone then goes on to show his ruthlessness by ordering the hit on the North side gang.\nHas this become a blue print for the modern corporate boss?\nThe next scene vindicates Capone as the head of the North side gang is shown to be busy plotting against Capone.\n\n\nNext we see Capone meeting with the head of the Sicilian Mafia in Chicago. Capone treats the man with respect. He seems to be asking permission to kill Moran bau when the boos asks for a negotiation he retorts “I am not asking, … I am telling you”. Capone dominates the scene and the Mafia boss quickly agrees to Capone’s terms. Capone then warns the Mafia boss that he is in danger too. But this warning is not heeded. The Mafia boss is later killed by the North side, betrayed by the man who Capone warned him about. This is a rather weak scene, but it shows that Capone goes through the motions to pay respects the hierarchy of the Mafia, even if he is not shy to use his power to dominate them\nCelebrity millionaire capone:\n\n\nAt his mansion, he is a celebrity, he is a millionaire, and he gives interviews to the press. This Capone is smooth, charming, and most importantly charismatic. He is managing his image and is at ease in this scene.\nLater in the same mansion, we see Capone stepping out of his pool, he is taking care of his health but he looks around wearily, and we see that now he is surrounded by bodyguards, no family, no friends, no one to trust.\n\n\nCapone and His Baseball bat:\nCapone the avenging angel on the train",

    "text": "Summary\nThe paper (Team et al. 2021) explores the idea that generally capable agents can emerge from open-ended play, similar to how human children learn and develop through play. The goal is to create agents that exhibit broad competencies and adaptability without being explicitly trained for specific tasks. In other words in the typical RL settings agents are trained to perform specific tasks and can learn solution to general problems. However they are very poor at generalizing these solutions to slightly different versions of the same problem. The authors seek to develop agents that can not only learn to solve a wide range of tasks but can also generalize and transfer their solutions to new problems.\n\nTeam, Open-Ended Learning, Adam Stooke, Anuj Mahajan, C. Barros, Charlie Deck, Jakob Bauer, Jakub Sygnowski, et al. 2021. “Open-Ended Learning Leads to Generally Capable Agents.” ArXiv abs/2107.12808.\n\nEspeholt, Lasse, Hubert Soyer, Remi Munos, Karen Simonyan, Volodymir Mnih, Tom Ward, Yotam Doron, et al. 2018. “IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures.” In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).\n\nHessel, Matteo, Hubert Soyer, L. Espeholt, Wojciech M. Czarnecki, Simon Schmitt, and H. V. Hasselt. 2018. “Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning with PopArt.” ArXiv abs/1809.04474.\nThis is not the first time that this idea has been explored. Prior work includes the development of agents that can learn to play a variety of video games without explicit training on each game. Other work like (Espeholt et al. 2018) and (Hessel et al. 2018) at deep mind have already shown how this can be done. However, the authors of this paper take this idea further by developing agents that can learn to solve a wider range of tasks.\nIn this paper they develop environments that co-evolve with the agents. The environment increase in difficulty as the agents learn to solve them. The agents are equipped with intrinsic motivation mechanisms, such as curiosity and novelty-seeking behaviors, to drive exploration. A variety of tasks and challenges are presented dynamically, promoting continuous learning and adaptation.\nBut the real question is to what degree does this approach create agents that can learn to solve a wide range of tasks and can generalize their solutions to new problems. There seems to be three parts",

    "section": "Methodology:",
    "text": "Methodology:\nThe authors design an environment that encourages diverse interactions and challenges. Agents are equipped with intrinsic motivation mechanisms, such as curiosity and novelty-seeking behaviors, to drive exploration. A variety of tasks and challenges are presented dynamically, promoting continuous learning and adaptation.\nAs the authors point out - making a maze larger don’t necessarily make it more difficult once the agents have learned to solved a few mazes. The authors have to carefully design the environment to ensure that the agents are always challenged but not overwhelmed.\nI have three criticism of the methodology:\n\nAlthough this paper is about RL there is more than a fair share of evolutionary algorithms. It isn’t clear to what extent the agents are learning through RL and to what extent they are evolving through evolutionary algorithms. I don’t dislike this idea but it seems to muddy the waters regarding how well this research might be applied to create generally capable RL agents in the real world.\nSome of the environment used in testing are hand crafted while the bulk of the environments are procedurally generated.\nThe claim about these these hand crafted test environments being unlike other environments that are procedurally generated is not very convincing.\n\nHow is skill acquisition tracked?\nIntrinsic Motivations are based on curiosity and novelty seeking behaviors. However I think that for some environment/problems intrinsic (motivation) could emerge from a dynamic of the environment itself. In some way this intrinsic motivation reflects the agents ability to model the environment and to predict the consequences of its actions.\nFor example in an agent can reproduce under some selection pressure it should acquire a relevant fitness intrinsic (expected progeny). If it needs to solve different mazes it should need an exploration intrinsic. If it needs to maximize harvesting of resources it should learn some utility function intrinsic. For a social dilemma it might learn some social utility function intrinsic. However in this case this is an intrinsic that need to be learned by all agents Even if all the agents learn it there is are possibility that the agents will not cooperate. We might look to game theory, mechanism design to see if agents can learn self encouraging mechanisms to cooperate and so on. Can they learn to signal or coordinate behavior to activate the social utility function intrinsic. Can they plan to change roles in sequential games with memory and without.\na environment itself. For example in the case of the maze the agent might be intrinsically motivated to explore the maze because it is the only way to find the reward. In this case the environment itself is providing the intrinsic motivation.\nA more interesting approach would be to track the agents ability to solve a wide range of tasks and to generalize their solutions to new problems. This would be a more direct measure of the agents general capabilities.\nThe paper and website show how the internal state of the agent is visualized over the course of play. This seems to be a hearmap with different possible goals.",

Like the battle of the sexes there is no easy way to initialize the algorithm unless the agents can coordinate on a single equilibrium. If the state are unevenly distributed, or if they can listen to some prior signal, then they can coordinate on a permutation ordered by frequency for the signals and its inverse for the actions. Otherwise the agents will have to learn the equilibrium through trial and error which is the essence of the game.\nHowever the idea of a prior remained and the complexity of specifing it kept bugging me since I had failed to find a way to do it.",

    "text": "Accelarating Learning using Multiple Agents\nA second question that I had was not covered in the literature. I wanted to know if the multiple agents were signaling to each other, in a visible way, would the agents be able to coordinate on a single equilibrium significantly faster just a pair of agents.\nOne obvious point is that move by nature would slow down the process is agents are unlucky. For optimal signaling the same state would be remain until agents could coordinate and would not reoccur until the agents had coordinate on all the other states. So for multiple agents some agents would be closer to this optimum and may learn faster then the others. Secondly since matching siganl action pairs are rare, (1/k^2) for a k state game, having between k to k^2 should significantly increase Expectation of a matching signal-action pair. So this could speed things up. But this also raises the issue of differential signaling systems arising if by chance some two or more pairs learned different signal/action pairs. The learning process would need to break such ties (Skryms might call it spontaneous symmetry breaking) But it could slow down the learning process.\nActually such a state of affairs could lead to a partial pooling equilibrium, where all the agents had learned a synonym. This would be a suboptimal equilibrium, but it will provide a maximal payoff for all the agents if there are no homonyms.\nSome ideas on how to break the symmetry would be: 1. the group might defer to seniorirty i.e. the sender with the lowest id. - (takes no extra time). 1. agents could vote at random for a signal. (would take just one more step if we ignore one draw if the votes are tied) 2. ask the other agents to vote who likes signal a and who likes signal b. if the sender or reciever match the sender/reciever they like it so there would be 0 1 or 2 votes for each signal. the might be draws too and each agent would need to pick a new permutation and vote again. - (would take a few more steps) 3. the senders might pick a pair of at random untill they both pick the same one. - (would take a few more steps)\nAny way you look at it there are many advantages to consider learning by multiple senders. They seem necessary for complex signaling as well. However I was pretty certain that the analysis would keep getting more complex as we considered more options like learning grammar, contexts or a noisy environment….",

I had a fairly efficient algorithm for the learning but I wanted a better way to model the updating and the right prior. My idea of using a Multinomial-Dirichlet conjugate pair had not worked and would probably take a while to trouble shoot and fix, and it was not really the full solution I was looking for.\nMore so I was coming to terms that I could likely come up with Bayesian updating schemes that were novel and I would quickly find myself deep in uncharted territory. This had some attraction - it was not the first time I came a cross a problem that did not seem to have a conjugate prior pair to fit with prior knowledge I wanted to bring to bear in the model, but Baysian updating is just one aspect of Bayesian methodology and I was worried of getting to a dead end because of working with a new type of distributions.",

    "text": "The Model\nAt a fundamental level the Lewis signaling game of coorrdination. Sender and reciever are trying to learn a mapping between states and signals. The mappings need to be inverse of one another and to have a maximal reward the mappings need to preserve the messages - synonyms are ok by homonyms are not. And if thes number of states and signals and actions are the same then the mappings need to be one to one and onto.\nSo in such a case synonyms are not allowed and the mappings need to be not just permutation but rather cycles of length k. This is something I had understood intuitively but I had ot been very clear about.\nI was now thinking about distribution over groups - somthing I had not considered before. However it dawned on me that the two other aspects of the complex signaling game being grammar and context might be modeled additional group structures. And if we could learn cycles efficiently then we might generalize to more complex signaling systems in a reductionist way intimated in chapter 12 of (skyrms2010signals?).\nThe point is that cycles are not the simplest structure in this problem either. What we are looking at each state of Nature is a pair of transpositions that cancel each other out. A transposition is a very simple structure but it is also a base element of a permutation. The Cayley theorem tells us that any group is isomorphic to a group of permutations. If we can define our prior using transpositions then we can define a prior over permutations or general on any group.\nAnother point in favor of transpositions is that they have one operation, their composition just a product and since probabilities are multiplicative too the two seem to be a good fit.\nSo I had three point to consider.\n\nconstructing the prior for cycles based on transpositions.\nupdating the prior using based on moves in the Lewis signaling game.\nimplement it as an rl/Bayesian model say using Thompson sampling.",

A randomised communication protocol is a probability distribution over the set of possible deterministic communication protocols.\nWe can model any deterministic communication protocol as a pair of decision rees, one for the sender and one for the receiver. The sender’s decision tree maps each possible message to a signal, and the receiver’s decision tree maps each possible signal to a message.\nmessages that the sender can send. The sender samples a message from this distribution and sends it to the receiver. The receiver then uses a decoding function to map the received message back to the original signal. The goal of the game is for the sender and receiver to coordinate on a communication protocol that maximizes their payoff, which is typically based on the accuracy of message transmission and reception. It is a protocol that uses randomness to encode and decode messages.

The agents have protocols for encoding and decoding messages, and the model tracks the performance of the communication system based on the accuracy of message recovery, message length, and early recovery. This example demonstrates how to model and analyze the performance of communication systems in the presence of noise and other challenges.\nWhat we don’t have is a way to pick different protocols or to improve them over time.\nI would break this down into a few steps: 1. identify the environmental factors that would encourage the agents to evolve diverse and efficient transmission protocols. a. noisy channels b. limited bandwidth c. limited computational resources d. time constraints e. risks of predation.\n\nallow agents randomly generate candidate protocols and evaluate their performance.\n\ndef random_protocol(): # Define a random protocol for encoding/decoding return lambda msg: np.random.randint(0, 2, len(msg))",

    "text": "The Multifractal Landscape\n\n\nMandelbrot, B. B., and R. L. Hudson. 2010. The (Mis)behaviour of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward. Profile. https://books.google.co.il/books?id=zg91TAIs6bgC.\nOne of the most popular books for quants is “The (Mis)behaviour of Markets” (Mandelbrot and Hudson 2010). This is more a popular science book than a technical tome with relatively less math and some fascinating figures. The book was his last book published in 2004 and is based on lots of research. As far as I can tell the most pertinent was a paper titled Scaling in financial markets that came out in four parts just three years before the book in 2001. The papers are:\nThese are very interesting papers but like much of Mandelbrot’s work they are not easy to read. Mandelbrot was a maverick polymath whose work jumps from physicist to finance. The unifying themes are often his own innovations in fractal geometry. Mandelbrot tends to quote liberally from his earlier papers while ignoring the literature by his contemporaries. This not only annoyed many of his contemporaries, but makes these papers harder to follow. It basically Mandelbrot sets all the way down…. This is exacerbated by the fact that the papers are not easy to find and are behind paywalls or that the papers frequently avoid spelling out the models in detail like they are written for readers who are already familiar with the material.\nI have read them and will try to summarize them in a way that is more accessible. I will also try to provide some context and background to the papers and provide a few lighthearted podcasts that discuss the papers and the book.\nAlso I was interested in reproducing some of the work from the book but instead I think I can make use of some code released by others. That came out in the last few year since I read the book. The point is that these ideas can be applied to time series modeling.\nSo what are multifractals? Although multifractals are rooted in probability, much of the related literature comes from the physics and mathematics arena. Here is one definition:",

    "text": "TL-DR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper “Scaling in financial prices: III. Cartoon Brownian Motions in Multifractal Time” (Mandelbrot 2001) Mandelbrot continus his exploration of fractal and multifractal geometry to model financial price fluctuations. It introduces “cartoon” functions – simplified, visually illustrative models – to capture key characteristics of financial prices, such as continuously varying volatility, discontinuities, and extreme price changes. These cartoons, parameterized within a “phase diagram,” offer intuitive representations of various existing models, including Mandelbrot’s own earlier work and the standard Brownian motion.\nThe core concept is Brownian motion in multifractal time (BMMT), a new model that accounts for the observed complexities in financial data better than previous approaches. The paper aims to provide a more accessible understanding of BMMT, emphasizing the limitations and strengths of the cartoon approximations while highlighting the importance of scaling invariance and the concept of trading time in capturing the dynamics of financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot, B. B. 2001. “Scaling in Financial Prices: III. Cartoon Brownian Motions in Multifractal Time.” Quantitative Finance 1 (4): 427–40. https://doi.org/10.1080/713665836.\nScaling in financial prices in a nutshell\n\n\n\n\nInadequacy of traditional financial models: Classic models like the Brownian motion fail to capture the key features of financial price variations, including fluctuating volatility and large, discontinuous jumps.\nFractal and multifractal geometry for financial modeling: Mandelbrot advocates for using fractal and multifractal models to better represent the complex and volatile nature of financial markets.\nCartoon Brownian Motions in Multifractal Time (BMMT): Mandelbrot presents BMMT, a new family of random processes, as a promising model for financial prices. BMMT builds upon the concepts of fractional Brownian motion and introduces the idea of “trading time.”\nRecursive interpolation to create cartoons: The paper focuses on creating simplified, visual representations of BMMT, termed “cartoons,” using recursive interpolation techniques. These cartoons help visualize and understand the complex behaviors of BMMT.\nPhase diagram for classifying price behaviors: A “phase diagram” is introduced to map the diverse behaviors generated by these cartoons based on two key parameters. Different regions in the phase diagram correspond to different types of price variations, including Fickian, unifractal, mesofractal, and multifractal.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of standard Brownian motion: “Financial prices, such as those of securities, commodities, foreign exchange or interest rates, are largely unpredictable but one must evaluate the odds for or against some desired or feared outcomes, the most extreme being ‘ruin’. Those odds are essential to the scientist who seeks to understand the financial markets and other aspects of the economy. They must also be used as inputs for decisions concerning economic policy or institutional arrangements. To handle all those issues, the first step—but far from the last!—is to represent different prices’ variation by random processes that fit them well.” This quote highlights the need for a model that accurately reflects the inherent volatility of financial markets, which the Brownian motion fails to do.\nRecursive interpolation for financial modeling: “In the case of BMMT, the random walk has no direct counterpart. However, splendid cartoons in a very different style were developed and sketched in Mandelbrot (1997), chapter E6, and Mandelbrot (1999a), chapter N1. They are limits of discrete-parameter sequences of successive interpolations drawn on a continually refined temporal grid.” This explains the construction of simplified “cartoon” models using recursive interpolation, offering a visual and conceptual understanding of BMMT.\nThe importance of the Hölder exponent (H): “This replacement of ratios of infinitesimals by ratios of logarithms of infinitesimals is an essential innovation. It was not directed by trial and error. Neither did its early use in classical ‘fine’ mathematical analysis suggest that H and many variants thereof could become concretely meaningful, quite the contrary. H became important because of its intimate connection with certain invariances.” This passage emphasizes the significance of the Hölder exponent in capturing the scaling and self-affinity properties of financial data, which traditional methods like derivatives fail to address.\nDistinction between absence of correlation and statistical independence: “Mathematicians know that whiteness does not express statistical independence, only absence of correlation. But the temptation existed to view that distinction as mathematical nit-picking. The existence of such sharply non-Gaussian white noises proves that the hasty assimilation of spectral whiteness to independence was understandable but untenable. White spectral whiteness is highly significant for Gaussian processes, but otherwise is a weak characterization of reality.” This section debunks the misconception that uncorrelated data implies independence. Multifractal cartoons with uncorrelated increments can still exhibit significant structure and dependence.\nIntroduction of “trading time” to capture varying market speed: “Less mathematically oriented observers describe the panels at the bottom of figure 1 (both the real data and forgeries) as corresponding to markets that proceed at different ‘speeds’ at different times. This description may be very attractive but remains purely qualitative until ‘speed’ and the process that controls the variation of speed are quantified.” This introduces the concept of “trading time” as a way to quantify the subjective experience of varying market speed, a key element of the BMMT model.\n\n\n\n\n\nInability to fully predict power-law tails: The cartoons, being based on multinomial cascades, struggle to accurately represent the long-tailed distributions observed in real financial data.\nCoupling of H and multifractal time: Unlike their continuous-time counterparts, the cartoon models impose a dependence between the Hölder exponent (H) and the multifractal time.\nSingular perturbation in mesofractal cartoons: The specific construction of the mesofractal cartoons introduces an undesirable singular perturbation, highlighting a limitation of the three-interval symmetric generators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Cartoon Brownian Motions and why are they used to model financial prices?\nCartoon Brownian Motions (CBMs) are simplified, recursively generated functions designed to mimic the complex behavior of financial prices. They are called “cartoons” because they intentionally emphasize and distort certain features of real market data while remaining computationally simple and easy to visualize. These cartoons offer an intuitive way to understand the more complex model of Brownian Motion in Multifractal Time (BMMT), which is a more accurate but mathematically challenging model.\nWhat makes financial price data challenging to model, and how do CBMs address those challenges?\nFinancial price data exhibits several characteristics that defy traditional modeling approaches:\n\nContinually varying volatility: The magnitude of price fluctuations changes over time, exhibiting periods of high activity interspersed with periods of relative calm.\nDiscontinuity or concentration: Prices can jump abruptly, creating sharp spikes in price charts.\nNon-normality: Many price changes fall far outside the expectations of the bell curve, signifying fat-tailed distributions.\n\nCBMs address these features by using a recursive interpolation scheme. A simple geometric shape, called the “generator,” is used to repeatedly refine a starting trend line, producing increasingly complex patterns that capture the roughness, variability, and discontinuity observed in financial markets.\nWhat is the “phase diagram” and how does it relate to different types of CBMs?\nThe “phase diagram” is a two-dimensional map representing the space of possible CBM generators. Each point in this diagram corresponds to a unique generator shape, and different regions of the diagram give rise to distinct classes of CBMs:\n\nFickian: This corresponds to the classic Brownian Motion, where volatility is constant.\nUnifractal: These CBMs exhibit long-range dependence or persistence, meaning past price changes influence future ones.\nMesofractal: These CBMs incorporate discontinuous jumps in prices.\nMultifractal: This most general class combines features of the previous types, capturing the full complexity of financial price behavior.\n\nWhat are the key parameters controlling CBM behavior, and how do they manifest in price charts?\nCBMs are controlled by two main parameters:\n\nH (Hölder exponent): Determines the degree of roughness or smoothness of the price curve. Higher H values indicate smoother trends, while lower values indicate more jagged, volatile behavior.\nGenerator shape: Dictates the pattern of price fluctuations. Different shapes lead to varying degrees of volatility clustering, jumps, and long-term trends.\n\nWhat is “trading time” and how does it explain varying volatility in multifractal CBMs?\nTrading time is a concept used to explain the non-uniform speed at which multifractal CBMs evolve. It contrasts with the regular “clock time” of physics. Multifractal CBMs move uniformly in their own subjective trading time, which can speed up or slow down relative to clock time. This variation in speed gives rise to the observed periods of high and low volatility in financial markets.\nWhat are the limitations of using CBMs to model financial prices?\nWhile offering valuable insights, CBMs are simplifications and possess certain limitations:\n\nConstrained tail behavior: Unlike real price data, CBMs based on simple generators do not exhibit the extreme power-law tails associated with rare but significant market events.\nInterdependence of parameters: In some CBMs, the choice of H and the multifractal trading time are linked, restricting the model’s flexibility compared to continuous-time models.\nSingular perturbations: Certain mesofractal CBMs exhibit a peculiar behavior where slight changes in parameters lead to drastic changes in price patterns, which may not accurately reflect real market dynamics.\n\nHow do CBMs relate to other fractal models of financial prices?\nCBMs serve as stepping stones to understand more complex continuous-time fractal models:\n\nFractional Brownian Motion (FBM): Unifractal CBMs are simplified versions of FBM, which incorporates long-range dependence.\nLévy Stable Processes (LSP): Mesofractal CBMs relate to LSP, which features discontinuous jumps in prices.\nBrownian Motion in Multifractal Time (BMMT): This sophisticated model, for which multifractal CBMs are cartoons, combines FBM with a multifractal trading time to capture the full complexity of financial price dynamics.\n\nWhat are the practical implications of using CBMs in finance?\nCBMs, despite their limitations, offer a powerful tool for:\n\nVisualizing market complexity: They provide an intuitive way to understand and communicate the irregular and multi-scale nature of financial price behavior.\nTesting hypotheses: Their computational simplicity allows for rapid exploration of various market scenarios and model parameter sensitivity.\nDeveloping trading strategies: While not directly predictive, CBMs can inform the design of trading algorithms that are robust to varying volatility and extreme price movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of self-affinity and its relevance to financial market charts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-affinity refers to the property of a geometric shape where its parts resemble the whole when scaled differently along different axes. Financial market charts exhibit self-affinity, meaning they appear similar when zoomed in or out, with time and price scales adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nDescribe the construction process of a Fickian cartoon function using recursive interpolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe construction starts with a linear “initiator.” A three-interval “generator” replaces the initiator, creating an oscillation. Each generator interval is then recursively replaced by a scaled and potentially reflected version of the generator, continuing indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nWhy is the “square-root rule” relevant in the context of Fickian diffusion and Brownian motion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “square-root rule” states that the standard deviation of a sum of independent random variables scales with the square root of their number. In Fickian diffusion and Brownian motion, this rule manifests as the displacement of a particle being proportional to the square root of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\nDefine unifractality and explain how it differs from the Fickian case in terms of the Hölder exponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nUnifractality implies a single Hölder exponent (H) governs the scaling behavior of the function at all scales. While Fickian behavior is a specific case of unifractality with H=1/2, other values of H within 0&lt;H&lt;1 lead to different types of unifractal behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nDiscuss the concept of persistence in unifractal cartoons and its implications for market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistence describes the tendency of a function to continue its current trend. In unifractal cartoons, H&gt;1/2 signifies positive persistence, implying trends are more likely to continue. H&lt;1/2 indicates anti-persistence, implying frequent trend reversals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nHow do mesofractal cartoons incorporate price discontinuity, and what is the role of the exponent α?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMesofractal cartoons incorporate discontinuity by assigning a zero Hölder exponent (H2=0) to the middle interval of the generator. The exponent α (1/H̃) governs the distribution of jump sizes, with larger α indicating smaller and more frequent jumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nExplain the limitations of the Lévy stable exponent α exceeding 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen α&gt;2 in L-stable processes, the sum of absolute values of jumps and moves diverges, leading to unbounded variation. Upon randomization, this divergence creates infinities that cannot be renormalized away, rendering the model mathematically inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nWhat is the condition for multifractality, and how does it differ from unifractality and mesofractality?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMultifractality occurs when the Hölder exponents (Hm) associated with different generator intervals are all non-zero and distinct. This implies a multiplicity of scaling behaviors across different time scales, contrasting with the single H of unifractality and the two exponents of mesofractality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of “trading time” and its role in relating unifractal and multifractal cartoons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trading time” is a subjective time scale that maps a unifractal cartoon onto a multifractal one. It allows for varying “speeds” of price changes, accounting for the observed volatility clustering in financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nDescribe one limitation of multifractal cartoons compared to continuous-time multifractal models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMultifractal cartoons generated from a three-interval symmetric generator constrain the choice of the unifractal oscillation and the multifractal time. They cannot be chosen independently, unlike continuous-time models where they can be independent random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast the three fractal models of price variation proposed by Mandelbrot: the M 1963 model, the M 1965 model, and the M 1972/97 model. Discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to real financial data.\nExplain the “baby theorem” and its significance in understanding multifractal cartoons. How does the concept of trading time contribute to this understanding?\nDiscuss the limitations of traditional “root-mean-square” volatility as a measure of price fluctuations in the context of multifractal models. What alternative measures of volatility are more appropriate, and why?\nCritically evaluate the use of cartoons as representations of complex financial phenomena. Discuss their advantages, limitations, and the potential pitfalls of relying solely on cartoon models.\nElaborate on the concept of “spontaneous resonances” in financial markets and how multifractality might provide insights into understanding these resonances. How might this understanding contribute to improved economic policy and institutional arrangements?\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-affinity\n\nA property of a geometric shape where its parts resemble the whole when scaled differently along different axes.\n\nRecursive Interpolation\n\nA process of repeatedly subdividing and interpolating a function using a predefined “generator” shape.\n\nFickian Diffusion\n\nA type of diffusion characterized by the square-root rule, where the displacement of a particle is proportional to the square root of time.\n\nBrownian Motion\n\nA random process exhibiting continuous, erratic movement, often used to model financial price changes.\n\nHölder Exponent\n\n(H)A measure of the local scaling behavior of a function, quantifying its roughness or smoothness.\n\nUnifractality\n\nA property of a function where a single Hölder exponent governs its scaling behavior at all scales.\n\nPersistence\n\nThe tendency of a function to continue its current trend. Positive persistence indicates trends are more likely to continue, while negative persistence (anti-persistence) implies frequent trend reversals.\n\nMesofractality\n\nA property of a function exhibiting discontinuities with a specific scaling behavior governed by an exponent α.\n\nL-stable Process\n\nA type of random process with heavy-tailed distributions, characterized by the exponent α, which determines the tail behavior.\n\nMultifractality\n\nA property of a function exhibiting a range of Hölder exponents across different time scales.\n\nVolatility Clustering\n\nThe tendency of large price fluctuations to be followed by other large fluctuations, and small fluctuations to be followed by small fluctuations.\n\nTrading Time\n\nA subjective time scale that accounts for the varying “speeds” of price changes in financial markets.\n\nCompound Function\n\nA function created by composing two or more functions, where the output of one function becomes the input of another.\n\nSubordination\n\nA specific type of compounding where the inner function is a random process with independent increments.\n\nMultinomial Cascade\n\nA specific mathematical construction used to generate multifractal measures with a limited range of possible outcomes.\n\nLacunarity\n\nA measure of the distribution of gaps or holes in a fractal or multifractal structure.\n\nSingular Perturbation\n\nA mathematical concept where a small change in a parameter leads to a large and discontinuous change in the solution of a problem.\n\nDimension Anomalies\n\nDeviations from the expected relationship between fractal dimension and other properties of a fractal, often arising from complex scaling behaviors.LocalizationThe concentration of a function’s values within a specific range or region.",

    "text": "What are Cartoon Brownian Motions and why are they used to model financial prices?\nCartoon Brownian Motions (CBMs) are simplified, recursively generated functions designed to mimic the complex behavior of financial prices. They are called “cartoons” because they intentionally emphasize and distort certain features of real market data while remaining computationally simple and easy to visualize. These cartoons offer an intuitive way to understand the more complex model of Brownian Motion in Multifractal Time (BMMT), which is a more accurate but mathematically challenging model.\nWhat makes financial price data challenging to model, and how do CBMs address those challenges?\nFinancial price data exhibits several characteristics that defy traditional modeling approaches:\n\nContinually varying volatility: The magnitude of price fluctuations changes over time, exhibiting periods of high activity interspersed with periods of relative calm.\nDiscontinuity or concentration: Prices can jump abruptly, creating sharp spikes in price charts.\nNon-normality: Many price changes fall far outside the expectations of the bell curve, signifying fat-tailed distributions.\n\nCBMs address these features by using a recursive interpolation scheme. A simple geometric shape, called the “generator,” is used to repeatedly refine a starting trend line, producing increasingly complex patterns that capture the roughness, variability, and discontinuity observed in financial markets.\nWhat is the “phase diagram” and how does it relate to different types of CBMs?\nThe “phase diagram” is a two-dimensional map representing the space of possible CBM generators. Each point in this diagram corresponds to a unique generator shape, and different regions of the diagram give rise to distinct classes of CBMs:\n\nFickian: This corresponds to the classic Brownian Motion, where volatility is constant.\nUnifractal: These CBMs exhibit long-range dependence or persistence, meaning past price changes influence future ones.\nMesofractal: These CBMs incorporate discontinuous jumps in prices.\nMultifractal: This most general class combines features of the previous types, capturing the full complexity of financial price behavior.\n\nWhat are the key parameters controlling CBM behavior, and how do they manifest in price charts?\nCBMs are controlled by two main parameters:\n\nH (Hölder exponent): Determines the degree of roughness or smoothness of the price curve. Higher H values indicate smoother trends, while lower values indicate more jagged, volatile behavior.\nGenerator shape: Dictates the pattern of price fluctuations. Different shapes lead to varying degrees of volatility clustering, jumps, and long-term trends.\n\nWhat is “trading time” and how does it explain varying volatility in multifractal CBMs?\nTrading time is a concept used to explain the non-uniform speed at which multifractal CBMs evolve. It contrasts with the regular “clock time” of physics. Multifractal CBMs move uniformly in their own subjective trading time, which can speed up or slow down relative to clock time. This variation in speed gives rise to the observed periods of high and low volatility in financial markets.\nWhat are the limitations of using CBMs to model financial prices?\nWhile offering valuable insights, CBMs are simplifications and possess certain limitations:\n\nConstrained tail behavior: Unlike real price data, CBMs based on simple generators do not exhibit the extreme power-law tails associated with rare but significant market events.\nInterdependence of parameters: In some CBMs, the choice of H and the multifractal trading time are linked, restricting the model’s flexibility compared to continuous-time models.\nSingular perturbations: Certain mesofractal CBMs exhibit a peculiar behavior where slight changes in parameters lead to drastic changes in price patterns, which may not accurately reflect real market dynamics.\n\nHow do CBMs relate to other fractal models of financial prices?\nCBMs serve as stepping stones to understand more complex continuous-time fractal models:\n\nFractional Brownian Motion (FBM): Unifractal CBMs are simplified versions of FBM, which incorporates long-range dependence.\nLévy Stable Processes (LSP): Mesofractal CBMs relate to LSP, which features discontinuous jumps in prices.\nBrownian Motion in Multifractal Time (BMMT): This sophisticated model, for which multifractal CBMs are cartoons, combines FBM with a multifractal trading time to capture the full complexity of financial price dynamics.\n\nWhat are the practical implications of using CBMs in finance?\nCBMs, despite their limitations, offer a powerful tool for:\n\nVisualizing market complexity: They provide an intuitive way to understand and communicate the irregular and multi-scale nature of financial price behavior.\nTesting hypotheses: Their computational simplicity allows for rapid exploration of various market scenarios and model parameter sensitivity.\nDeveloping trading strategies: While not directly predictive, CBMs can inform the design of trading algorithms that are robust to varying volatility and extreme price movements.",

    "text": "Instructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of self-affinity and its relevance to financial market charts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-affinity refers to the property of a geometric shape where its parts resemble the whole when scaled differently along different axes. Financial market charts exhibit self-affinity, meaning they appear similar when zoomed in or out, with time and price scales adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nDescribe the construction process of a Fickian cartoon function using recursive interpolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe construction starts with a linear “initiator.” A three-interval “generator” replaces the initiator, creating an oscillation. Each generator interval is then recursively replaced by a scaled and potentially reflected version of the generator, continuing indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nWhy is the “square-root rule” relevant in the context of Fickian diffusion and Brownian motion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “square-root rule” states that the standard deviation of a sum of independent random variables scales with the square root of their number. In Fickian diffusion and Brownian motion, this rule manifests as the displacement of a particle being proportional to the square root of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\nDefine unifractality and explain how it differs from the Fickian case in terms of the Hölder exponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nUnifractality implies a single Hölder exponent (H) governs the scaling behavior of the function at all scales. While Fickian behavior is a specific case of unifractality with H=1/2, other values of H within 0&lt;H&lt;1 lead to different types of unifractal behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nDiscuss the concept of persistence in unifractal cartoons and its implications for market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistence describes the tendency of a function to continue its current trend. In unifractal cartoons, H&gt;1/2 signifies positive persistence, implying trends are more likely to continue. H&lt;1/2 indicates anti-persistence, implying frequent trend reversals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nHow do mesofractal cartoons incorporate price discontinuity, and what is the role of the exponent α?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMesofractal cartoons incorporate discontinuity by assigning a zero Hölder exponent (H2=0) to the middle interval of the generator. The exponent α (1/H̃) governs the distribution of jump sizes, with larger α indicating smaller and more frequent jumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nExplain the limitations of the Lévy stable exponent α exceeding 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen α&gt;2 in L-stable processes, the sum of absolute values of jumps and moves diverges, leading to unbounded variation. Upon randomization, this divergence creates infinities that cannot be renormalized away, rendering the model mathematically inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nWhat is the condition for multifractality, and how does it differ from unifractality and mesofractality?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMultifractality occurs when the Hölder exponents (Hm) associated with different generator intervals are all non-zero and distinct. This implies a multiplicity of scaling behaviors across different time scales, contrasting with the single H of unifractality and the two exponents of mesofractality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of “trading time” and its role in relating unifractal and multifractal cartoons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trading time” is a subjective time scale that maps a unifractal cartoon onto a multifractal one. It allows for varying “speeds” of price changes, accounting for the observed volatility clustering in financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nDescribe one limitation of multifractal cartoons compared to continuous-time multifractal models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMultifractal cartoons generated from a three-interval symmetric generator constrain the choice of the unifractal oscillation and the multifractal time. They cannot be chosen independently, unlike continuous-time models where they can be independent random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast the three fractal models of price variation proposed by Mandelbrot: the M 1963 model, the M 1965 model, and the M 1972/97 model. Discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to real financial data.\nExplain the “baby theorem” and its significance in understanding multifractal cartoons. How does the concept of trading time contribute to this understanding?\nDiscuss the limitations of traditional “root-mean-square” volatility as a measure of price fluctuations in the context of multifractal models. What alternative measures of volatility are more appropriate, and why?\nCritically evaluate the use of cartoons as representations of complex financial phenomena. Discuss their advantages, limitations, and the potential pitfalls of relying solely on cartoon models.\nElaborate on the concept of “spontaneous resonances” in financial markets and how multifractality might provide insights into understanding these resonances. How might this understanding contribute to improved economic policy and institutional arrangements?\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-affinity\n\nA property of a geometric shape where its parts resemble the whole when scaled differently along different axes.\n\nRecursive Interpolation\n\nA process of repeatedly subdividing and interpolating a function using a predefined “generator” shape.\n\nFickian Diffusion\n\nA type of diffusion characterized by the square-root rule, where the displacement of a particle is proportional to the square root of time.\n\nBrownian Motion\n\nA random process exhibiting continuous, erratic movement, often used to model financial price changes.\n\nHölder Exponent\n\n(H)A measure of the local scaling behavior of a function, quantifying its roughness or smoothness.\n\nUnifractality\n\nA property of a function where a single Hölder exponent governs its scaling behavior at all scales.\n\nPersistence\n\nThe tendency of a function to continue its current trend. Positive persistence indicates trends are more likely to continue, while negative persistence (anti-persistence) implies frequent trend reversals.\n\nMesofractality\n\nA property of a function exhibiting discontinuities with a specific scaling behavior governed by an exponent α.\n\nL-stable Process\n\nA type of random process with heavy-tailed distributions, characterized by the exponent α, which determines the tail behavior.\n\nMultifractality\n\nA property of a function exhibiting a range of Hölder exponents across different time scales.\n\nVolatility Clustering\n\nThe tendency of large price fluctuations to be followed by other large fluctuations, and small fluctuations to be followed by small fluctuations.\n\nTrading Time\n\nA subjective time scale that accounts for the varying “speeds” of price changes in financial markets.\n\nCompound Function\n\nA function created by composing two or more functions, where the output of one function becomes the input of another.\n\nSubordination\n\nA specific type of compounding where the inner function is a random process with independent increments.\n\nMultinomial Cascade\n\nA specific mathematical construction used to generate multifractal measures with a limited range of possible outcomes.\n\nLacunarity\n\nA measure of the distribution of gaps or holes in a fractal or multifractal structure.\n\nSingular Perturbation\n\nA mathematical concept where a small change in a parameter leads to a large and discontinuous change in the solution of a problem.\n\nDimension Anomalies\n\nDeviations from the expected relationship between fractal dimension and other properties of a fractal, often arising from complex scaling behaviors.LocalizationThe concentration of a function’s values within a specific range or region.",

    "text": "A list of RL-papers and resources that I have read or plan to read.\nI think that RL is fascinating and I have been reading a lot about it recently.\nMy approach to the book is is reductionist. I try and break down the algorithms into their innovating parts and then try and understand the parts. This seems a good fit to the book and courses that I took.\nHowever, in papers the authors are trying to present their work in the best light. They typically present lost of references to other work, which seem like new ideas to all but the most expert reader. They also present lots of ideas, which are not actually realized in the paper. The reality is that most papers in the end are about one new innovation.\nI recently made a time line of the RL and bandit algorithms that I had learned. This was an interesting exercise and I got to see that indeed one a new idea is introduced it is quickly picked up by other researchers who try to apply it to other problems, other algorithms, or different settings. There are many setting in RL and as Adam White explains in “Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning” it is best to understand new ideas in the simplest setting possible.\nThe main thrusts of RL seem to be\nHowever a second circle of ideas is covered in the course and book. These too are worth listing here. If only to create a checklist of things to consider when implementing an RL system or coming up with a new algorithm.\nHinton’s in his course and in (Nowlan and Hinton 1992) at paper describes his approach where by initilizing neural networks with zero values this in effect creates a network that that can grow in capacity as it learns. This can continue until all the weights are non-zero.\nTwo other ideas - weight sharing and sparsity inducing penalties and constraints can also be used to control the capacity of the network.\nThis idea is also of some interest to RL where different function approximation methods use neural networks to approximate value functions, V,Q or the policy pi. Modle based methods also use neural networks to approximate the model of the environment which typicaly is a state transition function M(s’|a,s) and a reward function R(s’|a,s) though a four part dynamics model can also be used p(s’,r|a,s).\nA central issue is that that when approximating these on continuous state the functions treat regions of the state space as equivalent. This can creates generalization when states are very similar (same state, highly correlated or have high mutual information) But so long as the function approximator fails to distinguish between states that are very different there will be a problem. The above ideas on controlling the capacity of the network could be used to allow the capacity of the network to grow as the agent learns thus perhaps allowing coarse features to be learned first and then more fine grained features to be learned later.\nWe see that this dependence between states is a breaking point to translating algorithms for tabular methods to setting with function approximation.\nthe V,Q functions are approximated by neural networks. In the course Adam White describes how the capacity of the network. In the course Adam White describes how the capacity of the network can be controlled by the number of hidden units in the network.\nHe also discuses how we can slow this down by using a sparsity inducing penalty. These are L1 and L2 regularizations terms on the weights.\nAs I recall weights and gradients in neural networks get smaller as the network gets deeper. This is because the gradients are multiplied by the weights in the backpropagation algorithm. This can lead to the vanishing gradient problem. One way to solve this is to use a sparsity inducing penalty on the weights. This can be done by adding a term to the loss function that encourages the weights to be zero. This is a form of regularization that is different from the L1 and L2 regularization that we have seen before.\nBut today I was thinking that we might use a per layers multiplier on the weights so as to rescale the weights and their gradients. This could improve numerical stability and help to avoid the vanishing gradient problem.\nencourage them to be zero. This is a form of regularization that is different from\nthere are about 42 papers that are covered in the course.\nSome papers",

But each scenario can have a different setting.\n\n\n\n\nlewis signaling game\n\n\nIn The book signals (Skyrms 2010) the author, Skryms, discusses how Lewis challenged the skepticism of his advisor Quine regarding the meaning and convention may arise via an arbitrary mechanism like symmetry breaking.\nWhen I considered solving some additional issues surrounding the fundamentals of signaling systems I realized that I had a few different scenarios in mind and that writing them down with some semblance of formalism might be helpful. It turns out that indeed this turns out to be a stepping stone towards developing an optimal algorithms for learning signaling system in different rl settings.\nLet’s face it under different settings the task of acquiring a signaling system can be easier or harder. In (Skyrms 2010) the author points out that at symmetry breaking all the different signaling systems that could be learned are equivalent. However if there is an asymmetry in the form of a non-uniform distribution of states or different signaling risks then we we might prefer some signaling systems over others and there might even be a unique optimal signaling system. Furthermore like in reality one would expect that with time distributions of states might change and the optimal signaling system might change as well.\n\nSkyrms, Brian. 2010. “14512 Complex Signals and Compositionality.” In Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information.

    "text": "1. The Oracle of Saliency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: The Oracle of Saliency\n\n\n\nSender and Receivers consult an “Oracle” (perhaps in book form). The oracle tells them how to map states to action, the oracle provides the sender with a one to one mapping of states to actions and to the receiver with the transpose, a mapping of signals to actions. The sender and receiver can then use this information to infer the signaling system.\n\n\nIn many situation where agents share some experience or can consult the same oracle they can infer the same signaling system and avoid the cost of lengthy coordination required to reach a common signaling system. This is the easiest case and the most likely scenario for the evolution of signaling systems.\nTwo cases come to mind.\n\nThey have booth been observing the state space long enough to infer the distribution of states to a high degree of confidence. \nThey can listen to a third party who knows the distribution and learn to signal from them. \nThey can access a state classifier and send it random noise thus deriving an empirical distribution of states in the classifier (not nature) and use it to learn the signaling system. \n\ncoordinate via the state distributioncoordinate by imitationcoordinate via a classifierOnce a distribution of states in known it can be used to create huffman codes using 0 and 1. These signals are then ranked.\nThere is a distribution of the states of the word known to all players.\n\nIn the easiest case each state has a different probability of occurring. -It is easiest because all players can infer a canonical signal system from such a distribution of states.\n\nThey order states and corresponding actions in decreasing expected value. The canonical system is the one mapping between the states and the actions.\nThus the salience distribution breaks the symmetry of all viable signaling systems and leaves just one option.1\n\nIn each subsequently harder case there are two or more states with equal probability of occurring. These probabilistic symmetry of these states cannot be broken as before and require the use of coordination. The coordinators can break the symmetry by trial and error when that state arises. Once all the symmetries have been coordinated the players can infer the rest via the canonical signal system from the distribution of states.\nIn the worst case all states have equal probability of occurring. This is the hardest case because after each state signal pair the problem is still maximally symmetric. The players need to solve this by using trial and error.\n\n1 This is notion of a most salient mapping acts as an optimal policy for agents who need to quickly avoid the long run costs of a non salient signaling system\n\n\n\n\n\nMARL Formulation\n\n\n\nIn terms of the MARL formulation:\n\nA PMDP has states S and actions A.\n\nStates are observed by agents of type S whose actions are signals\nActions are performed by agents of type R.\nRewards are assigned symmetrically to both All senders and receivers when the receiver action matches the sender observed state.\n\nStates can be uniformly distributed or be drawn from a distribution.\nWe like to call such a distribution the saliency distribution after Schelling notion of a focal point AKA (Schelling point) in his book The Strategy of Conflict. In a lewis signaling game there are n! signaling systems if there are n states, signals and actions. If the states are uniformly distributed then all signaling systems are equivalent. But if the states probabilities are monotonicaly distributed then there is a unique optimal signaling system which is precisely the Schelling point.\nSince saliency",

    "text": "2. Learning the Saliency distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: Creation of the Oracle of Bayes\n\n\n\nIn another tribe where agents are too busy with their routine to coordinate on a signaling system. But they vigilantly observing and tallied thier environment. all the agents sooner or later will record the same empirical distribution of states. Whenever a state’s probability emerges into ‘significance’ it becomes common knowledge which allows all to order it along with the others and to enumerate with its ‘canonical’ signal. As the states’s distribution evolves over time so does the signaling system.\n\n\nAnother point is to consider that if agents just observe states long enough they should eventually learn to approximate the state distribution. How long would this take ?\nIf there least common state has probability \\alpha and the agents want to know the distribution with confidence \\epsilon they would need, according to Hoeffding’s Inequality\nK\\ge\\frac{log(2/\\epsilon)}{2\\alpha^2} \\qquad \\text{(samples to learn S)}\nalso recall that although there is no lower bound on \\alpha when S\\sim Uniform[N] the upper bound is 1/N\nK\\ge\\frac{N^2log(2/\\epsilon)}{2} \\qquad \\text{(samples to learn uniform S)}\n\n\nCode\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK = 8 # states\nepsilon = 0.34 # confidence\n\n\n# Calculate time to learn the saliency distribution \n# N using the formula N &gt;= (K^2 * log(2 / epsilon)) / 2\nN = (K**2 * math.log(2 / epsilon)) / 2\nprint(f'Expected time {int(N)} to learn a {K} state distribution with confidence {epsilon}')  \n\n# Expected time to learn a signaling system with N states\n\nT = K * math.log(K)\nprint(f'Expected time {int(T)} to learn a {K} signaling system  ')\n\n\nExpected time 56 to learn a 8 state distribution with confidence 0.34\nExpected time 16 to learn a 8 signaling system  \n\n\nSo learning a signaling systems is easier then learning the distribution of states. Once they they know how to signal states it is easy to use this system to communicate the distribution to all the receivers.\nWe have not put a cost on learning the signaling system. But if there was a cost associated with learning we could use it to model when agents would prefer to learn the signaling system or just wait until they can infer the distribution of states and infer they systems from that.\n\nA third point is that if they are bayesian they could start to infer the signaling system after viewing a few stats and update thier system as they update their beliefs regarding the distribution of states.\n\n\nBringing Up Baby\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: Bringing Up Baby\n\n\n\nHere the sender is tha parent and the receiver the child. Each time the child learn a new action a new signal is added to the signaling system. Since the other signals are known the child can learn the new signal in a single step. This is another trivial case where learning is easy.\n\n\n\n\nHoppes Urn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental Learning\n\n\n\nIn RL this is called incremental learning. We can also assign such signals to sequences of actions which we call capabilities. The child can learn a new capability in a single step. This is the most efficient way to learn a signaling system incrementally.\n\n\nSkryms discusses two methods that agents can use to learn a signaling system incrementally. First is the Chinese restaurant process and the second is the Hoppe urn. He suggest that they are equivalent. I too came up with the Hoppe urn model - as I had already investigated how to codify the most common probability distributions as urn models.\nAnother way to make learning easier is to always have just one action in context when we need to learn. This allows the receiver to learn the signal system in a single step. It might work with a student learning to signal and act in tandem.incremental learning with one new action\nIn this case urn used in learning have an Hoppe urn with a black stone indicating that a new state action pair is being learned. If the receiver learns the new signal action pair, the agents keep track of it otherwise the new signal and action are discarded.\nNote that if the there is only one new state and action a suitable algorithm can learn it immediately. IF there is an exploration - this may cause an error.\nWe retain this mechanism and might use it for expanding a signaling systems incrementally in the presence of new data.\nNote: if there are saliency distributions is being used a new signal would be the last signal in the saliency distribution or in the last group. Over time signals that are not in use might be discarded if thier saliency is bellow the minimum saliency threshold.",

    "section": "The evolution of signaling systems",
    "text": "The evolution of signaling systems\nIn this section I want to address some of the questions that drive my research on signaling systems.\n\nWhen do we expect signaling systems to evolve?\nWhen agents fitness is increasingly predicated on coordination or communication they will get a benefit for evolving signaling systems. I.e. a evolutionary pressure to communicate will lead to the evolution of signaling systems.\n\n\nWhat are the main desiderata for signaling systems?\n\nHere are some of the main desiderata for signaling systems:\n\nEfficiency - the signaling system should be as short as possible.\nSalience - the signaling system should be most salient for the distribution of states.\nCost - the signaling system should be as cheap as possible to learn and use.\nRobustness - the signaling system should be robust to noise and deception.\nAdaptability - the signaling system should be able to adapt to changes in the distribution of states.\nCompositionality - the signaling system should be able to be combined with other RL activities to form\n\nmore complex signaling system.\nmore complex policies.\n\n\nThis is most clearly illustrated in:\n\nThe predation scenario where\n\nAgent’s short term survival is predicated on their ability to respond to signals indicating the presence of predators by take the appropriate precautions. Of course signals need a source.\nAgents can send a signals for the state they perceive or to stay mute.\nAgents can repeat signals they receive or stay mute.\nAs predation increases, selection pressure may induce signaling systems to evolve.\n\nThe Dowery/Courtship scenario where:\n\nThe game can be cooperative or competitive.\n\nIn the competitive case only the fittest agents get a mate.\nIn the cooperative case all agents get to mate but some will mate more often, or with more desirable mates.\n\n\nAgent must collect resources (e.g. a bill of goods for a dowery) before they can reproducing from a changing landscape.\nOnly the top n dowries will generate an offspring. (bills of goods slowly perish but the size and diversity of is important).\nAlternatively only the agent that is the the best at courtship n times can generate an offspring. (this time there are smaller bills of good that quickly perish)\nResources are plentiful but evanescent.\nAgent that can signal would be able to collect a dowery faster and increase thier fitness.\nAs competition increases benefits signaling systems should evolve.\nThis is interesting as the exploration/exploitation dilemma caps the rate at which agents can reproduce. Yet signaling will allow agents to over come this cap.\nThis is also a case where agents may get a benefit from sending false signals if the receiver is a serious contender. So that the receiver will waste time and resources.\nThe agents must learn to discriminate To handle deception agents may also develop a model of the mind of the sender to predict the likelihood of deception. They may also want to tally if the sender has been deceptive in the past.\nOr\n\nThe Knights & Knaves scenario where:\n\nAgents need to:\n\nClassify agent by type. (knight or knave, monkey, insane, etc.) to interpret the semantics of their signals.\nAssemble the state from messages with different semantics to recover the state of the world.\n\nThis scenario does assumes the agents have an underlying motivation to learn to signal.\nAnd now add a selection pressure on the evolution of basic logic and semantics.\n\n\nAgents that communicate can spend less time exploring and more time exploiting. . In this case the agents will evolve a signaling system that is most salient for the distribution of states. This is the most likely scenario for the evolution of signaling systems. The reason why agents might want to learn a signaling system is to maximize their fitness\n\nWhat are the main parameters that affect the learning of signaling systems?\n\nstate distribution (these are the states of the world and signaling is used to share these states with others to maximize fitness - the expected progeny)\nsaliency distribution (weights for states ranking thier risk)\nvoracity of senders.\ncost of signaling (risk of predation).\n\nWhat are the different settings for learning signaling systems?\n\nSome other questions within these contexts might be:\n\nWhat are the number of signaling systems for a given number of states and actions?\nWhat are the number of pooling equilibria for a given number of states and actions?\n\nLet’s break these down by the degeneracy of the pooling equilibrium. This might suggest the minimal number of signals needed in an experiment to learn the signaling system. It might also suggest the thresholds of success for optimal signaling systems in different settings.\n\nCan we estimate the regret for different RL algorithms ?\n\nWhat is the expected signaling success for each of the above?\nWhat is the expected and the mean number of steps to acquire a signaling system for a given number of states and actions under different settings?\n\nHow does having more senders or receivers affect the above?\n\nWhat is the complexity of n-agents to come up with a common signaling system?\n\nunder full communication\nunder partial communication\n\n\nHow does locality affect the time to a universal signaling systems?\n\nif there is full observability\nif communications are one to one\nif communication are different neighborhood, Von Neuman, Moore, hexagonal, other lattices, chains, rings, random graphs. (need to use optimal dynamics)\n\n\nAnother question that like a lemma on time needed for an agent to become experienced enough to setup an optimal signaling system?\n\nGiven distribution S of states with k states and some the rarest state s' having probability p(s') = \\alpha what is the expected number of observations needed for agents to approximate the distribution of states to within some credible interval \\epsilon&lt;\\alpha?\nNote while there is no lower bound on alpha the upper bound is \\alpha = 1/k for a uniform distribution of states. I think this is the Bayesian version of an empirical distribution. This would be a waiting time for becoming experienced.\nAfter this waiting time a steady state distribution should be known to all agents.\n\nUnder partial observability the agents need to cooperate to learn the signaling system in a distributed manner. If the agents are on a grid or on a graph what are the bounds on coordination time for learning the signaling system - using a gossip protocol - i.e. each agent can only communicate with its neighbors - using a broadcast protocol - i.e. each agent can communicate with all other agents - using a random walk protocol - i.e. each agent can communicate with a random agent - using a central coordinator - i.e. each agent can communicate with a central coordinator - using an ambassador - i.e. each agent can communicate with an ambassador who can communicate with many other agents per Ramzey’s theory\nWhile reviewing a paper of this subject I had realized that there are a number of hypothetical scenarios for signaling systems to arise.\nIn RL we have different setting for learning optimal strategies. Some of theres different scenarios can be framed in this form.\nI wanted to list them here so I can reference them later\nBut thinking as I list these I notice that some provide an easy solutions to problems that others don’t.\nOne point of interest. If the agents are concerned with picking the right action for each state, they should collapse any states which share the same optimal action into a single signal. This will reduce the number of signals they must be learned and reduce the overall message length and cost of signaling. So in reality we should not be overly concerned with the number of actions exceeding the number of states.\nWhen there are not enough signals agent need to learn to aggregate signals.\nadd\n\nlearning by evolution:\n\nreplicator dynamics with\nagents have random signaling systems assigned and the systems with most payoffs is selected through population dynamics.\nchildren learn thier parent matrix via sampling.\n\none parent (perfect and imperfect transmission)\ntwo parents\n\npidgins via shared dictionaries\ncreoles shared grammars and dictionaries\nadding some mutation - adding mutations to the childrerns signaling system.\nbased on paper by (Nowak and Krakauer)\n\nlearning via reinforcement learning\n\nspontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios vs planning\n\nIf there are N signals, states and actions is there an advantage to planning a signaling system vs letting it evolve in terms of the number of steps needed to learn the signaling system?\n\n\nrandom signaling means that each step is an independent trial.\nSender can send N signals and\nReceiver can guess N Actions\nSo there are N^2 combinations per turn.\nSo there are Only the ones with A=T get a reward so there are N good combinations. So there is a N/N^2 = 1/N chance of getting a reward. So we can expect that the number of steps needed to learn to signal the state T is N.\nplanning means that the sender picks one signal and sticks to it. In this case Receiver gets to systematicaly eliminate an action every time.\nsender has 1 signal and\nreceiver can guess N at first and N-1 at second and N-k-1 at kth turn.\nSo there are n+1/2\nactions giving 1*N combinations and only ones with A=T get the payoff. So there is a 1/N chance of getting a reward. So we can expect that the number of steps needed to learn to signal the state T is N.\nThus planning is faster than random signaling.\nrandom signaling means that there are (2n/n*n)^n = 2\nis agent use positive reinforcement only then\n\n\nare there conditions where the signaler/reciever gets to detrmines the signaling system?\n\n\nif Sender sends random signals from L-{coordinated} R must guess the state From L-{coordinated}.\nif S wants to switch X and Y ? and does so R get 0 . If R is epsilon greedy he will find the new semantics.\nA meta protocol would require a code switching signal be “Swap X Y”\n\nSource coding scenario errors in encoding & decoding - based on paper by (Nowak and Krakauer)\nerrors in the transmission channel based on paper by (Nowak and Krakauer)\nrisks - there are signals with monotonically increasing risk.\n\npayoffs for signals are symmetric\ncost associated with the risky signals are borne by the sender\nif receivers can respond correctly after getting a partial message they get a bonus.\nwe can also consider sharing cost and rewards symmetrically. — creating a complex system with compositionality using self play\n\n\n\n\nThe Bayesian view of the signaling systems\nIn this section let’s consider a view of the Lewis signaling game in terms of a bayesian game theory. This is a perspective I used in a article on planning in the complex signaling game and helped me think more precisely about the how a signaling system might evolve in a formal setting.\nThe game has n states and n signals. Internality the a the agents will learn a permutation of the states and signals and its inversion. So there are n! signaling systems that can be learned. In the world of bayesian agents each such permutation characterizes an agent type. THe game starts by nature picking a type for the agent. I say this this is because the agent needs to define a strategy which is a response for each state! Now the same is true for the receiver. The receiver’s strategy is to pick an action for each signal. After that it can use bayesian updating to update it’s belief about the type of the sender. These probabilities can guide it in the process of learning the signaling system. As the pair make progress, the receiver is able to update it’s belief about the sender’s type, discarding options that are inconsistent with the signals it has received! Once it has finds n-1 signals it can be certain about the sender’s type and it will have an expected payoff of 1.",

    "section": "Framing games and evolution of domain specific languages",
    "text": "Framing games and evolution of domain specific languages\nIn this scenario we considers if learning a shared language could be a game changer in some strategic interaction like a social dilemma. We may ask be able to not only interpret different signaling system as embodying different semantics derived from the framing game but also consider if these create linguistic relativism where that agent’s languages shapes thier perception of the framing game by allowing them to develop newer strategies. We can also consider the beginning of ethics in such a system by considering if the introduction of language allows increases or decreases the overall welfare of the agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: Framing Games\n\n\n\nAgents tasked with maximizing a reward signal under conditions of strategic interaction. We call this the framing game and it might be as simple as a 2x2 matrix game like the battle of the sexes, a social language like the iterated prisoner’s dilemma or as complex as a Sugarscape simulation . At some point, perhaps at the start send and received actions are introduced into the agents action space. They can now assume the role of the sender and receiver in a Lewis Signaling game.\nIf the incentives are right e.g. the framing game is cooperative they could learn to signal to each other. Note though that it is conceivable that agents could learn to signal if they are in a competitive game if they are sufficiently driven to explore the send and receive actions. However the resulting equilibrium might not be a perfectly separating one if the agents are not suitably incentivize to use the language to coordinate.\nFurthermore these signals may then be incorporated into the planning and allow the agents to coordinate on the framing game.\nOne expects that the language that arises under such circumstance would be limited to the domain of the framing game and that its semantics would be inherited from the framing game. However larger framing games with many generation of agents might lead to dynamics that lead to the emergence of a more general language.\n\n\nThis kind of scenario actually contains a rich set of paths to the emergence of many different languages. For agents in the lifelong settings the emergent language might gain additional strata of semantics from multiple domain and then evolve to a more general language.\nA questions then arises what simple framing games can lead to agents to develop languages that are imbued with sufficiently rich semantics that the language has the Sapir-Worf property of being able to express semantics from any other language.\nAnother idea I have been using liberally in my thinking is that of a framing game for the lewis signaling game. This idea comes from the field of Multi agent Reinforcement learning however it should also be valid in terms of Game theory.\nSimply put an agent may be tasked some general problem like playing chess or solving a maze. In the past I worked on wizards that configure servers or home networks for telecoms.\nI could envision an RL agent learning to do these job by learning from experience. However it seems that if it can play a lewis game and learn a signaling system that is a subset of english that approximate its domain then it can chat with people rather then relay on a some user interface.\nFor a home networks it might need a smaller subset of english and for a server configuration it might larger one. What seems to be the point is that the agent tasked with some external task might be able to learn a signaling system that has semantics inherited from the task. If such task is a strategic interaction we may view it as a game. And together we can view the framing game and the lewis signaling game as single iterated game in which the agent learns to play a new variant of the framing game in which it has access to a coordination mechanism that is a domain specific language.\nI think that we if we naively combine a game like the battle of the sexes a pure coordination problem with the lewis signaling game the agents will learn a language like ‘football’, ‘opera’. And that these can arise within three iterations and allow the agents to then coordinate on the battle of the sexes so as to score the highest payoffs. This could happen both if the agents alternate signaling or one always gets to signal first, and always picks opera.\nOn the other hand with iterated prisoners dilemma signaling might not make a difference as the language may not be able to change the payoffs sufficiently to make the agents act any differently. In this case it is entirely possible that a signaling system will not arise at all regardless of what the agents say they will act in their own best interest. This leads to a completely pooling equilibrium.\nSo the question that comes to mind is this - 1. can we setup up the signaling game so that the agents will always learn a signaling system if coordination is a benefit. 2. How can we encode the signaling system so that its prelinguistic object will be the states of the world and the actions of the agents. I.e. we want them to be able to talk about the outcomes of the framing game in the signaling game. 3. We want cost and benefits of signaling to be decoupled from the framing game - i.e. we may deduct the payoff for signaling success once the signaling system is learned. 4. We do want the agents in the framing game to aware of the outcome of the signaling game. 5. Finally we want to identify if there are strategies in which coordination increase of decrease overall welfare.\ne.g. in the battle of the sexes we should expect perfect rewards e.g. in a three way traffic junction game we might expect the agents to signal thier intentions to turn left or right and to go straight. This would allow them to avoid accidents. One such mechanism might be a game of paper rock scissors to determine the priority of the agents. e.g. in the Braess’s Paradox establishment a high way though a city we might end up increasing the traffic jams.",

IT can start with in jokes, invented words and phrases and co-opting the meaning of existing words to mean something else. This is a form of co-adaption where the language and the society co-evolve. If allowed to evolve the language can drift so that a stranger would be at odds to understand what the speakers are saying and this is called semantic drift.\nFor RL agents it is possible for them to develop a language that is unique to them as suggested above. It is also possible that as conditions change e.g. the framing game is switched from Battle of the sexes to Prisoner’s dilemma the languages will remain a 4 state 4 signal language but the meaning of the signals will drift.\n\n\nthis story is more about something we might want to avoid.\n\nhaving more agents should reduce co-adaption.\nSemantic drift is inherent in the evolution of language. However we may want to allow the language to evolve but for certain aspects to remain fixed. This is one of the desiderata for emergent languages. What we would prefer that grammar and much of to be stable over multiple generation so that great grandfathers can still communicate with thier great grand children. Why is this a problem? In agentic systems we design language emergence to be fast. In most cases every agents need to learn it from scratch, they enjoy the benefits of perfect recall and a noiseless channel. This also means that languages might change very quickly to and that we as researchers will have a tough time understanding the agents over the course of thier simulation. However in natural languages we have a similar situation and for language to work for large populations and for record to make sense for thousands of years we want much of the language to be stable with possiblies for evolution at the fringes….\nHow do we ensure semantics persist over time ? We call this is the idea of grounding. Imagine all the most important ideas were written down in a book and that book was passed down from generation to generation. Everyone might need to learn the book a little after they learned basic language skill in school. soon the book becomes cannon and no one may change it. Over time though it might be permitted to add bits when new concepts were discovered and proved important enough to preserve.\nShort of starting a religion for our agents we may want good mechanism that will keep the language grounded so that cooadaption and semantic drift are kept in check.\nAnother point here is that if our agents are aware that the framing game has been swapped from battle of the sexes to Prisoners dilemma that they may want to keep their semantics for the Battle of the sexes intact and use them as a template or prior for the Prisoners dilemma. Since prisoners dilemma is non-cooperative, there may not even be a perfectly separating equilibrium for framing game so that assigning a language from a template prior might actually be of benefit. .",

    "text": "As I progressed though the RL specialization I came to realize that the research is mostly about coming up with a new algorithm that works better. This is tricky and so in many cases what happens is that people end up considering some narrow setting better yet is it is new and so they can publish a paper claiming novelty. On the other hand almost all algorithms revolve around a rather small set of techniques. One might call these techniques ‘magic tricks’ to avoid the fact that they are also grounded in computer science and mathematics. Some researches show thier algorithms converge better.\nOutside academia RL is a tool. We don’t have quick simulators but we do have challenging examples. I notice that most people use a few algorithms rather than coding thier own from scratch. This makes a lot of sense if out problem is very similar to other problems that the algorithm has been tested on. But what if our problem is different? We can try a bunch of algorithms and see which one works best. But what if they are mediocre?\nAnother approach which I consider continuing the approach espoused in (CiationNeeded?) The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena and (CiationNeeded?) Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos.\nI imagine a research algorithm that has all these tricks available in a modular way and that can adaptively reconfigure itself to the problem at hand.\nAnd one more thing it would then expose its hyperparameters to be tuned by Optuna or some other hyperparameter optimization tool….\nAll this power suggest the one ring to rule them all so perhaps this might be the master algorithm.\nMagical Tricks:",

Although I’m no Maimonides, I will assay to identify the different meanings; delineate thier contextual boundaries; and to establish a hierarchy relating such different facets of Compositionality.\nIn this research note I’m trying to formalize the notion of compositionality within the context of Lewis signaling games. Though I’m hopeful to try to extend this to Multi Objective Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MO-MARL) with applications to transfer learning. I will also try to abstract these into a formalize mathematical form.\nIdeally, though I’d like to express these using commutative diagrams and functors.

    "section": "Motivation 1 - Synthetic and Emergent languages",
    "text": "Motivation 1 - Synthetic and Emergent languages\nWhen dealing with emergent languages, I believe that complex signaling systems that are more faithful representations of real world states are superior to ones that just map them arbitrarily. I say complex because the simple signaling systems are highly symmetrical but when we use aggregate signals we immediately get systems that are have different levels of desirable properties. The signaling systems one ends up with may be path dependent, and may not be the most optimal for the task at hand.\nBut what does it mean to be faithful? 1\n1 this is not related to the mathematical notion of a group action discussed below, It just means that the signal is a good representation of the state.We can most easily understand it using an example. If the state contain some space time description, a signaling system that has a rule about describing space and similar rule about time will require learning two rules and a much smaller lexicon rather than leaning no rules and a massive lexicon for each of the space time combinations deemed pertinent to communication. We also see how compositionality is intimately tied to learnability and faithfulness. In a language that is compositional we can allocate more of the lexicon to atomic and semantically orthogonal concepts and use the rules to create a whole space of possible meaning.\nWhy is this a challenge? In the real world states are complex and there are many facets to being faithful. For example, the state might be a picture of a cat. The signaling system might have to learn to describe the color of the cat, the shape of the cat, the size of the cat, the position of the cat, the orientation of the cat, the texture of the cat, the breed of the cat, the mood of the cat, the age of the cat, the health. The list goes on and on. So as a language grows we shift from a simple rules to capture parts of the state into more abstract system that can capture all the many facets of the state with the added constraint that this abstract system must be easy to learn via this same idea of composition. 2\n2 One would imagine that given a flexible template for a complex signaling game the constraint on learnability would select for more compositional languages. In reality there are many impediments to learning such a systems so there are no guarantees that using various constraints will lead to a paragon of complex signaling to emerge - we will more likely see something odd and obscure that is very hard to interpret. I’d like to point out that natural languages are rather hard for machines to learn and for most humans even more so.\nDesiderata fulfilled by the original Lewis signaling game\nNatural language temper a using faithful one to one mapping with of state to signals with abstraction that are easier to learn by being general.\n\nWhen learning using a Lewis signaling game, agents begin with a very simple semantic setup\nthere is a list of states and we want to be able to name them.\nAgents learn a mapping not unlike a lexicon which list the different meaning of a token.\nA good lexicon also lists things like prefixes, suffixes and collocations which are compositional elements of language.\nA thesaurus list synonyms which are also compositional elements of language. Lewis games can also capture synonymy by having multiple signals for the same state we can call these partial pooling states equilibria - separating equilibria as they do not require receiver to guess the state from the signal. While synonyms are clearly inefficient in a a signaling system, when adding a time dimensions synonyms for common ideas can diverge into more nuanced states as we learn more facets of the partial state they correspond. We can think of this also as X+w_1 a, X+w_2 b ... X+n where X is the common state and a, b, … n are the different semantics atoms but the weights w_i start as 0 and slowly increase thus diverging into more meaningful versions.\nLewis games can also capture homonymy by having multiple states for the same signal this is called a partial pooling equilibrium. These are useful if we consider them as the most informative partial signals that can be sent. (This may sound a bit of a stretch but it is best way I found to think about it.)\n\nWe can see how Lewis game can capture at least three structural properties of language. In the literature the focus has been on signaling systems which are one to one mappings between states and signals this corresponds to a large part of language which is unambiguous and has a list like structure I discussed above. However we can now see that algorithms that could be designed to target a broader set of equilibria that facilitate use of synonyms and homonyms. This is a more complex signaling system that is more like a thesaurus and a dictionary combined.",

    "text": "Motivation 2 - Transfer learning in RL\nSome modern RL algorithms are fantastic for finding optimal or superhuman level policies for a single task. However, when we want to learn a new task we often have to start from scratch. This is because the policy is a complex function that is hard to decompose into simpler functions that can be reused. This is a problem of compositionality. If we could decompose the policy into simpler functions we could reuse the simpler functions and learn the new task faster. This is the idea behind transfer learning.\nRecent research into using LLMs with RL agents indicates that with an expressive enough language and the kind of common sense knowledge captured in such a language agents may have enough structure to represent thier task in terms of an abstraction that is sufficiently amenable to transfer skills between task and may significantly reduce the amount of learning required to learn a new task. So if a language is a compositional representation of the world and the rewards can also be expressed as compositional functions of the state components then agents may be able to leverage these structures.\nAlso learning language in the microcosm of other games framing the lewis signaling might be key to exploring this duality of RL algorithms that learn abstract representations along with transferable RL skills.",

    "text": "Games and constraints\nBesides the lewis signaling game there are:\n\nthe Lewis reconstruction game - where the receiver needs to reconstruct the state (an image) using the signal and there is a reconstruction loss. The agents get a shared reward but it is not 0 or 1 but a continuous value. (Deep learning practitioners likes continuous rewards since they can be differentiated and plugged into the backpropagation algorithm.)\nthe Lewis referential game AKA the classification game. The receiver needs to pick the correct state from a set of distractions and one or more good image. This is easier than the original game as there are fewer states to choose from. However selecting the state requires learning an image classifier or even a clip classifier and this is a harder task then just learning a mapping from states to signals. (It requires more steps to train if we start from scratch and learn one example at a time as we do in the lewis game. In this game i think if the distractions come from a GAN there would be better opportunities for compositionality to emerge.)\nThe set reference game (Mu and Goodman 2022) in which states are sets of images that need a rule\nThe concept game (Mu and Goodman 2022)\n\nNote: in both these task there are usually two modalities. Perception with multiple modalities may be key to developing the discriminative ability to learn to ignore distractions and focus on the most salient parts of the state. Each modality has its own distractions and noise. This places the actors language expressive enough to be general purpose. On the other hand the real world is four dimensional. A large parts of languages like tenses and part of the case systems are about capturing these. Anyhow if we can get an adversarial setup ideally the adversary can learn to generate distraction in all modalities.\nA four dimensional world is a world where the state is a sequence of three dimensional attributes that evolve. Some are salient to one task others to another and most are distractions and should be ignored. Also in this kind of a game agents can more readily learn to distinguish between cheap talk and informative signals. This is because distractions are not just random noise but are generated by a model that is trying to fool the receiver.",

    "text": "Functors abstractions of function composition\nIn mathematics composition of function is one of their most fundamental and useful properties. When we think about compositionality in natural language and in machine learning we are really trying to impose some version of this idea into the problem and this is a point we almost always forget. But since mathematics is where this ideas are formalized, mathematics is where the some of the best ideas are likely to be found.\nIn mathematics one is often more interested in functions that preserve a structure which are called morphisms. and the abstraction of this idea is functor in category theory)\n\n\n\n\nfunctor\n\nHowever lewis games do not require us to only use simple symbols. Agents can play the game with more complex signals and states. This is where the notion of compositionality becomes more interstsing. We can think of the lewis game as a function from states to signals\n\nformal languages deal with transformation of one set of symbols to another set of symbols. This lets us rewrite a message from basic symbols into one with more complex symbols and allows us to use numbers to represent the different languages in the chomsky hierarchy. This is probably not the first thing that people in this field consider. However work starting with the simple formalism of Lewis game quickly raises the questions of how can we get language in which subsequent signals can used to break the symmetry leading to ambiguities associated with partial pooling equilibria. This is it worth noting as it might be the necessary abstraction to properly state the the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chomsky hierarchy expresses greater expressivity.\n\n\ngames have a tree representation called extensive form.\n\nWe can graft to the lewis game tree additional trees states before and after and thus get game with equilibria that are more in line with various notions of compositionality and other properties of natural languages.\nIf this seems extreme it is worth noting most of the time we are not interested in a coordination task but some other framing task in which coordination is a means to an end. If this task can be learned by MARL then we already have this kind of extended tree with an embedded lewis game tree. It is essential that some kind of harmony is maintained between the parts or the equilibira may not be part of the biggger game. e.g. lewis games are cooperative games where the agents are trying to coordinate on a single equilibrium. If the framing game is a zero sum game it then it may eliminate the incentive to coordinate encoded into the payoffs of the lewis game. I don’t mean to say you cant have a game with incentives to cooperate and to compete but that when you do its a subtle ballance to maintain both without breaking either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsyntax tree\n\n\nsignals can be aggregated using different ways and it is hard to generelize from conjunction, to recursive structures.\n\n\nThe syntax of English, for example, is clearly compositional—that is, the meaning of a sentence is some function of the meanings of the parts of that sentence. — (Kirby 2001)\n\nKirby, Simon. 2001. “Spontaneous Evolution of Linguistic Structure-an Iterated Learning Model of the Emergence of Regularity and Irregularity.” IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation 5 (2): 102–10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot (Gold)\nTense (Red)\nPerson & Number (Green)\nGroup Action\n\n\n\n\náll\nPresent\n1st person singular\nállok\n\n\náll\nPresent\n1st person plural\nállunk\n\n\náll\nPresent\n2nd person singular\nállsz\n\n\náll\nPresent\n2nd person plural\nálltok\n\n\náll\nPresent\n3rd person singular\náll\n\n\náll\nPresent\n3rd person plural\nállnak\n\n\náll\nPast\n1st person singular\nálltam\n\n\náll\nPast\n1st person plural\nálltunk\n\n\náll\nPast\n3rd person singular\nállt\n\n\náll\nPast\n3rd person plural\nálltak\n\n\náll\nFuture\n1st person singular\nfogok állni\n\n\náll\nFuture\n1st person plural\nfogunk állni\n\n\náll\nFuture\n2nd person singular\nfogsz állni\n\n\náll\nFuture\n2nd person plural\nfogtok állni\n\n\náll\nFuture\n3rd person singular\nfog állni\n\n\náll\nFuture\n3rd person plural\nfognak állni\n\n\n\n\nthis is considered a regular verb in hungarian\ni have ommitted many of the forms of the verb for simplicity\nwe can ser that person and number have an entangled representation.\npresent tense is unmarked\npast tense is is an infix\nfuture tense has its own template with a auxilary verb and a infinitive\nthere is another point I’d like to make and it has to do with making agent able to communicate with humans.\nif the agent’s language has the same group actions (homomorphism) to express structural semantics of nouns, verbs, pronouns etc. It should be much easier to then learn to converse in the homomorphic human language. The task boils down to learning functors that map agentic-roots to natural roots and agentic rules to natural rules. The agentic language might be highly regular with a single verb template and to use hungarian it might need to learn 60+ verb templates. But this is much easier I think then learning hungarian from scratch.\nin reality learning a few extra rules might faccilitate (e.g. phonemic adjustments and vowel harmony) being able to communicae with hungarian verbs.\n\nNote though that we are no longer talking about learning hungarian but some underlying structure that is shared between hungarian and the agents language.\nThis idea of learning a underlying structure and a surface structure is one that can be further abstracted. We can have a morphological level a syntactical level and a logical level all disentandled and seperatable or we can have them all sitting in one level and possibly entagled.\nEntaglement can arrise from … cancatenation, from coding the most common segements into shorter segments, erosion, and swapping to help with difficult phone sequences.\nTHis suggests that we might have a sequence-bag or soft-sequence agregator - a conventino that has a prefered order but is indifferent to change in the order so long as semantics are preserved.\nalso word order\nşehirlileştiremediklerimizdensiniz mean “you are one of those that we could not make into a city dweller” in archaic turkish. The word order is the opposite of English or Hebrew, this is because Turkish is a VO and English is an OV language.

I am thinking of normal subgroups.\nNote that we can define the metric on the parts and aggregate them to get the metric on the whole. This is a form of compositionality.\nMore abstractly we can just say that the state is an algebraic topological group.\nSo the language designer can use a template with n part (on for each of the subgroups) Ideally ordered with by the decreasing size to prefix code the sub-states. If they there are duplicate sizes this will yield multiple equilibria to be selected via spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nThe designer now can allocate the states to one of the points in the topology. By picking the system with lowest overall distances we get a regular compositional language.\nSince there are many ways to do this the designer needs to coordinate with the receiver.

    "text": "There is an e-commerce store. Every day it collects the cost, sales and shelf price for each product. Let’s say we also have to deduct a sales tax or value added tax say at 17% which we can calculate as  VAT = price * .17  At the end of the day the profits for a product is  \\text{profit} = ( \\text{shelf price} - \\text{cost} - VAT ) \\times \\text{units}  | date |uid |price|cost|units| |———-|—-|—–|—-|—–| |2022-01-01|123 |20.0 |12.0|125.0| |2022-01-02|123 |20.0 |12.0|115.0| |2022-01-03|123 |26.0 |12.0|105.0| |2022-01-04|123 |26.0 |12.0|95.0 | |2022-01-05|123 |30.0 |12.0|80.0 | |2022-01-05|123 |30.0 |12.0|80.0 | ## The task What we want is to recommend a price that will maximize profit. Since we can set any price the main problem we have is that we we never have a full picture of the demand there is always some uncertainty. ## The probabilistic formulation Let’s make this more precise. Demand seems a function of prices. Historical Prices have a historical distribution: each price appears for N day and we can aggregate : | shelf_price | tot_day | | — |— | | 20.00 usd | 12 | | 25.00 usd | 10 | | 30.00 usd | 8 | If we and we normalize by the total days we will have a discrete probability. Let’s also consider additional prices (which the store’s policy requires to be even numbers)\nWe can use the above table to create a distribution of demand of a product at different prices. Next we want to look at demand which is a bit more complicated. We can start again simple and estimate the probability of each level of demand | demand (Q) | tot_day | P(Q) | | ———–:|——–:|—–:| | 120 | 12 | 12/30| | 100 | 10 | 10/30| | 80 | 8 | 8/30| we could use the mean daily units for each price | price | \\bar{Q} |p(price\\mid Q)|P(Q)|p(Q\\mid P)\n|——:|——-:|—–:|——:|:————-:| | 20.00 | 120 | 12/30| 12/30 | ? | | 26.00 | 100 | 10/30| 10/30 | ? | | 30.00 | 80 | 8/30| 8/30 | ? | Bayes formula tells us how to get P(Q|P), the distribution of demand given the price by inverting the distribution of price give demand.\np(Q|price) = \\frac { p(\\text{price} \\mid Q) \\times p(\\text{Q})}{p(\\text{price})}",

    "text": "Issue 1 - Aggregation induced co-linearity in all our data distributions\nSince we have used the mean demand per price all the marginal probabilities lined up by the days and are the same. (We introduced a correlation between P and Q ) Can we do it all without aggregation ? - The calculation of P(price) in the price distribution remains the same. p(price) = \\frac{1}{days_{tot}} \\sum day_{p}  - The calculation of P(Q) is\np(demand) = \\frac{1}{days_{tot}} \\sum day_{q}  Since we look at Q instead of \\bar{Q} we will end up with more levels of demand and. We may even have some levels of demand corresponding to different prices. So while one would expect there to still be a correlation between P and Q it is not a deterministic relationship anymore. - The last quantity we need to look at is P(P|Q) P(Q) = p(price|q) = \\frac{1}{days_{tot}}\\sum_\\Omega \\delta(P=\\text{price},Q=q)  - Where \\omega just means sum over all events - and delta is Kroneker’s delta function  delta(i,j) = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{ll}\n       1 & \\text{if} & i=j \\\\\n       0 & \\text{if} & i\\ne j\n   \\end{array}\n    \\right.  which is shorthand for sum over all cases where random variable Price (P) takes value price (p) and random variable demand (Q) takes value q so again we just count how many days each price quantity combo appeared. Note: if our site changed prices hourly we could sum over hours. The term before the sum just normalizes the event probabilities so they sum up to one. ## Greaat Expectations - Estimating profit using probability We have estimated p(Q|P), is out work done? well we can use it to estimate the profit (\\Pi) using  \\Pi(\\text{price}) = ( \\text{price} - \\text{cost} - \\text{VAT} ) \\times \\mathbb{E}(q|\\text{price})  - Where we replaced historical unit with expected units conditioned on a price. - Recall that the same levels of demand may correspond to different price level and that we set the price. - Recall that expetion of a random variable \\mathbb{E}(X=x) is defined as  E(X=x) = p(X=x)*x  so in this case  \\Pi(\\text{price}) = ( \\text{price} - \\text{cost} - \\text{VAT} ) \\times p(Q=q|P=\\text{price}) \\times q  ## Optimizing profits using probability So we have an probabilistic model, a fancy name for our conditional distribution, which we can use for estimating profit. Once so we have estimated the \\Pi profit at every price we can pick the best ane we are done. ## A date with destiny - introducing uncertainty Well no quite, while our model is probably great at summarizing the past but as Yogi Berra pointed out “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” Our knowledge even of the past is far from complete. Talking with colleagues about our data we learn that. - Some of the products are brand new and have no data yet - There are many prices we haven’t tested\n- How sure are we that the samples we collected are good. - Some products only sell a unit once per month. - Daily demand varies stochastically. - Conditions in the market for December are expected to be different from November due to holidays. - Conditions in the market for next quarters are expected to be different from the previous month due to macroeconomic reasons. - Some products have a narrow price foot print and others have wider ones. - The last manager picked some bad prices which angered some client. Other prices made them happy but precipitated losses resulting in a summery dismissed.\nIt seems like there are some some risk factors when it comes to mistikes in pricing and we should look at mitigating these. We can start by quantifying uncertainty. Some of the factors above we may be able to mitigate. We should have known unknowns and try to stir from unknown unknowns. It seems we may be able to do better if we at leWhat we may want to do is use our Once we have collected some data can model future profit. Since we set the self price the only unknown in our little chart is the the corresponding level of demand for the product. We can also estimate the relation of demand and price using a regression with the following formula  Q = a_0 + P^\\eta  where: - Q is demand - a_0 is the marginal demand - P is the price - \\eta is the elasticity of demand  \\text{profit} = ( \\text{shelf price} - \\text{cost} - VAT ) \\times (a_0+P^\\eta) \nwhich means that if our model is good we can estimate profits for",

    "text": "Transfer learning in NLP\n\n\nTransfer learning is the ability to reuse knowledge learned in one domain to another.\n\nConvergence\nIf we got a LEC (large enough corpus) say we got all the english transcription of the data collected by the NSA for a year. That should give a fairly comprehensive view the language.\nSupposing we have a smaller data sets could we use statistical methods to predict how well the semantics or grammar etc in that corpus converge to the LEC.\nI call this notion the convergence to an ideal language models. And I recon that these datasets will converge fairly well as most language speakers should be able to understand them almost perfectly.\n\n\nDivergence\nOn the other hand there is also a second related notion of divergence. This is something we notice in NLP when we use a dataset from a different domain for an unrelated task and it fails abysmally.\nThis divergence is due to there being difference in how the language is being used even if it is still easy to understand. For most people spoken language AKA Sassure’s ‘Parole’ is a much smaller subset of the vocabulary and other construct they can understand collectively which might understand AKA ‘Langue’. and while the two may be convergent they have a quantifiable divergence. Quantifiable in the sense that the probabilities or perplexities of a sentence form a different corpus would be somewhat different for a word model approximating each corpus.\n\n\nA Transfer Function\nSuppose we had a good langue models for different substrates of a language than one would suppose it should be possible to generate a function to translate from one to the the other. This function would take an utterance from one, capture its meaning and find the most likely form it should take under the second model.\nIn deep learning one might create such a function by\n\npre-training on one corpus and then freezing most of the layers and training on the second corpus.\ncreating a encoder decoder pair for each and using one to model to encode and the other decode.\n\nThe idea of there being a convergent\n\nHow can we qualify and quantify the difference between different datasets/language models drawn from a newspaper/encyclopedic/technical papers/novels/tweets/forums/transcribed radio shows/ conversational language.\n\ndifferent words\nword probabilities\nsimilar words (replaceable words)\nrelated words (word affinity)\nsemantics\n\ntop word sense per lexeme\nword sense distribution per lexeme\n\nn-gram probabilities.\ndifference in the grammar.\n\nmean length of sentence.\nmean complexity of vocabulary.\nco-reference frequency.\nuse of pronouns and wh-words.\nother constructs\nquestions\nuse of affect, sarcasm\n\netc\n\nSuppose we had could characterize all these moderately well using a number of covariance matrices and distributions or even HMM.\nCould we use a KL distribution to simulate one from the other.\nCould we build a transformer to translate one into the other.\nHow would we test/evaluate these.\n\nTest case:\nHebrew/English movie subtitles\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2021,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {Transfer Learning in {NLP}},\n  date = {2021-08-13},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2021/2021-08-18-transfer-learning-nlp/2021-08-18-transfer-learning-nlp.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2021. “Transfer Learning in NLP.” August 13,\n2021. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2021/2021-08-18-transfer-learning-nlp/2021-08-18-transfer-learning-nlp.html.",

    "title": "WaveNet Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The WaveNet paper is a few years old. But it seems to come up in various contexts - mostly in the area of sound synthesis. It was the first paper to do waveform generation directly from a neural net instead of modeling vocoder parameters, used an innovative convolutional net technique and to top it all is an autoregressive model which was some years before probabilistic neural networks were being used. Here is some info on it and some follow up papers. (Perhaps I’ll split them up later.)\n\nWaveNet\nIs a fully probabilistic and autoregressive CNN model for the for TTS synthesis task. At this point CNN were mostly used for Image processing and RNN which are much harder to train were used for Sequence to Sequence modeling. The main WaveNet innovation is that it was a CNN that could handle contexts over lone term sequences (it needed to handle 16,000 samples per second over serval second).\nWaveNet It was based on the PixelCNN van den Oord, Aaron, Kalchbrenner, Nal, and Kavukcuoglu, Koray Pixel recurrent neural networks 2016 van den Oord, Aaron, Kalchbrenner, Nal, Vinyals, Oriol, Espeholt, Lasse, Graves, Alex, and Kavukcuoglu, Koray. Conditional image generation with PixelCNN decoders 2016 architecture. To handle long-range temporal dependencies needed for raw audio generation, the authors developed a new architectures based on dilated causal convolutions, which exhibit very large receptive fields.\nWaveNet is unique in its ability to synthesize sound directly where previous models required additional steps. Later TTS systems utilise WaveNet as a component, tweaking the joint language model with the linguistic context representations.\nTypical TTS pipelines have two parts: 1. text_analysis(text sequence) - \\implies sentence segmentation - \\implies word segmentation - \\implies Text normalization - \\implies POS tagging - \\implies grapheme to phoneme conversion - \\implies phoneme sequence + linguistic contexts. 2. Speech synthesis(output) - \\implies synthesized speech waveform. - prosody prediction - speech waveform generation\nThe two main approaches for the speech synthesis part are:\n\nnon-parametric example-based AKA concatenative speech synthesis due to Moulines & Charpentier, 1990; Sagisaka et al.,1992; Hunt & Black, 1996 which builds up the utterance from units of recorded speech.\nparametric, model-based AKA statistical parametric speech synthesis due to (Yoshimura, 2002; Zen et al., 2009). which uses a generative model to synthesize the speech. The statistical parametric approach first extracts a sequence of vocoder parameters (Dudley, 1939) o = {o_1, ... , o_N } from speech signals x = {x_1, ... , x_T } and linguistic features l from the text W, where N and T correspond to the numbers of vocoder parameter vectors and speech signals.\n\nTypically a vocoder parameter vector o_n is extracted at every 5 ms. It often includes:\n- `cepstra` [[Imai & Furuichi, 1988]() or       `line spectral pairs` [Itakura, 1975]() which represent vocal tract transfer function.\n- `fundamental frequency` $F_0$ and `aperiodicity` [Kawahara et al., 2001](), which represent characteristics of vocal source excitation signals. \nThen a set of generative models, such as a HMM Yoshimura, 2002, feed-forward neural network Zen et al., 2013; RNN Tuerk & Robinson, 1993; Karaali et al., 1997; Fan et al., 2014, is trained from the extracted vocoder parameters and linguistic features.\n\n\nResources\n\npaper WAVENET: A GENERATIVE MODEL FOR RAW AUDIO\nblogpost: wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio\n2 minute papers coverage: WaveNet by Google DeepMind | Two Minute Papers #93\nDigital Marketing Competitor Analysis: Guide to Evaluating Competition\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2021,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {WaveNet {Review}},\n  date = {2021-08-29},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2021/2021-09-08-wave-net-review/2021-09-08-wave-net-review.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2021. “WaveNet Review.” August 29, 2021. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2021/2021-09-08-wave-net-review/2021-09-08-wave-net-review.html.",

I had noticed that the issues like coverage and repetition were anathema to summarization from its inception. When I looked for more information I found the following video which together with a review paper can provide a good intro to this subject. I also found links to the papers mentioned and extracted some of their abstracts. I have to admit that looking at all the algorithms critically I found some new ideas for tackling problems, beyond what I had come up with on my own.\n\nNotes from the following lecture by Masa Nekic given at NDC Conferences.\nThe talk provides:\n\na starter ontology.\na review of algorithms.\nsome evaluation methods\nsome tools.\n\nGiven time, I may add data set and review of more modern literature since seq2seq RNN model.",

The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components. The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts.

The approach taken is to integrate the parser with the rest of the system. This enables the parser to benefit from predictions that the rest of the system makes in the course of its processing. These predictions can be invaluable as guides to the parser in such difficult problem areas as resolving referents and selecting meanings of ambiguous words. A program, called FRUMP for Fast Reading Understanding and Memory Program, employs this approach to parsing. FRUMP skims articles rather than reading them for detail. The program works on the relatively unconstrained domain of news articles. It routinely understands stories it has never before seen. The program’s success is largely due to its radically different approach to parsing.\n\n\nMy insights:\nThis approach has two interesting ideas.\n\nKR using templates or frames.\nKR using scripts is even more powerful method.\n\n\nA modern take on this might involve using a classifier to identify sentences as\n\nFacts\n\ngeneral knowledge (simple)\ndomain knowledge (complex or technical)\n\nOpinions\n\ngeneral knowledge (similar to many documents)\ndomain expert.

We test the technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents. Salience is typically defined in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in first place in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set including data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous LexRank. We also show that our approach is quite insensitive to the noise in the data that may result from an imperfect topical clustering of documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlexrank graph\n\nIdea:\nsimilar to page rank where pages vote for each other:\n\nCreate an adjacency matrix using cosine similarity.\nRepresenting sentences as nodes in the graph\nConnecting nodes based on inter-sentence cosine similarity matrix\nuses eigenvector centrality from this matrix.\nthe sentence with the highest rank would be linked to many other important sentences. Are they very similar or not ?\na threshold is used to determine how many connected components should are used.\n\n\nmy insights:\n\nAlgorithmically lexrank is a more sophisticated way of clustering like the MEAD algorithm. According to the paper, lexrank performed better.\nGraph algorithms are computationally expensive for large graphs. This could mean that the approach would not scale.\nTo build the matrix they used a cosine similarity - but on using words. Replacing words with their embeddings should yield even better results with lower costs.\nThere are a number of centrality measures on graphs. A high eigenvector score means that a node is connected to many nodes who themselves have high scores. The paper looked at Degree, LexRank with threshold, and continuous LexRank. This is clearly a place where one may be able to do better.\nTfiDf is another way to rank concepts.\na problem is that the underlying assumptions for creating the graphical models are difficult to justify. Building a graph from web pages using links seems natural while constructing a graph using similarity between sentences perhaps in different documents seems contrived. Sentences may capture several concepts and arguments may span several sentences. Similar sentences may have very different meaning and different sentences may have the same meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseq2seq",

    "text": "The big reversal\nSome time back an analyst of an enterprise client asked me to look at their account and figure out if a recently launched service was a success or a failure. I had expected this call a while back. I had written the measurement plan after consulting with the system analyst then since the dev team had allocated three hours for implementing the document I was asked to help and implement it using a tag Managment solution and used the allocated three hours to verify all the edge cases. At this point the marketing department got an invoice and decided their budget was running low, as they had ended up paying for the dev teams oversight, and told me to postpone the reporting indefinitely. The ops did a blue green launch and then a full launch and then lots of data started coming in.\nAfter a few months of data collection the analyst looked at the data and saw lots of abandoned sessions. The measurement plan was of little help, instead of a 50 page presentation I had provided a long page of strangely named virtual pages referencing a two UML charts they had sent me. The plan had been one of the simplest I had turned out and the trick had been choosing just the right names. The fact that the service had many exit points and only three entry points was not helpful and that success could reset or terminate the sessions early. The terms marketing sieve or anti funnel come to mind. It was real difficult to see if end users were reaching a goal or giving up in transit. Reporting would have managed the aggregation of the data using a number of clever regular expressions and some more to allow one to drill down into the different modules. The analyst could not see almost any successful sessions. The problem was a second more complex service was now being finalized and Marketing needed to present the previous project to the CEO as part of a quarterly meeting.\nSo I used GA To find the results manually, I saved massive url and their screenshots to permit reproducing the analysis at a later day as any analysis we did not automate would have to be repeated and the clients would then compare to old data and it would invariably lead to contradictions. Alse the CRO team liked to provide highly optimistic reports of their success. This would lead to moments of great consternation when the trend suddenly reversed. The queries were run any differently the outcome would And convince managment when the analyst and later their department heads calls to finalize the presentation. The data ended up showing that both overall and for the three main use cases the service was a win for end users and had reduced a significant load at the call center at peak hours. This was one of the best results in the quarterly presentation and though we told the story we never did a reporting solution. The takeaway is that few analytics products reach production.\nData collected and cleaned was analyzed and reported and then comes the time to take action. But when we considered segments and sub segments the data recommended a opposing action. For almost every segmentation the recommended action reverses.The situation was that it was impossible and to understand if a recently launched product was a success or a failure and furthermore if this was due to the promotion or the product design, and what should the client do next, drop it, keep it and if so which channels to use and which market segments to proceed dfocus acquisition efforts. The elephant cannot come from the data alone.\nLike in many situations the client\nAnother situation is the A/B testing. Where clients interested in becoming more data driven are often tempted to cut a test short of a conclusive outcome and risk making a decision that will negatively impact their business instead of driving it forward.\nStorytelling also operates on a cognitive level helping transform the abstractions of data analysis into more engaging material.",

    "text": "§3.2 Local Attention\n in §3.2 they consider a local attention mechanism. This is a resource saving modification of global attention using the simple concept of applying the mechanism within a fixed sized window.\n\nWe propose a local attentional mechanism that chooses to focus only on a small subset of the source positions per target word. This model takes inspiration from the tradeoff between the soft and hard attentional models proposed by Xu et al. (2015) to tackle the image caption generation task.\n\n\nOur local attention mechanism selectively focuses on a small window of context and is differentiable. … In concrete details, the model first generates an aligned position p_t for each target word at time t. The context vector c_t\n\nis then derived as a weighted average over the set of source hidden states within the window [p_t−D, p_t+D]; Where D is empirically selected.\nThe big idea here is to use a fixed window size for this step to conserve resources when translating paragraphs or documents - a laudable notion for times where LSTM gobbled up resources in proportion to the sequence length…\nThey also talk about monotonic alignment where p_t=t and predictive alignment\n\np_t=S\\cdot sigmoid(v_p^Ttanh(W_ph_t))\n\n\na_t(s)=align(h_t,\\bar{h}_s)e^{(-\\frac{(s-p_t)^2}{s\\sigma^2})}\n\nwith align() as defined above and\n\n\\sigma=\\frac{D}{2}\n\n\n\n\n\n\npage 5\n\nThe rest of the paper has details about the experiment and is of less interest\n\n\n\n\n\npage 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\npage 7\n\n\n In §5.4 In alignment quality\n\n\n\n\n\npage 9\n\nsome sample translations\n\n the references\n\n This is appendix A which shows the visualization of alignment weights.",

We learn about the normal distribution and its importance in statistical analysis, as well as the Poisson distribution, which is used to model counts of events.\nThe book introduces us to the use of statistical transformations, such as the log transformation, which is often used to make skewed data more normal. We also learn about density estimation and the use of histograms and kernel density estimates to visualize data.\nThe concepts of sampling and random variables are explored, as well as the calculation of sample means and standard errors. We also learn about the use of random samples from Monte Carlo simulation to approximate probabilities and calculate statistics.\nThe book covers the use of algorithms and samplers, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to explore parameter space and to generate samples from distributions of interest. We learn about the importance of convergence and the use of proposals in Monte Carlo sampling.\nThe concepts of bias and variance are explored, as well as the calculation of confidence intervals and the use of hypothesis testing to evaluate statistical significance. We also learn about the use of the bootstrap and jackknife methods to find the level of uncertainty in our estimates.\nThroughout the book, we are introduced to the use of R for statistical computing. We learn about the use of formulas to specify statistical models, as well as the use of packages for data manipulation and visualization.\nOverall, “Statistical Computing with R” is an essential resource for anyone interested in using statistical methods to analyze data.

We learn to seek a baseline model then approach the problem at hand with a Bayesian perspective.\nThrough the use of Bayesian models, we can compute the conditional distributions of our data and evaluate the error and loss functions. We must consider convergence, the choice of priors, and how they are specified. We use Bayes’ rule to compute the posterior distribution and marginal likelihood, and we obtain point estimates and credible intervals.\nThe use of the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in MCMC methods are presented as tools to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution. We use WinBUGS code and Monte Carlo simulations to produce results that are in line with the data observed.\nWe are introduced to the concept of the Bayes factor, and how it is used to compare models. We also understand how the use of the Jeffreys prior, the hyperprior, and the conjugate prior can be used to simplify our computations.\nIn Bayesian methods, we use the full conditional distributions to obtain the joint posterior distribution of our parameters. We also compute the marginal posterior distribution, which can be used to obtain a credible interval.\nWe are shown how to deal with univariate and multivariate data, and how to model the random effects and covariate effects. We also understand how to evaluate the performance of our models through histograms, percentiles, and plots.\nIn this work, we are presented with a practical and useful guide to Bayesian methods that can be applied to a variety of problems."

    "text": "Introduction\nEver since I saw (White 2022) the video lecture on subtasks by Martha White about learning tasks in parallel. However the video does not address the elephant in the room - how to discover the options.\n\nWhite, Martha. 2022. “Developing Reinforcement Learning Agents That Learn Many Subtasks.” YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmGL9cVfJG4&t=6s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Talk at Waterloo.AI by Martha White on Developing Reinforcement Learning Agents that Learn Many Subtasks. She makes the case for the life long problem setting and discusses recent research on learning multiple tasks (options and GVFs) in parallel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Talk at Cohere.AI by Marlos C. Machado on Representation-driven Option Discovery in Reinforcement Learning. He discusses the Representation-driven Option Discovery (ROD) cycle and how it can be used to discover options in reinforcement learning. The talk covers much of the material in the paper as well as some more recent follow up work.\n\n\n\n———. 2024. “Representation-Driven Option Discovery in Reinforcement Learning.” YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9gYmYEYuIs.\n\n\nThis is a hefty paper 70 pages with 8 algorithms many figures and citations from research spanning thirty years. It is filled to the brim with fascinating concepts that are developed by the authors but builds on lots of work by earlier researchers. It may seem to cover a niche topic but (c.f. Machado 2024, time 773) makes an eloquent argument that this paper deals with a fundamental question of where options come and if we put aside the jargon for a second we are trying to capture a form of intelingence that includes elements of generalization, planning, problem solving, learning at a level much closer what we are familiar with. And these familiar forms of mental abstractions much harder to consider in the context of Supervised or Unsupervised learning which lack the ineraction with the environment that is the hallmark of reinforcement learning.\nI came about this paper by accident. I a quick summary before I realized how long it was and I put out my first pass, and I hope to flesh it including perhaps a bit of code.\nI’ve been developing my own ideas regarding the creation and aggregation of options in reinforcement learning. My thinking to date has been different. I am exploring a Bayesian based tasks. I’ve considered creating shared semantics via emergent symbolic semantics and looking at a number of composability mechanisms for state, language and of options including using hierarchial bayesian models. While working on coding environments for this subjects a search led to this amazing paper!\nIn (reinforcement_2024?) Marlos C. Machado, has given a talk that explains many of the complex ideas within this paper. This talk is available on YouTube.\nMarlos C. Machado is a good speaker and going over that paper and the video certainly helps to understand the challenges of temporal abstractions as well as the solutions that the paper proposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n\nThis paper posits that successor representations, which encode states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstraction like options if these are not known.\nOptions are a powerful form of temporal abstraction that allows agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment in ways idiosyncratic of human approach to tackle many problems. One of the key questions has been how to discover good options. The paper presents a rather simple yet powerful answer to this.\nHere is a lighthearted Deep Dive into the paper generated by notebooklm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasoning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is one of the key attributes of intelligence. In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results, showing how the successor representation can be used to discover options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option discovery in which the agent’s representation is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended exploration and on the use of the successor representation to combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of different methods based on the successor representation, such as eigenoptions and the option keyboard.\n— (Machado et al. 2023)",

However, if one considers the gray tiles to be walls, an agent in point A can reach point B much quicker than point C. The SR captures this distinction, ensuring that, in this representation, point A is closer to point B than it is to point C. The plots of the SR were generated using a discretization of the grid, where each tile is a state.

    "text": "Study guide for the paper\n\nWhat is an option in reinforcement learning?\n\nWe actually took the definition from the paper. But here is another from the video. This is perhaps a more elegant definition. It comes from []\nIn reinforcement learning, an option is a temporally extended course of actions that allows an agent to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment. Options are a form of temporal abstraction that enables agents to make predictions and execute actions over extended time horizons, providing a way to structure and organize the agent’s behavior. \nv_{\\pi,\\beta}^{c,z}(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi,\\beta} \\left[ \\sum_{j=1}^K c(S_j) + \\gamma^{K-1} z(S_k) | S_0 = s \\right] \\qquad \\text{for all } s \\in S\n\n\nwhere\n\nv_{\\pi,\\beta}^{c,z}(s) is the value function of the option,\n\\pi is the policy,\n\\beta is the termination condition,\nc is the extrinsic reward function, z is the intrinsic reward function,\nS_j is the state at time j,\nK is the duration of the option, and\n\\gamma is the discount factor.\n\n\n\nHow can options be used ?\n\n\nFor planning: you can use eigenvectors of the SR to identify bottleneck, states that are difficult to reach under a random walk, and then use options to guide the agent to those states. c.f. (Solway et al. 2014)\nFor exploration: you can use eigenoptions to encourage exploration by driving the agent toward states that are difficult to reach under a random walk.\n\n\nSolway, Alec, Carlos Diuk, N. Córdova, Debbie M. Yee, A. Barto, Y. Niv, and M. Botvinick. 2014. “Optimal Behavioral Hierarchy.” PLoS Computational Biology 10.\n\nExplain the successor representation\n\nThe successor representation (SR) is a method in reinforcement learning that represents states based on their expected future visits under a given policy. It captures the environment’s dynamics by encoding how likely an agent is to visit each state in the future, starting from a particular state.\n\nThe SR is denoted as Ψ_π, where π represents the agent’s policy.\nIt can be estimated online using temporal difference learning and generalized to function approximation using successor features.\n\nThe SR allows for Generalized Policy Evaluation (GPE): once the SR is learned, an agent can immediately evaluate its performance under any reward function that can be expressed as a linear combination of the features used to define the SR.\nThe SR offers a powerful tool for discovering and using temporal abstractions in reinforcement learning, enabling the development of more intelligent and efficient agents. It is used in option discovery methods like eigenoptions and covering options, providing a natural framework for identifying and leveraging temporally extended courses of actions.\nHere is a breakdown of the mathematical definition of the SR:\n\nΨ_\\pi (s, s') =  \\mathbb{E}_{π,p} [\\sum^\\infty_{t=0} γ^t\\mathbb{1}_{S_t = s'} | S_0 = s ] \\qquad\n\\tag{5}\n\nWhere:\n\ns, s' are states in the environment.\n\\gamma is the discount factor, determining the weight of future rewards.\nThe expectation (E) is taken over the policy \\pi and the transition probability kernel p.\n\\mathbb{1}_{S_t = s'} is an indicator function that equals 1 if the agent is in state s’ at time t, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nThis equation calculates the expected discounted number of times the agent will visit state s’ in the future, given that it starts in state s and follows policy π. The SR matrix stores these expected visitations for all state pairs.\n\nExplain what is an eigenoption a covering option and the difference\n\nEigenoptions and covering options are two methods for option discovery in RL that use the successor representation (SR). Options represent temporally extended courses of actions.\nEigenoptions are options defined by the eigenvectors of the SR.\n\nEach eigenvector of the SR assigns an intrinsic reward to every state in the environment.\nAn eigenoption aims to reach the state with the highest (or lowest) value in the corresponding eigenvector.\nThey encourage exploration by driving the agent toward states that are difficult to reach under a random walk.\nEigenoptions have a broad initiation set, meaning they can be initiated from many states.\nThey terminate when the agent reaches a state with a (locally) maximum value in the eigenvector, meaning the agent can’t accumulate more positive intrinsic reward.\nEigenoptions tend to have different durations based on the eigenvalue they are derived from, allowing the agent to operate at different timescales.\n\nCovering options are defined by the bottom eigenvector of the graph Laplacian, which is equivalent to the top eigenvector of the SR under certain conditions.\n\nThey aim to minimize the environment’s expected cover time, which is the number of steps needed for a random walk to visit every state.\nEach covering option connects two specific states: one with the lowest value and one with the highest value in the corresponding eigenvector.\nThey are discovered iteratively. After each option is discovered, the environment’s graph is updated, and the process repeats.\nCovering options have a restrictive initiation set, containing only the single state with the lowest value in the eigenvector.\nThey terminate when they reach the state with the highest value in the eigenvector.\n\nHere’s a table summarizing the key differences between eigenoptions and covering options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nEigenoption\nCovering Option\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nBased on any eigenvector of the SR\nBased on the bottom eigenvector of the graph Laplacian (equivalent to the top eigenvector of the SR under certain conditions)\n\n\nGoal\nReach states with high/low values in the corresponding eigenvector\nMinimize environment’s cover time\n\n\nInitiation Set\nBroad (many states)\nRestrictive (single state)\n\n\nTermination Condition\nReaching a (local) maximum in the eigenvector\nReaching the state with the highest value in the eigenvector\n\n\nDiscovery Process\nCan be discovered in parallel, in a single iteration\nDiscovered iteratively, one option at a time\n\n\nTimescale\nDifferent eigenoptions can have different durations\nGenerally have similar durations\n\n\n\nBoth eigenoptions and covering options can be effective for exploration, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

    "text": "Abstract\n\nLarge decoder-only language models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models on most of today’s NLP tasks and benchmarks. Yet, the community is only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 4 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 8B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data (as of May 24, 2024). Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.\n\n\n\n\nThe 3 steps of LLM2Vec\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation on word level tasks\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised results",

    "text": "Introduction\n(Wang et al. 2024) the authors present an end-to-end framework to train a Large Language Model (LLM) to become a Lean4 expert. 1 The framework includes NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TheoremLlama by achieving cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%.2\n\nWang, Ruida, Jipeng Zhang, Yizhen Jia, Rui Pan, Shizhe Diao, Renjie Pi, and Tong Zhang. 2024. “TheoremLlama: Transforming General-Purpose LLMs into Lean4 Experts.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03203.\n1 Note: lean has a serious learning curve and is used in many current mathematics research projects.2 But is this sufficient to make a difference in the real world? GPT-4 isn’t expected to do well on lean…. TheoremLlama is a significant step towards using LLMs’ natural language abilities to formalize theorem proving in Lean4, improving mathematical reasoning, and tackling major issues with data alignment and training approaches.\nHowever, the lack of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data frequently makes it difficult for contemporary LLMs to operate efficiently. The lack of available resources impedes the advancement of efficient training approaches and strategies to fully utilize LLMs’ potential in creating formal mathematical proofs. In order to overcome these limitations, a team of researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Illinois Urban-Champagin has introduced TheoremLlama, an end-to-end framework created to specialize a general-purpose LLM in Lean4 theorem proving.\nTheoremLlama is made up of various important parts, which are as follows:\n\nNL-FL Aligned Dataset Generation: TheoremLlama presents techniques for creating an NL-FL-aligned dataset in order to get over data shortage. This dataset, called Open Bootstrapped Theorems (OBT), uses a bootstrapping technique to include NL proofs into Lean4 code. By integrating NL reasoning into Lean4 scenarios, the framework improves LLMs’ comprehension and execution of formal reasoning.\nFormal Training for LLM Theorem Provers: The system applies new training strategies to help LLMs become successful Lean4 theorem provers. Methods like block training and curriculum data sorting have been utilized to enhance the LLM’s in-context learning and guarantee reliable training on the OBT dataset. LLM Lean4 Proof Writing: This part is about improving the LLM’s capacity to write formal proofs in Lean4 on its own. The LLM refines its formal reasoning abilities iteratively by using correctly generated proofs as examples.\nTheoremLlama’s NL-FL bootstrapping approach is a significant invention that enables efficient training by coordinating natural language reasoning with formal mathematical language constraints. The framework’s efficiency has been demonstrated by experimental findings, which on the MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets, respectively, yielded cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61%. These outcomes outperformed GPT-4’s baseline findings, which on the same datasets yielded accuracies of 22.95% and 25.41%.\n\nIn conclusion, TheoremLlama is an important step towards using LLMs’ natural language abilities to formalize theorem proving in Lean4, improving mathematical reasoning, and tackling major issues with data alignment and training approaches",

    "text": "Review\nThe paper has a table with some network architectures and their performance on the ImageNet dataset. In many cases data scientist etc. like to copy the architectures of well known models and use them in their own work. So this paper is a good reference for giving a few more options for architectures to use.\nThe paper uses 3x3 convolution filters which is a common practice in modern CNN architectures.\n\nWe use very small 3 × 3 receptive fields throughout the whole net, which are convolved with the input at every pixel (with stride 1). It is easy to see that a stack of two 3 × 3 conv. layers (without spatial pooling in between) has an effective receptive field of 5 × 5; three such layers have a 7 × 7 effective receptive field. So what have we gained by using, for instance, a stack of three 3 × 3 conv. layers instead of a single 7 × 7 layer? First, we incorporate three non-linear rectification layers instead of a single one, which makes the decision function more discriminative. Second, we decrease the number of parameters: assuming that both the input and the output of a three-layer 3 × 3 convolution stack has C channels, the stack is parametrised by 3 (32C2) = 27C^2 weights; at the same time, a single 7 × 7 conv. layer would require 72C2 = 49C2 parameters, i.e. 81% more. This can be seen as imposing a regularisation on the 7 × 7 conv. filters, forcing them to have a decomposition through the 3 × 3 filters (with non-linearity injected in between).\n\nThe authors also reference 1 × 1 convolutions from [NiN] paper which also have large FC layers at the end.\n\n\n\narchitecture\n\n\nWhere: - A is 11 layered. - A-LRN is 11 layered but have Local Response Normalization. - B is 13 layered. - C is 16 layered but has 1x1 convolutional layers. - D is 16 layered but 1x1 convolutional layers in C are replaced with 3x3 convolutional layers. - E is 19 layered\nTraining\nThe result were state of the art but by 2018 (Goyal et al. 2017) it would be possible to train a ResNet-50 imagenet classifier in under an hour of compute with just using 256 GPUs. There is little novelty in the methods. The authors simply increased the depth of the network and increase the umber of parameters.(but they also used them more efficiently).\n\nGoyal, Priya, Piotr Dollár, Ross B.

The difference is that VGG19 has 3 more convolutional layers than VGG16. Since these extra convolutional layers are stacked after two other layers, the receptive field of VGG19 is larger than that of VGG16. Also the CNN also have a RELU so that the network also has increased discriminative power. This means that VGG19 can capture more complex patterns in the input image than VGG16. However, this comes at the cost of more parameters and more computation. In practice, VGG16 is often used because it is simpler and faster to train than VGG19.\n\n\n\nVGG16\n\n\n\n\n\nVGG19",

    "text": "Abstract\n\nThe choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.\n— (Rezende and Mohamed 2016)\n\nRezende, Danilo Jimenez, and Shakir Mohamed. 2016. “Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows.” https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05770.\n\n\n\n\nfigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nalgorithm 1\n\n\n\n\n\nfigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\ntable 1",

    "text": "Summary\nIn (Mozer and Smolensky 1988) the authors presents a novel approach to simplifying neural networks by systematically identifying and removing redundant or less-relevant units. The authors address a key challenge in connectionist models: understanding and optimizing the network’s behavior by trimming unnecessary components without losing functionality.\n\nMozer, Michael C, and Paul Smolensky. 1988. “Skeletonization: A Technique for Trimming the Fat from a Network via Relevance Assessment.” Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 1.\nThe core idea of the paper is to iteratively train a network, compute a relevance metric for each input or hidden unit, and eliminate the units that are least relevant to the network’s performance. The skeletonization process offers several practical benefits:\n\nConstraining Generalization: By reducing redundant units, skeletonization effectively limits the network’s complexity, which can enhance its generalization capability.\nImproving Learning Performance: Networks often require many hidden units to quickly learn a dataset. Skeletonization accelerates initial learning with excess units and trims unnecessary ones later, leading to better generalization without sacrificing learning speed.\nSimplifying Network Behavior: The authors argue that skeletonization can transform complex networks into simpler models, effectively capturing core decision-making rules.\n\nThe technique contrasts with other approaches such as weight decay methods by opting for an all-or-none removal of units, motivated by the desire to identify the most critical components through explicit relevance metrics. These metrics are determined by computing the network’s error with and without specific units, using a time-averaged relevance estimate.",

The metric can be computed via an error propagation procedure similar to backpropagation, making the approach computationally feasible for larger networks.\nPractical Application in Simple Examples:\n\nIn the cue salience problem, the relevance metric highlights the most critical input unit, effectively eliminating irrelevant units.\nIn the rule-plus-exception problem, the method identifies the hidden unit responsible for most general cases, while distinguishing another unit that handles exceptions, reflecting the nuanced task structure.\nThe train problem demonstrates the technique’s ability to reduce inputs to a minimal set of features needed to differentiate categories.\n\nSkeletonization in More Complex Tasks: Mozer and Smolensky apply skeletonization to more sophisticated problems like the four-bit multiplexor and the random mapping problem, showing that skeletonized networks can outperform standard ones in terms of both failure rate and learning speed.",

The networks show resilience in maintaining their functionality even as units are removed.\nImprovement in Learning Time: The authors provide evidence that learning with an initially large network and then trimming it can lead to faster convergence than training a smaller network from the start. This result challenges conventional thinking that fewer hidden units should always be preferable from the outset.\nRule Abstraction: The skeletonization process successfully identifies essential “rules” that govern network behavior, making it easier to interpret a network’s decisions in a simplified and concise manner.",

    "text": "Abstract\nTo build agents that can collaborate effectively with others, recent research has trained artificial agents to communicate with each other in Lewis-style referential games. However, this often leads to successful but uninterpretable communication. We argue that this is due to the game objective: communicating about a single object in a shared visual context is prone to overfitting and does not encourage language useful beyond concrete reference. In contrast, human language conveys a rich variety of abstract ideas. To promote such skills, we propose games that require communicating generalizations over sets of objects representing abstract visual concepts, optionally with separate contexts for each agent. We find that these games greatly improve systematicity and interpretability of the learned languages, according to several metrics in the literature. Finally, we propose a method for identifying logical operations embedded in the emergent languages by learning an approximate compositional reconstruction of the language.",

This is just a coordination part of communication.\n\nThese tasks are more difficult 3\n3 adding categories can result in a combinatorial increase the total messages. So that the agents need to coordinate on one of many more equilibria. Also you now want the agents to learn a much narrower subset of those possible equilibrium i.e. those that are are faithfull to certain structures in of the states. This is essentially a new problem which could be embodies as a second step after the Lewis game. There is no guarantee in general that such a structure exists. And as the authors suggest other structures are not considered\n\nIn the set reference (setref) game, a teacher must communicate to a student not just a single object, but rather a group of objects belonging to a concept 4\n4 this is an interesting game - and also similar to add reference one modifies the game to refer to set of states by adding and, or and not operators giving an agent an basic reasoning ability. The new signaling systems allows specifying many more states. This can be useful in many applications. Of course learning to send additional operators becomes trivial conceptually if not in the practical sense\n\nThese tasks are more difficult than traditional reference games 5\n5 a “concept” like a red triangle is a specific type of a set. so this should be a easier task than the set reference.

    "text": "I tracked this paper due to it being highlighted in (Skyrms 2010) as the source of a model that learns a signaling systems faster. I got me started with the loss domain. I was eventually able to find how to speed up learning by in the Lewis signaling game by considering the much more likely mistakes. Once I got on this algorithm I was thinking that using this idea for Bayesian updating of beliefs. This eventually led me to a second algorithm that was able to rapidly adjust a belief regarding the the state of the world in lewis signaling game with changing distributions.\n\nSkyrms, Brian. 2010. “Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information.” In. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580828.003.0013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Learning to become a successful loser in a nutshell\n\n\nBesides having this amazing title this research paper compares five mathematical models that predict student behavior in repeated decision-making tasks involving gains and losses. The core issue is how to accurately represent the effect of losses on learning, as observed deviations from expected utility theory exist They conducted an experiment and find that learning in the loss domain can be faster than in the gain domain. The main results suggest that adding a constant to the payoff matrix can accelerate the learning process, supporting the adjustable reference point (ARP) abstraction of the effect of losses proposed by (Roth and Erev 1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main difficulties in the development of descriptive models of learning in repeated choice tasks involves the abstraction of the effect of losses. The present paper explains this difficulty, summarizes its common solutions, and presents an experiment that was designed to compare the descriptive power of the specific quantifications of these solutions proposed in recent research. The experiment utilized a probability learning task. In each of the experiment’s 500 trials participants were asked to predict the appearance of one of two colors. The probabilities of appearance of the colors were different but fixed during the entire experiment. The experimental manipulation involved an addition of a constant to the payoffs. The results demonstrate that learning in the loss domain can be faster than learning in the gain domain; adding a constant to the payoff matrix can affect the learning process. These results are consistent with by (Roth and Erev 1995) adjustable reference point abstraction of the effect of losses, and violate all other models\n— (Bereby-Meyer and Erev 1998)\n\nRoth, Alvin, and Ido Erev. 1995. “Learning in Extensive-Form Games: Experimental Data and Simple Dynamic Models in the Intermediate Term.” Games and Economic Behavior 8 (1): 164–212. https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:gamebe:v:8:y:1995:i:1:p:164-212.\n\nBereby-Meyer, Yoella, and Ido Erev. 1998. “On Learning to Become a Successful Loser: A Comparison of Alternative Abstractions of Learning Processes in the Loss Domain.” Journal of Mathematical Psychology 42 (2-3): 266–86.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights the difficulty in developing descriptive models of learning in repeated choice tasks that involve potential losses.\nPresents the main goal of the paper: to compare the descriptive power of five distinct solutions to this difficulty and to identify a robust approximation of learning in simple decision tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModels and Solutions\n\n\nDiscusses the difficulty in abstracting the effect of losses given the approximately linear relationship between choice probabilities and the ratio of accumulated payoffs observed in the gain domain.\nIntroduces probability learning tasks used to derive and compare the predictions of different models.\nPresents five alternative solutions to the problem:\n\nLow Reference Point (LRP):\n\nTransforms objective payoffs into non-negative rewards by subtracting the worst possible outcome\n\nAdjustable Reference Point and Truncation (ARP)\n\nUses an evolving reference point to distinguish gains and losses and truncates negative values to ensure positive propensities\n\nExponential Response Rule (EDS, EFP, EWA)\n\nApplies an exponential function to propensities, eliminating the need for handling negative values directly.

One way to speed up learning is to try and increase our reward signal.\nThis is the basis for seeling out to decompose the reward signal into an internal motivation for the agent and an external motivation for the problem designer.\nAnother approach though is to consider the loss domain. If we can get signals out of losses we can speed up learning and RL agents are slow learners - especially deep RL agents.\nA third approach that I was able to make use of is to use both the loss domain and the gain domain to update beliefs about the possible states of the world. This was allowed me to speed up Bayesian learning algorithm for a coordination task.\n\nBesides this the paper has a lot of possible options for potential update rules to get this potential speed up.\n\nHow does adding a constant to all payoffs in a decision task affect learning, and which model best explains this effect?\n\nOne of the results I learned is that adding a constant to the payoff matrix doesn’t change it. In fact linear transformations of the payoff matrix don’t change the outcomes. In policy gradient methods this we call this trick learning with baselines. What we see is that it doesn’t bias the estimator but can drastically reduce the variance of the estimator. And this variance is the noise that slows down learning by the agent. So adding a constant can surprisingly impact learning speed. The ARP model uniquely predicts this: subtracting a constant to introduce losses speeds learning compared to a purely gain-based scenario. This highlights the psychological impact of the gain-loss framing.\nAnother insight I had about this is while trying to abstract the RL algorithms. Was that under some conditions we can convert the reward function into a distance metric. Having a metric makes navigation states space much simpler. I really can’t think of a better feature.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the ARP model?\n\n\nThe ARP model, with its current parameters, assumes an initial reference point of zero and a slow adjustment process. This might not hold when:\n\nAll options are positive: The model would predict slow learning even when clear differences exist.\nSocial comparison exists: People may adjust their reference point based on other players’ payoffs, a factor not currently incorporated in the model.\n\n\n\nHow would you define the loss domain and the gain domain ?\n\n\nThe gain domain is when choice probabilities are approximately linearly related to the ratio of accumulated reinforcement.\nThe loss domain is when negative payoffs are possible.\nIn the gain domain, the probabilities of choosing an alternative match the ratio of accumulated reinforcement, meaning that individuals are more likely to choose options that have yielded higher rewards in the past.\nDescriptive models have to assume that choice probabilities are determined by a function of the accumulated reinforcements, which must have strictly positive values. However, this presents a problem when losses are possible because negative payoffs can result in negative values for the function.\n\n\nIn the paper the autors mention the value function from prospect theory c.f. (Kahneman 1979). How does this relate to the ARP model?\n\n\nKahneman, Daniel. 1979. “Econ Ometrica i Ci.” Econometrica 47 (2): 263–91.\nThe authors state that models that use solutions other than the adjustable reference point can account for the results of the study under the assumption that the model’s parameters can be affected by the payoffs. One way to account for this is to use reinforcement functions with the characteristics of Prospect Theory’s value function. Prospect theory, developed by Kahneman and Tversky, suggests that individuals make decisions based on the potential value of losses and gains rather than the final outcome, and that losses have a greater impact on individuals than gains do. This relates to the ARP model because it also assumes that reinforcements are evaluated relative to a reference point, meaning outcomes above the reference point are perceived as gains (reinforcements) and outcomes below the reference point are perceived as losses (punishments).\n\nIs there a formal definition of this prospect theoretic value function?\n\n\n\n\n\na value function\n\nA key element of this theory is the value function, which exhibits these characteristics: - It’s defined on deviations from a reference point. - It’s generally concave for gains and convex for losses. - It’s steeper for losses than for gains, meaning an equivalent loss has a greater psychological impact than the corresponding gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaper",

They replaced traditional linear filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to enhance local feature abstraction. This new architecture, called NIN, also introduces global average pooling in place of fully connected layers thus reducing overfitting, improving model interpretability and more significantly reducing the size of the network.\nIt took a while for the idea to catch on, but in computer vision, most of the parameters are in the fully connected layers, and the NIN architecture enables us to to reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected layers thereby breaking the curse of dimensionality in CNN. Once people realized this the NIN architecture became more widely adopted and influenced the development of more sophisticated deep learning architectures like the Inception architecture and further refined into the Resnet architecture\nThe NIN architecture has a significant impact on the design of CNNs by demonstrating that local feature abstraction can be enhanced with MLPs, leading to better performance with fewer parameters. Global average pooling, which replaces fully connected layers, makes the architecture more robust to overfitting and spatial translations, making it a powerful tool for image classification tasks. This combination of techniques has influenced the development of more sophisticated deep learning architectures, particularly in domains where model interpretability and reduced overfitting are critical.",

This new architecture, called NIN, also introduces global average pooling in place of fully connected layers thus reducing overfitting, improving model interpretability and more significantly reducing the size of the network.\nIt took a while for the idea to catch on, but in computer vision, most of the parameters are in the fully connected layers, and the NIN architecture enables us to to reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected layers thereby breaking the curse of dimensionality in CNN. Once people realized this the NIN architecture became more widely adopted and influenced the development of more sophisticated deep learning architectures like the Inception architecture and further refined into the Resnet architecture\nThe NIN architecture has a significant impact on the design of CNNs by demonstrating that local feature abstraction can be enhanced with MLPs, leading to better performance with fewer parameters. Global average pooling, which replaces fully connected layers, makes the architecture more robust to overfitting and spatial translations, making it a powerful tool for image classification tasks. This combination of techniques has influenced the development of more sophisticated deep learning architectures, particularly in domains where model interpretability and reduced overfitting are critical.",

    "text": "Abstract\n\nWe propose a novel deep network structure called “Network In Network” (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking multiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.\n– (Lin, Chen, and Yan 2014)",

    "section": "Key Contributions",
    "text": "Key Contributions\nThe NIN paper makes several key contributions to the deep learning landscape:\n\nMlpconv Layer: Instead of using traditional linear filters, NIN proposes the use of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) within the convolutional layers (termed mlpconv layers). These layers act as universal function approximators, capable of modeling more complex representations within local receptive fields. This structure allows for better abstraction of non-linear latent concepts, overcoming the limitations of traditional linear filters in CNNs.\n \nGlobal Average Pooling: NIN introduces global average pooling as an alternative to fully connected layers in the final classification stage. This technique computes the spatial average of each feature map, feeding the result directly into a softmax layer for classification. By avoiding fully connected layers, the model becomes less prone to overfitting, thus improving generalization performance. Furthermore, this method provides more interpretable results by establishing a direct correspondence between feature maps and class labels.\nState-of-the-Art Performance: The authors demonstrate that NIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, without the need for extensive data augmentation or model ensembling. The architecture consistently outperforms other methods, such as maxout networks and CNNs with dropout regularization, especially in terms of classification accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nCifar-10 error rates",

This structural regularization helps to prevent overfitting, particularly on datasets with limited training examples, such as CIFAR-100.\nBetter Interpretability: The global average pooling layer allows for easier interpretation of the learned feature maps, as each map is directly associated with a class.

While NIN excels in these scenarios, it would be interesting to see how the architecture performs on larger, more complex datasets such as ImageNet, where the size and variety of the data might pose additional challenges.\nLack of Depth Exploration: While the architecture consists of three stacked mlpconv layers, the paper does not deeply explore the impact of adding more layers or experimenting with deeper NIN networks. Such exploration could provide insight into how well the architecture scales with increased model depth.",

This challenge is known as the “superposition” problem, where multiple meanings of a word are combined into a single vector, potentially leading to suboptimal performance in downstream NLP tasks.

    "text": "Motivation and Related Work\nThe motivation behind SENSE2VEC stems from the shortcomings of earlier models like Word2Vec and Wang2Vec. Word2Vec, while highly successful, does not consider the order of words in a sentence and struggles with polysemy—the phenomenon where a single word can have multiple meanings. Wang2Vec improves upon Word2Vec by incorporating word order, making it more suitable for syntactic tasks, yet still relies on single embeddings per word, making it less effective for handling polysemic words.\nOther approaches, such as multi-prototype vector-space models by Reisinger and Mooney (2010), attempt to tackle polysemy by clustering the contexts in which a word appears and generating different embeddings for each cluster. However, these methods often require unsupervised clustering, making the process computationally expensive and difficult to apply in a scalable fashion. SENSE2VEC circumvents these challenges by leveraging supervised learning with part-of-speech (POS) tagging or named entity resolution, reducing the computational overhead while providing more accurate disambiguation.",

For example, the word “bank” can have distinct embeddings for its noun and verb forms.\nThe model can be trained using traditional methods like Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-gram, with a key difference: instead of predicting words given surrounding words, SENSE2VEC predicts word senses given surrounding senses.

Record Breaking\nWhile all papers should have break new ground, I follow (Kuhn 1962) in differentiating between what in … considered a jump and a gradual improvement. Most papers that announce a new SOTA results are gradual improvements - essentially tweaks to well understood experiments while the truly ground-breaking papers are rare. Often, we see the authors taking an innovation from another field (perhaps a theoretical result) and applying it to a new domain. Less frequently, the author connects several previously unrelated results or techniques and does something considered impossible. Finally, there are papers where the authors ignore prior art and develop several original ideas, creating a new field. (Like Nash did with non-cooperative game theory)\n\nKuhn, Thomas S. 1962.

However, research from information science indicates that it can take a few years for results to circulate, become cited, and adopted. This paper often seems irrelevant later on when there is new research that can get more powerful results. Record-breaking papers (most common) beat the SOTAs by a few fractions of a point and typically arrive in black-box models, and their ‘black magic’ is neither fully understood nor transferable and hard to apply.

However, but teaching is often not the forte for most gifted researchers - sometimes their finest hours are when writing papers. Another point is that in the class teachers are very much limited by the material they can present - the students can only cover so much new mathematics in a class. In a paper they are writing to their peers so that all bets are off and the material can be as advanced as needed and touch on many disparate fields. In Skrym’s book on the evolution of signaling systems routinely touch on game theory, evolution, information theory, sociology, and classical philosophy.

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification, and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.",

    "text": "Core Ideas\nThe central concept behind dropout is to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. In a traditional neural network, feature detectors can co-adapt to specific patterns in the training data, which leads to poor generalization. By randomly omitting neurons with a probability of 0.5 during training, each neuron is forced to contribute independently to the final output. This reduces the reliance on specific sets of neurons and ensures that each feature detector learns useful patterns.\nAnother significant advantage of dropout is that it acts as an efficient form of model averaging. Training with dropout can be seen as training an ensemble of neural networks that share parameters, making it computationally feasible to obtain better generalization without having to train multiple models.",

In standard practice, model averaging is performed by training multiple models and averaging their predictions, but this approach is computationally expensive. Dropout provides a far more efficient alternative by implicitly training an ensemble of models that share parameters, thus achieving the benefits of model averaging without the overhead of training separate models.\nAdditionally, dropout mitigates the problem of overfitting by introducing noise during training, making the model more robust.

    "section": "Background: Gaussian Processes",
    "text": "Background: Gaussian Processes\nA Gaussian process is any collection of random variables such that the marginal distribution over any finite subset is a multivariate normal distribution. For a detailed look at GPs in the context of regression, check out Gaussian Process Regression in TensorFlow Probability.\nWe use a so-called index set to label each of the random variables in the collection that the GP comprises. In the case of a finite index set, we just get a multivariate normal. GP’s are most interesting, though, when we consider infinite collections. In the case of index sets like \\mathbb{R}^D, where we have a random variable for every point in D-dimensional space, the GP can be thought of as a distribution over random functions. A single draw from such a GP, if it could be realized, would assign a (jointly normally-distributed) value to every point in \\mathbb{R}^D. In this colab, we’ll focus on GP’s over some \\mathbb{R}^D.\nNormal distributions are completely determined by their first and second order statistics – indeed, one way to define the normal distribution is as one whose higher-order cumulants are all zero. This is the case for GP’s, too: we completely specify a GP by describing the mean and covariance. Recall that for finite-dimensional multivariate normals, the mean is a vector and the covariance is a square, symmetric positive-definite matrix. In the infinite-dimensional GP, these structures generalize to a mean function* m : \\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}, defined at each point of the index set, and a covariance “kernel” function, k : \\mathbb{R}^D \\times \\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}. The kernel function is required to be positive-definite, which essentially says that, restricted to a finite set of points, it yields a postiive-definite matrix.\nMost of the structure of a GP derives from its covariance kernel function – this function describes how the values of sampeld functions vary across nearby (or not-so-nearby) points. Different covariance functions encourage different degrees of smoothness. One commonly used kernel function is the “exponentiated quadratic” (a.k.a., “gaussian”, “squared exponential” or “radial basis function”), k(x, x') = \\sigma^2 e^{(x - x^2) / \\lambda^2}. Other examples are outlined on David Duvenaud’s kernel cookbook page, as well as in the canonical text Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.\n* With an infinite index set, we also require a consistency condition. Since the definition of the GP is in terms of finite marginals, we must require that these marginals are consistent irrespective of the order in which the marginals are taken. This is a somewhat advanced topic in the theory of stochastic processes, out of scope for this tutorial; suffice it to say things work out ok in the end!",

    "section": "Applying GPs: Regression and Latent Variable Models",
    "text": "Applying GPs: Regression and Latent Variable Models\nOne way we can use GPs is for regression: given a bunch of observed data in the form of inputs \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N (elements of the index set) and observations \\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^N, we can use these to form a posterior predictive distribution at a new set of points \\{x_j^*\\}_{j=1}^M. Since the distributions are all Gaussian, this boils down to some straightforward linear algebra (but note: the requisite computations have runtime cubic in the number of data points and require space quadratic in the number of data points – this is a major limiting factor in the use of GPs and much current research focuses on computationally viable alternatives to exact posterior inference). We cover GP regression in more detail in the GP Regression in TFP colab.\nAnother way we can use GPs is as a latent variable model: given a collection of high-dimensional observations (e.g., images), we can posit some low-dimensional latent structure. We assume that, conditional on the latent structure, the large number of outputs (pixels in the image) are independent of each other. Training in this model consists of 1. optimizing model parameters (kernel function parameters as well as, e.g., observation noise variance), and 2. finding, for each training observation (image), a corresponding point location in the index set. All of the optimization can be done by maximizing the marginal log likelihood of the data.",

    "text": "Abstract\n\nOne way of simplifying neural networks so they generalize better is to add an extra term to the error function that will penalize complexity. Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple Gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms\n– (Nowlan and Hinton 1992)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight clustering - a perplexing idea & Other quandaries\n\n\n\nThis notion of clustering weights is odd to say the least as these are just numbers in a data structure. Viewed as a method to reduce the effective number of parameters in the model, it makes some convoluted sense. What this idea seems to boil down to is that we are prioritizing neural net architectures with some abstract symmetry in the weights and thus a lower capacity and thus less prone to overfitting.\n\nWe shall shall soon see that the authors have attempted to motivate this idea in at least two ways:\n\nWeight decay - the penalty is a function of the weights themselves based on (Plaut, Nowlan, and Hinton 1986)\nA Bayesian perspective - is a negative log density of the weights under a Gaussian prior.\n\nit might also help if we learned that mixture models are often used to do clustering in unsupervised learning.\n\nA few quandaries then arise:\n\nHow can we figure for different layers having weights, gradients and learning rates being more correlated then between layers.\nThat there may be other structure so that the weights are not independent of each other.\n\nIn classifiers the are continuous approximation of logic gates.\nIn regression settings their values approximate continuous variables ?\n\nIn many networks most of the weights are in the last layer, so we can use a different penalty for the last layer.\nIs there a way to impose an abstract symmetry on the weights of a neural network such that is commensurate with the problem?\nCan we impose multiple such symmetries on the network to give it other advantages?\n\nInvariance to certain transformations,\nusing it for initialization,\nmaking the model more interpretable,\nOnce we learn these mixture distribution of weights, can we use its parameters in, batch normalization, layer norm and with other regularization techniques like dropout?",

    "section": "The problems with Mamba for vision tasks",
    "text": "The problems with Mamba for vision tasks\nA dilettante reader like myself might be interested in the author’s outline of the shortcomings of the Mamba architecture for vision tasks and earlier attempt in (Zhu et al. 2024) vision mamba model which directed thier efforts the right direction.\n\nZhu, Lianghui, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024. “Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2401.09417.\n\n… the Mamba’s autoregressive formulation, while effective for tasks requiring sequential data processing, faces limitations in computer vision tasks that benefit from a full receptive field1:\n\nUnlike sequences where order matters, image pixels do not have a sequential dependency in the same way. Instead, spatial relationships are often local and need to be considered in a more parallel and integrated manner. Hence, this results in inefficiency for processing spatial data\nan autoregressive model like Mamba processes data step-by-step, limiting its ability to capture and utilize global context in one forward pass. In contrast, vision tasks often require understanding the global context to make accurate predictions about local regions\n\n1 seeing the full picture or at least big parts of it\n\nVision Mamba (Vim) and others have proposed modifications such as bidirectional SSMs to address lack of global context and spatial understanding. While bidirectional SSMs have the potential to capture more comprehensive context, they introduce significant latency due to the need to process the entire sequence before making predictions. Additionally, the increased complexity can lead to challenges in training, risk of overfitting, and may not always result in better accuracy. Due to these pitfalls, backbones with Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures still outperform best Mamba-based vision models on different vision tasks. — (Hatamizadeh and Kautz 2024, 2)\n\nHatamizadeh, Ali, and Jan Kautz. 2024. “MambaVision: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2407.08083.\n\nTo sum all this up - Mamba’s auto regressive nature is well suited to temporal and sequential data like text and speech but is ill suited to handle spatial data like images where order manifests as a hierarchy of spatial neighborhoods which should be processed in parallel. Thus for vision, mamba suffer a loss in the efficiency of the flow of information both locally and globally. As such pre mamba vision models fare better.\nThe next section outlines the ideas espoused in prior work both pre and post mamba. This section summarizes both the earlier work on computer vision models since the introduction of Transformers and some results since the introduction of the Mamba architecture.\n\nVision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al. 2021) showed that CNNs can be replaced with self-attention, but wasn’t data efficient.\nData-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) (Touvron et al. 2021) used distillation to train ViT more efficient.\nLeViT model (Graham et al. 2021) introduced a redesign for MLP and self-attention with a Lenet like pyramid pooling structure.\nCross-covariance Image Transformer (XCiT) (Ali et al. 2021) introduced transposed self-attention mechanism more effectively modeling interactions between feature channels.\nThe Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) (Wang et al. 2021) improving efficiency by adopting a hierarchical structure with patch embedding at the start of each stage and spatial dimension reduction.\nSwin Transformer (Liu et al. 2021) used shifted windows to improve the efficiency of self-attention computation.\nTwins Transformer (Chu et al. 2021) featured spatially separable self-attention that significantly enhanced efficiency.\nFocal Transformer (Yang et al. 2021) used a focal mechanism to improve the efficiency of self-attention computation for capturing long-range interactions.\n\n\nDosovitskiy, Alexey, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, et al. 2021. “An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929.\n\nTouvron, Hugo, Matthieu Cord, Matthijs Douze, Francisco Massa, Alexandre Sablayrolles, and Hervé Jégou. 2021. “Training Data-Efficient Image Transformers & Distillation Through Attention.” In International Conference on Machine Learning, 10347–57.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Acquiring the desired font for various design tasks can be challenging and requires professional typographic knowledge. While previous font retrieval or generation works have alleviated some of these difficulties, they often lack support for multiple languages and semantic attributes beyond the training data domains. To solve this problem, we present FontCLIP: a model that connects the semantic understanding of a large vision-language model with typographical knowledge. We integrate typography-specific knowledge into the comprehensive vision-language knowledge of a pretrained CLIP model through a novel finetuning approach. We propose to use a compound descriptive prompt that encapsulates adaptively sampled attributes from a font attribute dataset focusing on Roman alphabet characters. FontCLIP’s semantic typographic latent space demonstrates two unprecedented generalization abilities. First, FontCLIP generalizes to different languages including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), capturing the typographical features of fonts across different languages, even though it was only finetuned using fonts of Roman characters. Second, FontCLIP can recognize the semantic attributes that are not presented in the training data. FontCLIP’s dual-modality and generalization abilities enable multilingual and cross-lingual font retrieval and letter shape optimization, reducing the burden of obtaining desired fonts.\n— (Tatsukawa et al. 2024)\n\nTatsukawa, Yuki, I‐Chao Shen, Anran Qi, Yuki Koyama, Takeo Igarashi, and Ariel Shamir. 2024. “FontCLIP: A Semantic Typography Visual‐language Model for Multilingual Font Applications.” Computer Graphics Forum 43 (2). https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.15043.",

    "text": "Acquiring the desired font for various design tasks can be challenging and requires professional typographic knowledge. While previous font retrieval or generation works have alleviated some of these difficulties, they often lack support for multiple languages and semantic attributes beyond the training data domains. To solve this problem, we present FontCLIP: a model that connects the semantic understanding of a large vision-language model with typographical knowledge. We integrate typography-specific knowledge into the comprehensive vision-language knowledge of a pretrained CLIP model through a novel finetuning approach. We propose to use a compound descriptive prompt that encapsulates adaptively sampled attributes from a font attribute dataset focusing on Roman alphabet characters. FontCLIP’s semantic typographic latent space demonstrates two unprecedented generalization abilities. First, FontCLIP generalizes to different languages including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), capturing the typographical features of fonts across different languages, even though it was only finetuned using fonts of Roman characters. Second, FontCLIP can recognize the semantic attributes that are not presented in the training data. FontCLIP’s dual-modality and generalization abilities enable multilingual and cross-lingual font retrieval and letter shape optimization, reducing the burden of obtaining desired fonts.\n— (Tatsukawa et al. 2024)\n\nTatsukawa, Yuki, I‐Chao Shen, Anran Qi, Yuki Koyama, Takeo Igarashi, and Ariel Shamir. 2024. “FontCLIP: A Semantic Typography Visual‐language Model for Multilingual Font Applications.” Computer Graphics Forum 43 (2). https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.15043.",

    "text": "Abstract\n\nCross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI). Recent CLWE methods use linear projections, which underfit the training dictionary, to generalize on BLI. However, underfitting can hinder generalization to other downstream tasks that rely on words from the training dictionary. We address this limitation by retrofitting CLWE to the training dictionary, which pulls training translation pairs closer in the embedding space and overfits the training dictionary. This simple post-processing step often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test accuracy. We also retrofit to both the training dictionary and a synthetic dictionary induced from CLWE, which sometimes generalizes even better on downstream tasks. Our results confirm the importance of fully exploiting the training dictionary in downstream tasks and explains why BLI is a flawed CLWE evaluation.computational resources to train.\n— (Zhang et al. 2020)\n\nZhang, Mozhi, Yoshinari Fujinuma, Michael J.

    "text": "Key Points:\n\nTraditional Evaluation of CLWE:\n\nCross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) typically aim to map words from different languages into a shared vector space.\nThey are commonly evaluated using Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI), which tests the model’s ability to translate words based on a set of test words.\n\nUnderfitting in Projection-Based CLWE:\n\nCurrent CLWE methods, particularly linear projection-based ones, underfit the training dictionary. This means they don’t perfectly align all translation pairs in the training data.\nThe paper argues that this underfitting, while beneficial for BLI test accuracy, can hinder performance on downstream tasks where words from the training dictionary play a critical role.\n\nRetrofitting Approach:\n\nThe authors propose retrofitting as a post-processing step to bring training translation pairs closer in the embedding space, essentially overfitting the training dictionary.\nThis retrofitting involves modifying the embeddings to minimize distances between training translation pairs while retaining as much of the original structure as possible.\n\nRetrofitting to Synthetic Dictionaries:\n\nIn addition to the training dictionary, the paper introduces retrofitting to a synthetic dictionary induced from the original CLWE using the Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling (CSLS) heuristic.\nThis helps balance the need to fit the training dictionary while maintaining some generalization capability for unseen words.",

    "section": "Conclusion:",
    "text": "Conclusion:\nThe paper’s main takeaway is that overfitting to the training dictionary via retrofitting is not inherently harmful. In fact, it can lead to better performance on downstream NLP tasks. This insight invites a reconsideration of the evaluation metrics for cross-lingual word embeddings and opens the door for future work on more sophisticated retrofitting and projection methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noverfitting\n\n\n\n\nIt is not surprising that the authors ‘discovered’ that fitting the model on test + train + validation gives better results then fitting on train part only. After all the best way to reduce overfitting is to give it more data.\nThis is a common practice in machine learning to train on the full dataset once we have used to get the best results when the model is deployed to production.\nBayesian LOO Cross validation also allows one to measure the generalization error of the model without having to make the sacrifice of a train/test split.\nConsidering that the dataset is a dictionary means there is probably little noise to overfit on.\n\nOn the other hand their criticism of BLI as a metric is valid. There are lots of bad metrics and it is more so when we wish to use it to estimate performance on a different task. In RL one uses importance sampling to make the correction between on policy and off policy - perhaps this is something to look into, though it would be easier to do this if this was a RL problem rather than supervised ML.\nIt is a common practice in machine learning to use a proxy metric to evaluate the model. The problem is that the proxy metric is not always a good indicator of the model’s performance on the real task. This is why it is important to evaluate the model on the real task as well.",

    "text": "Inlining citations\nOne of the problems with AI is that what is called inference is usually prediction and not the deeper logic ability we associate with aristotle’s syllogism. Modern test for general intelligence also look at coreference resolution and some other abilities that indicate that the model has learned a good representation of the text. The problem with large language models testing on small data sets is that they learn to cheat. This is a different problem from overfitting what happens is that the model learn to defeat the weakness in the dataset rather than addressing the real problem. It does not help that researchers often help it (perhaps even inadvertently).\nHere is an interesting idea find task that are indicative of general intelligence or at least of understanding of non atomic concepts like complex relations, logical inference where multiple deductions may be required to make an inference. And so on. This essentially is going to force the AI to learn multiple level of abstractions.\nSome challenges with setting up a challenge at multiple levels of abstraction is that for the lower level like free text we have lots of data but for more abstract we have orders of magnitude less. One reason why your run of the mill language model can’t do complex reasoning is that it is learning to fill certain gaps in a text but these gaps only require short and rather simple contexts. If the completions were harder it would be have to learn more complex representations and abstractions. Such a model I’d presume have the added benefit of learning to economizing on the use of simpler abstractions. Finally if we had concrete entities we are considering at different levels than we may be able to explore visualize how they are captured by the model. (Are there neurons specializing in entities or relations at certain levels of abstractions.)\nOne approach that I find incredibly attractive is to create a synthetic dataset for this. Creating an extensive syllogism and logical deduction seems of interest particularly as there are few of these in most text. Also this type of thinking is rather limited. First order logic adds to predicate calculus the universal and existential quantifiers and as such seems to deal with absolutes. But absolutes are limiting. You will find few statements of this form in text. When people make use of them they are easily refuted. On the other hand if we are compiling an ontology we easily come across a myriad of such statements but they seem to a human rather trivial - more a fact or definition rather than a high-level of abstraction one can use in a deduction.\nOn the other hand certain types of writing does seem to have more of this - Scientific writing. Perhaps am advantage is that most of it is structured in such a way that there is a section on conclusions. However even encyclopedia articles tend to exhibit more logical deduction that regular texts.\nData :",

    "section": "Why are deep language models SOTA?",
    "text": "Why are deep language models SOTA?\nIn the era of deep learning language model are trained and represented by neural networks. Neural language models have higher capacity for capturing evidence than other language models such as Markov chains. Another facet of higher capacity is that these models learn both the structure and what features are present in the data. I mentioned Markov chains as they are mathematically close to conditional probability distributions with simplifying assumption (similar to back off) which are models. Higher capacity allows neural language model to encode more details from the corpus for a given network size than other models. However, since storage is so cheap what this advantage translates to how well the model can recall and generalize from a limited amount of training data. We should note that neural nets are slow to train slow to evaluate, require lots of data and their high capacity often leads to overfitting as they will learn both signal and noise. Research has shown that for many NLP tasks using the many tricks, models are very simple and research has demonstrated that one can reach equivalent results by fine-tuning non-neural models with the same data. How have language models evolved in the last few years?\nRNNs (recurrent neural networks)\nThe initial breakthrough in NLP were in machine translation using RNNs (recurrent neural networks). But RNN turned out to be one of the most challenging type of models to train. Initially the main problem was to get RNN models to converge - they often entered a chaotic phase and then never leave it later as we learned to get these to converge better than the vanishing and exploding gradient problems came to light which in the case of word distribution was more challenging as the models are multiplicative and when run on GPUs that have low precision representation of floats leads to loss of information due to round off errors. Finally, RNN take longer to train as they grow longer as the models typically need to run N times in series (for N units) which makes poor use of the high parallelism offered by the GPU hardware. In retrospect, we can see that RNN are slow and difficult to train and tend to suffer from information due to an inability to allow information to be accessed over long distances. Some of these issues we addressed by LSTMs and later GRUs. These are more complicated architectures that aim to improve information routing. Using units like RELU and Batch normalization helped to reduce the vanishing and exploding gradients. Which let RNN become effective at a length of about 100 units. But they still had to run in series, and they still tend to lose information. This changed when attention mechanisms and transformers architecture were used in seq2seq models. These models could be evaluated for n-units in a single step. They were mathematically much simpler than LSTM and GRUs and could handle sequences of hundreds of units. This allowed them to pick up long distance structure of language that had eluded RNN based models. More recent improvements like the multi-headed attention and the reformer architecture have led to models capable of handling book long sequences in memory. Transformers are also much better at routing information over these very long sequences.\nAs a rule of thumb the best way to improve a model is to give it more data though this will also require increasing the size of the net and training longer. Transformers would be trained in an unsupervised fashion on web scale corpuses. Models like BER and GP3 soon became some of the biggest models developed for use in Deep Learning. These language models are more flexible that the joint probability models described above in a sense that their internal state seems to capture diverse aspects of both language and of the real world and allows them to perform well on many tasks they were not trained on.\nWhen is bigger not necessarily better?\nOne of the more fatuous points made in the literature is how almost anything that improves the model works as a regularizer - a mechanism that reduces overfitting. Neural nets are notorious for overfitting data due to their high capacity and many methods like early stopping and restoring model weights, adding penalties on kernels, weights, biases and outputs to the loss. Using drop out and batch normalization are some possibilities for use to combat overfitting.\n“Providing more data works well as a regularizer”. This is best understood by considering that language acquisition is many layers ability much like a linguistic onion. The first level might be the use of 1000 core words, a limited vocabulary but all the grammatical words. This is enough for a foreigner to communicate. Next one might master 3000 words get a better grasp of intermediate grammar, and morphology. We could communicate more freely and no longer need a learner’s dictionary. To pick up idioms and phrases that are used in a newspaper one might need to reach 5000 words. To master a technical area like business or medicine one needs about 15000 more words mostly unique to that field so at 20000. But 15,000-20,000 is also the amount of words used by native language speakers. A dictionary for English might have 150,000 words which would give one access to reading literature and even many obsolete words used in older religious works. After that we can consider encyclopedias full of technical information. Wikipedia has over 6,000,000 articles covering many technical and non-technical areas. News and Web sized corpus are even larger.\nWhen we are training a language model it would acquire the most common grammatical words and their grammar. It will, with enough data proceed to learn to acquire the semantics of core concepts in the language even with a limited corpus. At any corpus suited to a given level of words in our onion there will be some words from the next which appear too rarely to fully master. But by the time the model has a distributed representation of say 2000-8000 words and perhaps much sooner the model should be able to comprehend unknown words based on its context and other words most familiar for that context. Models like BERT are trained specifically to predict missing words from sentences.\nThis follows from the law of large numbers arises from a random walk. We know that real signals like features tend to aggregate over time while spurious signals tend to cancel out. The challenge is that each time we double our data we will add new features in the form of rare words phrases entities and even senses for words that have not been seen before. At the same time evidence will build up due to chance for phrases or grammatical structures. The net will try to learn all of these.\nLike technical term in a news corpus may we will make sense because the net is trained to penalize bad input and as more evidence is presented it will learn to tell apart spurious data patterns that arise due to chance from real patterns. The law of large numbers means that distributions tend - but it needs to see the real ones patterns in such quantity that their signals overpowers noise. (Adding more data also adds more chance that some spurious patterns will appear frequently)much more frequently.\nThe unreasonable effectiveness of transformers soon lead us to see that test used in evaluating the language skill, comprehension ability of these models are easily beaten by ML. We are not easily able to make tests that are easy for humans and almost impossible for models. Also, it can be challenging to tell text generated by these models (and cherry-picked by the developers) from text written by human writers. This has led many people to think that these models have become truly intelligent in the sense that they comprehend texts about the real world.\nDeeper scrutiny shows that neural language models are incapable of doing basic arithmetic which is not a language skill. They are also seemed to recall and recreate approximation of text that they have seen - much like 4-GRAM models trained on the works of Shakespeare - they will spew long sequences they remember. It is not impossible to make very smart models, but it is much easier to make a model that seems smarter than it is.\nAn early result in image processing comes to mind - a model that was able to tell apart tanks from trucks was able to do this by summing all the pixels because one group was taken on a sunny day and the other an overcast day. Image classifiers will learn to focus on a single pixel per class if such pixels are unique to each class. It becomes increasingly challenging as the data grows to ensure what is going on within the model.\nModels like GPT3 used massive compute and lots of data but were developed using poor methodology, so that success on downstream tasks could not be credited to anything other than having seen similar data. This leads more NLP practitioners to consider that the larger model sizes is not necessarily a better model in the sense that a smarter/more efficient representation should be able to provide better results. While there are general research groups like Open AI who build bigger model like GPT2 and GPT3 there are other researchers who work on\nSome known issues with neural networks are that they tend to overfit the data which means that every larger datasets are required to regularize this. Recent language models like GPT2, GP3 etc. use a very large number of parameters. Scrutiny of their output leads to output that appears to be written by humans. However, this is familiar issue from 4-grams or 5-grams N-grams models where sparsity of data (say the complete works of Shakespeare) leads to more and longer sequences being memorized by the (Markov chain model) and the output being a somewhat lossy compression of the corpus. As DNN will prefer to memorize and then retrieve the data rather than to model and infer. In the case of DNN with internet sized corpuses the researchers can easily fool themselves that the model is not stitching up its output from more examples rather than learning to model what is needed to represent the language. (Note Wikipedians also frequently stitch up articles on subject they are not very knowledgeable about and only domain experts can readily find the glaring errors that betray the ineptitude.)\nSpecifically we are now seeing and therefore expecting deep language models to learn the grammar, the lexicon, semantics, pragmatic commonsense knowledge of the world, and a rudimentary logical reasoning ability.\nClassic Linguistic theory postulates that an efficient representation of language should consist of a grammar and a lexicon. This approach was shown to make sense in computational area of morphology where finite state morphologies were most efficiently represented by specified and combining a grammar with a lexicon.",

    "text": "How Can we explicitly process higher level construct\nAs pointed earlier models that model sequences using a probabilistic grammar rather than looking just at sequences is going to capture a much richer view of language.\nThere are a couple of reasons for this. Perhaps the more significant factor is the ability to capture much longer sequences which will expose the model to much richer wealth of signals. Grammar is typically represented using production rules which typically replace a symbol with two or more new symbols. These require moderately shorter sequences, and they also have a much lower cardinality for the symbols needed to represent the grammatical entities, at least when compared to the cardinality of the words in a language or its leading categories. For rich morphologies even more significantly. Which means that grammar should be learned much faster than a detailed lexicon. Since rules are so much shorter than sentences the grammar should be learned with significantly higher confidence at any given point.",

And hopefully if with a little luck we could put them together into a package that feeds different attention heads allowing few-shot learning to proceed.\nerDiagram    \n    Thematic-Role-Frame {\n    verb move-object\n    agent Alice\n    object wedge\n    destination block\n    }    \n    Thematic-Role-Frame ||--|| State-Change-Frame : induces     \n    State-Change-Frame {\n    object alice\n    destination happy\n    }\nSo this is splits cause action from its outcome.\nBayesian Games and Sub\nIn a Bayesian game there are a number of constructs, lets put them into a pro-ontology\nerDiagram    \n    Action-Frame {\n    verb move-object\n    agent Alice\n    object bullet\n    destination Bob\n    tool gun\n    visibility universe\n    }\n    Action-Frame ||--|| State-Change-Frame : induces\n    Action-Frame ||--|| Agent-Frame_1 : participates\n    Action-Frame ||--|| Agent-Frame_2 : participates\n    Action-Frame ||--|| Information-Set-Frame : visibility\n    State-Change-Frame {\n    object alice\n    destination angry\n    info-set universe\n    payoffs Alice_1__Bob_0\n    }\n    Information-Set-Frame{\n    name universe\n    members Alice_Bob\n    }\n    Agent-Frame_1 {\n    name Alice\n    type robber\n    info json_data1\n    }\n    Agent-Frame_2 {\n    name Alice\n    type sherif\n    info json_data1\n    }\n    Info-Frame_0 {\n    Alice-Type any\n    Bob-Type any\n    }\n    Info-Frame_1 {\n    Alice-Type robber\n    }\n    Info-Frame_2 {\n    Bob-Type sheriff\n    }\n\n    State-Change-Frame ||--|| Information-Set-Frame : visibility\nHow many information sets for k players?\nThere are 2^k and they form the power set of \\{a \\space ... \\space k\\}.\nA Bayesian game usually start with a move by nature which assigns types to players m_n: p \\to \\tau.",

    "text": "The classical Q&A task is fairly easy to solve. But how well does the IR system understand/model the data. The challenge to test this aspect of the system is to provide test of increasing difficulty.\nDifficulty can be due to different reasons:\n\nDue to polysemy of words representing the concepts in the query.\nDue to synonymy used for the text in the document\nDue to ambiguity. Ambiguity actually comes in several flavours, morphological (pos) and semantic (word sense) and in the real world there are frequently several ambiguities in a single sentence. Being able to resolve should allow the system to reject many irrelevant results.\nDue to inference required to reach the answer when the underlying facts are available in the text.\nAnother challenge might be due to common-sense reasoning\nAnother challenge might arise when resolving the query requires specialized domain knowledge.\n\nIR systems typically index information in a document and respond to queries by ranking the document based on some correlation between the contents of the question and the document. Most Q&A systems go one step further and learn to point at the answer within the document. In a search engine this might be the snippet or the link might be able to highlight the result in the actual. To properly evaluate the above capabilities is difficult because one need to be certain the challenge cannot be solved using a much simpler capability.\nHowever for most of these challanges it is entierly possible that the text does not have a answer to extract.

When this is not done the project will incur a technical debt.\nSo what is readable code. Writing lots of comments in the code is not the way to go. Comments within a function should only have to explain what remains unclear when looking at the code. A common example is in the handling of edge cased. Literate programming proponent Donald Knuth recommended using comment blocks to explain the intent/algorithm being employed.\nOne trade-off that I meet when doing integration rich project is a choice between cross-platform code (something that could be read by a C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Go developer) or idiomatic code which while more concise would be challenging to a newbie.\nOne such idiom which I first learned in Java is the use of anonymous function say for defining a one off event handler. UI code rich with nested anonymous object made me very uncomfortable decoding what those anonymous objects would have been in a “simpler” world. However, I noticed all this idiomatic anonymous one time objects actually hold one or two lines of handle code. That is a lot of boilerplate code which drowns out the real implementation.\nSo one take away - idiomatic code may be indecipherable to a maintainer.\nThe plot thickness when In a latter edition of Java this idiom was “expanded” when it became possible to instantiate an anonymous object from just an interface by providing implementation for all the anonymous overrides.\nAnd later yet another twist Java introduces lambdas expression reducing the boilerplate code by eliminating both the types being passed and the method name of the handler which was overridden. This shorthand makes code more concise as the compiler takes on the responsibility of sorting out the pesky details. We write less boilerplate code and perhaps create fewer bugs. But is it more or less expressive - is the learning curve steeper?\nIn Android, perhaps the final bastion of Java UI developers idiomatic coding leads to …\nFor example an Iterator loop versus a for each loop versus a for loop.\nIn Android, we often see something like:\n// view references\nprivate ListView mMessageListView;\n...\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n...\nmMessageListView = findViewById(R.id.messageListView);\n...\n// Init message ListView and its adapterList&lt;FriendlyMessage&gt; friendlyMessages = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();mMessageAdapter = new MessageAdapter(this, R.layout.item_message, friendlyMessages);mMessageListView.setAdapter(mMessageAdapter);\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2021,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {A Type of {Witness} and an Evolving {Idiom}},\n  date = {2021-07-14},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2021/2021-07-14-type-witness-evolving-idiom/2021-07-14-type-witness-evolving-idiom.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2021. “A Type of Witness and an Evolving\nIdiom.” July 14, 2021. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2021/2021-07-14-type-witness-evolving-idiom/2021-07-14-type-witness-evolving-idiom.html.",

    "text": "Out of core learning\nMany of the training loops I wrote for NLP transformers use an out-of-core approach. This simply means there is a low level generator for the data set we cannot store in memory and there is a higher level loop or generator that uses an index or a hash for the data and fits in memory where we manage metadata such class, error rates, and other metadata. We then manage shuffling and augmentation and batching at the second level . One Example is when working with reformer style transformers in NLP we want to bucket together rows of certain length. Another aspect of using this approach is due to augmentation where we want to generate and cache augmented cycles. Of course all these make the notion of an epoch more complicated.

Fixed effects are estimated using least squares (or, more generally, maximum likelihood)\nUnder the Random Effect or Population Average Effects* model we assume that the true effect size varies for each individuals and has a population statistic. random effects are estimated with shrinkage (“linear unbiased prediction” in the terminology of Robinson, 1991)\nMultilevel (hierarchical) models get their name from their functional form which relates higher level features depend on the lower level ones.\nPooling\nShrinkage AKA Partial-Pooling county specific means are pulled toward the population mean. More generally shrinkage is predictions shifting towards the population average. See Shrinkage in Mixed Effects Models\nSmoothing of uncertainty: Uncertainty about the county-specific means is lower (sometimes much lower) than if these parameters were estimated independently. (Better than the non-pooling model)\nProportional borrowing of information: Shrinkage and uncertainty reduction do not occur uniformly - information-poor counties must borrow a great deal of information from the other counties, while information-rich counties do not.\nnon-IID or Multicolinearity - Multilevel models can handle data at different levels that would be\nHomoscedasticity of the data can be handled by the model (when gradients are allowed to vary).",

    "text": "Hierarchical Intercepts and Slopes\n\n\n\n\nhierarchical-intercepts-model\n\nA primary strength of multilevel models is the ability to handle predictors on multiple levels simultaneously. If we consider the varying-intercepts model above:\n\ny_i = \\alpha_{j[i]} + \\beta x_{i} + \\epsilon_i\n\nwe may, instead of a simple random effect to describe variation in the expected radon value, specify another regression model with a county-level covariate. Here, we use the county uranium reading u_j, which is thought to be related to radon levels:\n\n\\alpha_j = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 u_j + \\zeta_j\n\n\n\\zeta_j \\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2)\n\nThus, we are now incorporating a house-level predictor (floor or basement) as well as a county-level predictor (uranium).\nNote that the model has both indicator variables for each county, plus a county-level covariate.\nIn classical regression, this would result in collinearity. In a multilevel model, the partial pooling of the intercepts towards the expected value of the group-level linear model avoids this.\nGroup-level predictors also serve to reduce group-level variation \\sigma_{\\alpha}. An important implication of this is that the group-level estimate induces stronger pooling.",

But since natural language is highly redundant it is fairly easy for the model to face bottlenecks by simply learning to represent the language more efficiently and still memorize as much as it can. We call these new representations embeddings and acknowledge that they are a step in the right direction. However, one still want to reduce the tendency to memorize input output pairs while promoting the acquisition of more general translations mappings. A second way this can be done is to use drop out to destroy parts of the input or parts of the network forcing the representation to be more redundant. These are just two of a family of methods called regularization which are used to reduce overfitting, which is a term for the tendency to memorize both signal and noise.\nFor example, by encoding German text and then decoding English text one could perform machine translation. In this scenario we want our model to learn an abstract rotation matrix that lets us look up words and phrases in context (i.e. specific word senses) and get their translation.

It can then eliminate any ungrammatical sequences and then make a more informed choice on the word it picks. The beam search alg has a horizon which limits the distance it looks at.\n\nAre there types of patterns that will be missed due to horizon’s distance?\nIs there a beam search that augments the probablitic conditioning of a sequence with an attention mechansim. The model uses attention for the current word.\nWe might be generating good sequences by the data for deciding case, gender or other agreement choices might be masked in the future.

Yoga has many benefits but also many risks, these are rarely discussed. Many yoga benefits are experienced in the short term but the risks if incurred can be long term. For example:\n\nheadstands can be high risk for the neck if done wrong.\nshoulder stands are fine if weight is on the shoulders by risky if weight is put on the neck. - Can you be sure you will never turn your head to the side? - Shoulder stands variations like hallasana, or plow pose, put more weight on the neck then the shoulder stand itself. Without good mobility in the entire spine, the weight of the body can easily damage the cartilage in the neck. Both have health benefits and can be done safely many times without injury. But it only takes one accident to cause a long term injury to the neck. Also some damage to the neck may be cumulative and not felt until years later. As we age the cartilage in the neck becomes less elastic and more prone to damage. If the weight is put on the neck particularly in the headstand, where the spinal column has a radius of 2 cm, the weight of the body can easily damage the cartilage in the neck. Crush the nerves in the neck etc. My wisest yoga instructor put it succinctly “these asanas are the bread and butter for chiropractors”. There are many other risky asanas in yoga and it is wise to know these risks. In my experience with the other asanas knowing the risks alleviates most of the danger.\n\nspinning classes are some of the worst activities for the knees.\ncycling on the other hand has many benefits including the knees, legs, and the glutes.\nalthough I recommend walking - lower impact alternatives like swimming, rowing, and cycling and the elliptical machine are better. If you switch between these activities on a weekly basis that would boost the benefits by avoiding overuse injuries as well as adapting of different muscle groups to the activity. Again the same rule - try to get more milage in the same time, rather than increasing the time.\nNutrition\navoid red meat\navoid red wine and beer and sugary drinks\nconsider drinking sugar free cranberry juice.\nlosing weight is a long term strategy to improve joint health. 1. it reduces the load on the joints. 2. it reduces the inflammation in the body. 3. it reduces load on kidneys which can help clean up the blood better and avoid gout. 4. and quick loss of fat can trigger gout attacks, kidney stones, and release any toxins stored in the fat. so it is much smarter to lose weight slowly. Also rapid weight loss means 50%+ muscle loss. This is not a smart strategy as rebuilding muscle is much harder than losing fat and creates a lot of stress on the joints. Idealy, you want to lose .5 kg a week, no more. That’s tricky to track because of the daily fluctuations in weight. Its better in many ways to try to perfect you dietry routines and let the weight loss happen naturally. You could monitor your weight daily but only take the weekly average as the real weight. Use this moving average for guidamce how effective your routine is working.\njoint supplement like glucosamine and chondroitin have not had any success for me\n\n\n1 Ikigai - but try to get further each day in this time2 “sitting is the new smoking”\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\neating breakfast of:\n\n1/2 cup of fiber one\n1/2 cup of yogurt\n5 walnuts\n10 cranberries\nminimal pro-biotic yogurt drink (like Yakult)\n\nisn’t just a good way to stat the day but also helps take care of several goals at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2013,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {Life Hacks},\n  date = {2013-06-07},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2013/2013-06-07-lifehacks/2013-06-07-lifehacks.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2013. “Life Hacks.” June 7, 2013. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2013/2013-06-07-lifehacks/2013-06-07-lifehacks.html.",

    "text": "Command line\nWorking in the terminal can be a major productivity booster as well as an enabler for skill that don’t exists for high-level gui users. The linux philosophy is that a command should do just one thing and really well. The true power of the shell comes from being able to chain commands, redirect output and so on. Mastering the command line is easier said than done as: - Most commands come with short and uninformative names which are at best contractions. e.g. bc, rm, ls, cd - Many commands require using many flags and it is near impossible to remember these flags. - Some commands like sed, awk, troff are small programming languages which means it is kind of easy to forget how to do things you already figured out. - Some commands work differently on different flavours of linux as well as in different shells - Unix commands come win man pages which are generally so unfriendly that they are only useful to settle quibbles amongst experts who may have different versions of some command. - Some commands require the use of regular expressions, which may take a long time to fully master. - Some commands are require more advanced domain knowledge like the os or networking to fully grok. - Practice makes perfect or at least helps so power users will embrace the austerity of the command line to continually practice - Working with remote machine and containers will require editing files remotely in environments that cannot be accessed with a gui editor and may only support very limited editing like: nano, vi or even just just sed which is a stream editor. For these many reasons its great to have a some references if you need to use the command line. ## Navigation & Process control | command | shortcut | note | |———|—————-|————————————| | | ctrl + u | clear the prompt | | | ctrl + a | jump to prompt home | | | ctrl + e | jump to prompt end | | | ctrl + f | froward word | | | ctrl + b | back word | | clear | ctrl + l | clear screen (with cr) | | reset | ctrl + k | reset terminal | | | ctrl + c | break | | | ctrl + z | suspend | | fg | | resume | | bg | | resume in background | | exit | ctrl + x | exit shell | | | ctrl + u | clear the prompt | | | fn + f | full screen | | | fn + f11 | minimize windows to access desktop | | | cmd + r + ptrn | reverse search | | | cmd + r | reverse search next | for more shortcuts see this | command | note | |————————|————————————————-| | cd - | cd to the previous dir | | cd ~ | cd to the home dir | | pushcd /etc | cd to /etc, pushing current path into the stack | | … | do some commands | | popcd | pop to original dir | | cmatrix | matrix style screensaver | | brew install cmatrix | install cmatrix on macos | | history | list history | | !100 | re run item 100 in history | | trash fname | send it to recycle bin, good for directories | | code . | open vscode with current folder | | cmd1 ; cmd2 | chain commands | | cmd 1 && cmd 2 | chain commands using and | | ls &gt; out.txt | redirect to new out.txt | | ls &gt;&gt; out.txt | redirect append | | cmd 2&gt; log | redirect err to log | | ls -1 &&gt; log | redirect out and err to log | | ls -1 2&gt;&1 | combine standard error into standard output | | ls | wc | pipe | | head fname | | | tail -f fname.log | watch tail of a log | | mount | column -t | converts output into columns | | lsaf -i tcp:8891 | check if port is in use/free (8891 is jupyter) | | ps | | | kill -9 | | | man cmd | | | tar | | | chmod | | | cat fname | | | less fname | | | more fname | | ### Ports of interest in DS & co. | software | note | |———-|—————| | jupyter | 8889 | | spark | 6066 and 7077 | | redis | 6379 | | postgres | 5432 | ## Git commands the main tasks are: - staging changes - committing good changes - putting risky dev in branch - switching branches - going back - merging conflicts | command | note | |————————————-|————————————-| | git clone | make a local copy + set remote | | git remote | view remote | | git remote add name url | add remote | | git remote rm name | remove remote | | git pull | | | git fetch | | | git merge | | | git branch | list branches | | git branch experiment | create new branch | | git branch -d experiment | safe delete crazy-experiment | | git push origin –delete experiment | delete remote branch | | git push | | | git status | compare local repo with remote repo | | git add | | | git commit -m “msg” | | | git stash | | | git unstash | | see https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix for modern unix commands modern unix commands ## ripgrep a grep with .gitignore ripgrep - recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore | command | note | |————————————–|——————-| | rp | search-text fnmae | | vim +15 | edit from line 15 | | code -g mdp.md:15 | edit from line 12 | | rg search_ptrn fname -r replace_ptrn | grep and replace | |grep -rnw . -e ‘pattrn’| grep recusively all files in . for pattern |\n\n\nbat - a cat + syntax highlighting with git support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand\nnote\n\n\n\n\nbat test.md\n\n\n\nbat –list-themes\nfzf –preview=“bat –theme={} –color=always /path/to/file”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2022,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {Command Line},\n  date = {2022-05-05},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2022/2022-05-05-command_line/2022-05-05-command_line.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2022. “Command Line.” May 5, 2022. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2022/2022-05-05-command_line/2022-05-05-command_line.html.",

    "text": "Setup costs\nYou generally need to pay a developer to code the alternatives, and to setup the code that does the the sampling and book keeping. An IT guy to deploy it and an analyst or data scientist to analyse it and then a marketing manager to decide to take some action (ok the intervention and decide to do more testing.) ## Exploration costs and diminishing return When we want to romanticize researching a new intervention we call it Exploration and then we use the less romantic term Exploitation to refer to making using our current best intervention to get outcomes from our web marketing efforts. A/B tests shunts a percentage of you traffic (often 50%) for the duration of the experiment to an intervention we call B we expect to beat out current best effort which we call A. But since pretty smart people chose A it can take many attempts to find a B that better. Also each time you find a better alternative it get harder and you end up getting smaller improvements this is due to what is called a smaller effect size for the intervention. Consider that you will eventually get to an optimum and need to look at a different strategy to make improvements. The good news is that each time your exploration works out and you get a better outcome the test will end up driving up your kpi and goals. But the bad news is that most of the time you wont be getting a win and conducting the test will cost you in lost action. Most A/B testing platforms can track your goals and will try to minimize the negative impact of the test using power of Bayesian statistics. You should make use of these if they are an option. But if you are getting started you might not have the benefit of integrating this type of stats into your experiment. Also even the amazingly capable people who build these tools can get it wrong and have had to rewriting their systems. The main reason that testing has diminishing returns is that you it is much easier to test for big changes early but small subtle changes which have small effects take longer to achieve statistical significance because we are trying to separate two very similar signals coming from A and B. Each win generally means that the next test will take longer be less likely to be a win and therefore cost more on average.\nAs the are usually diminishing returns from running A/B test. If your landing page has a low conversion rate, say 1.5%. You can do experiments and you might be able to reduce bounce rate by 40% percent which should increase your conversion rate to 1.2%. Next you might be able to increase time on page by 300% using better videos that might boost your conversion rate to 3.5, your might be able to pick a more effective cal to action and get around to 3.7% conversion rates. And you might also add an aggressive exit popup and get to 4.2%. That is a dream scenario that CTR consultants dream about. But if your are not working in a startup and you have a solid marketing team you will probably start with many of the choices near optimum and end up at 3% conversion rate. And each successful test will give you a .1% improvement. That might be ok but such a small improvement will take much longer to reach significance and therefore end up costing more. With all the test you ever do you might never reach 4% Over time you should expect that A/B test will be measuring ever smaller effects and will require more traffic to arrive at a statistically significant result. Longer test will cost more.",

    "text": "Due to a kind grant by the WikiMedia Foundation I was able to attend Wikisym 2012 in Linz Austria what follows is my report on the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe renovated Ars Electronica Center at Linz, seen from the bridge across the Danube at night\n\n\n\nHPaul, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nI am a Wikipedian based in Budapest Hungary. I have been active for the last year with WM.HU and participated in a number of the local event’s chapters ever since being introduced to them at Wikimania 2011 in Haifa. During such a meeting I, Bence Damkos, and other chapter luminaries got to discussing many apparent cultural paradoxes taking place in a virtual community. Since I was studying the theory of games at the time I began to notice that some of the situations were very similar to a classic game such as the prisoner’s dilemma and the battle of the sexes while others resembled second-price sealed actions and bargaining games. I was intrigued and I started publishing some analysis on a page on Meta.\nAt this time I came across some interesting ideas from another researcher, Jodi Schneider who introduced me to the field of Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and to her area of research - the deletion process. Eventually, she suggested that I should attend wikisym. However, I had no background in writing a conference paper I asked her for help and she copy-edited my work guiding me through a number of tricky issues. I eventually submitted the paper and to my surprise, it was accepted. So I took a train to Linz - I was surprised when after boarding the train that I had to reserve a seat and accordingly had to stand for the duration of the five-hour journey. By the time I arrived at the little town it was late and I was exhausted. I took a bus and ended in a hotel by the Danube.\n\n\nAt the Conference\nOn the morning of the conference, I took breakfast and met some of my favorite wikipedians - Maryna Pinchuk and Ryan Faulkner who were preparing to give a paper on their work in running editor engagement experiment - in which I had unwittingly participated. After a short chat I made my way to the venue the Ars Electronica and I could not believe my eyes - the conference was hosted by one of the most amazing technology museums in Europe. In the evening, the building would completely dominate the riverside’s view with its digital animation installations.\n\n\n\n\n\nR. Stuart Geiger\n\n\n\nAnne Helmond, CC by-nc-nd 2.0 via flicker\n\nThe Conference began with a number of presentations. I was impressed by most of the presentation but my sentiments were clearly not shared by everyone at the conference. I later learned that some of the more vehement voices were doctoral students who were out to prove their mettle. The papers that most struck my fancy used a number of novel techniques. Ranging from actuarial, survival analysis through SNA to sentiment analysis. Classifying Wikipedia Articles Using Network Motif Counts and Ratios by Guangyu Wu, Martin Harrigan and Pádraig Cunningham was one of the hardest to understand. It used a novel SNA technique to classify Wikipedia articles. However, it seemed that the other participant did not like the level of detail that the researchers had provided. Dr. Bernie Hoagan a Research Fellow from the Oxford Internet Institute asked the researchers why they had not tried to use ERGMs which might give more accurate results. I would later correspond with Dr. Hoagan and he helped me get started with Social network analysis. A paper by Michela Ferron and Paolo Massa titled Psychological processes underlying Wikipedia representations of natural and man-made disasters. It showcased the use of sentiment analysis. I was already familier with this method from my work in a Natural Language Programming outfit in Israel for which I wrote a search engine for the Hebrew Wikipedia. But I had consider this technique as very complex to set-up. On reviewing the paper I realised that an off the shelf tool called LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) can do the job. LIWC was developed by a team lead by James W. Pennebaker whose book The Secret Life of Pronouns is a gentle introduction to the intricacies of sentiment analysis. What remained difficult to grasp was a three-dimensional model of sentiment. I was unfamiliar with the terminology so I would end up rereading this paper a couple of times. But this was not the only paper to use sentiment analysis or natural language technology. Manypedia: Comparing Language Points of View of Wikipedia Communities by Paolo Massa and Federico Scrinzi which showed a tool that allows users to compare different language edition version of the same article in their own language using machine translation. A second paper to discuss sentiment analysis, this time focusing on talk pages was: Emotions and dialogue in a peer-production community: the case of Wikipedia. This paper used an even more complex paradigm than the previous one. It utilized Margaret M. Bradley & Peter J. Lang’s ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) word list to create a three-dimensional model of sentiment (valence, arousal and dominance). Even more interesting were its conclusions regarding participation of women and its implication on Wikipedia’s growing gender gap.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Ford, Jimmy Wales\n\n\n\nMessedrocker, CC BY 1.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nI would discuss some of my ideas to some of the participants over dinner. One amusing debate included [Stuart Geiger] and when I quoted a point from an excellent paper he pointed out that he had written it. I also met with heather ford who co-authored a paper with Mr Geiger. Heather Ford told us about her blog Ethnography matters which I started to follow because it turns out that ethnography really matters These include work by Stuart Geiger and on the lives of robots using trace ethnography. During the conference I met with Jodi Schneider but we had little opportunity to chat due to an upcoming deadline. I enjoy following her research on deletion as well as on Argumentation in collaborative deliberations. I decided to help Wikipedia’s research newsletter by abstracting and providing laymen’s summaries to CSCW related research.\n\n\nPanels, Demos and Posters\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoebe Ayers at WikiSym\n\n\n\nRagesoss, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nI found out that the WikiSym conference had a colourful history and participated in a discussion mediated by the delectable Phoebe Ayers on the conference’s future. I suggested that the conference should be collocated with Wikimania since this would help reduce cost of community members who attend the Wikimania conference. A second conundrum being debated being the issue of open academy. This was an issue of growing urgency since the WMF, one of Wikisym’s chief sponsors prefers to support open access open research work. I think that Phoebe Ayers is a wonderful person and was sad to hear she was no longer on the foundation board of directors. Another serendipitous facet of the Wikisym conference is the demo and poster session which allow hackers to present their latest breakthroughs and innovations in technology, of Wikis. This had once been the cornerstone of the conference. I met the developers of TikiWiki as well as the a Java based XWiki. I decided that one day I would implement my own version of the wiki.\n\n\nJimmy Wales’ Keynote Address\nWikisym’s keynote was given by Wikipedia’s co-founder Jimmy Wales. He explained how this talk was one of the ticket he would give this year. However, this was a much better talk than he gave at Wikimania. He mentioned research possibilities and he responded to my question. I was and still am considering if population dynamics could affect phase changes within the community. My question was if a Wiki’s community dropped below a certain size if it would no longer be viable to maintain it. One example of a Wiki being shut down was the 9-11 wiki. I found Wales’ answer enlightening - he said that big or small the community should have little problem adapting to take care of it’s Wiki. Another point worth mentioning was his recommendation to use Wiki data sets of smaller wikis in research. He recommended Muppet wiki as an example of a wiki with a significantly different governance structure than Wikipedia.\n\n\nAfter the conference\nFollowing the conference, I kept in touch with a number of the participants. I applied myself to study social network analysis as well as data analysis with R. I increased my participation in the research newsletter. I hope to expand my research further using population dynamics on graphs and evolutionary game theory. However, with all the new research methods, I’ve gleaned. I am uncertain what direction my future investigations will take only that they will be even more exciting than before.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2022,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {Wikisym 2012},\n  date = {2022-07-26},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2012/2012-07-26-wikisym-2012_files/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2022. “Wikisym 2012.” July 26, 2022. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2012/2012-07-26-wikisym-2012_files/.",

    "text": "coordination is difficult – (“Citation Needed,” n.d.)\n\n“Citation Needed.” n.d.\nIn this working paper I would like to collect and develop desiderata for emergent languages. Following (Skyrms 2010) and others, my view of emergent languages began through the lens of a program of minimal extensions to the Lewis Signaling game.\nIn a second working paper titled The Many Path To A Signaling System I collect as well as develop different setting under which emergent languages can arise. Ideally there papers may lead to a better understanding of how we can develop agents with the ability to learn emergent languages with the useful properties.\n(Skyrms 2010) and (Foerster et al. 2016) have shown that we can also add a lot of structure to the signaling system.\nIn his book he considers, learning to reason, learning to form efficient communication networks, learning to use better communication protocols. Others have considers inducting communication protocols from a meta protocol. (Foerster et al. 2016) And this has been coupled with the idea of learning to represent the structure of the state space.\nI think that the coordination problem is the easy part and I have devoted some time to solve it in a number of settings. I think that the next challenge is to learn a reductionist concept for signal aggregation. Something that allows bags of words, ordered sequences and recursive structures to be learned in much the same way. I think this we have not been asking the right questions to find it yet since aggregation is a hard problem. However I think that at this point a starting point exists and the next problem is to learn the structure of the state space. I think that here we can apply some existing algorithms that may be a good fit for Lewis signaling games but it is quite important because the structure of the state space is what will determine the optimality of the language to a particular domain. A second facet is that we should think of a minimal state space that captures the essence of the real world. This should be a model that we can consider sufficiently powerful for real world agents. But in terms of the emergent signaling system I don’t think it will be qualitative or quantitatively all that different from other systems other than this it could act as a good interlingua for transferring between natural languages as well as between tasks in RL. This is therefore the holy grail of emergent languages at this point.",

    "section": "My Desiderata",
    "text": "My Desiderata\nSo the desiderata for emergent languages are\nImportant:\n\n1. Easy to learn\n\nMy experience with the Lewis signaling game is that it is easy to learn and that Natural Languages are not.\n\nHypothesis: Complex signaling that fulfill enough desiderata may suffer from reduced learnability.\nQuestions: Howe can we evaluate the learnability of a signaling system? What are the metrics that we can use to evaluate the learnability of a signaling system?\n\nMinimal description length MDL - the number of bits needed to describe the signaling system is what agents need to coordinate between them to learn a shared communication system.\nWe like to consider two cases: 1\n\n1 I have already written an article on some different ways that signaling systems can be arise.\nthere is a sender/teacher with a good signaling system and a receiver/student learning it.\nthere is no sender/teacher and the agents have to construct such a signaling system from scratch.\n\nthe above notion if MDL is a good metric for the first case but not the second. In the second case we need to consider the complexity of the state space as well as the algorithmic complexity arriving at a common communication system. The cost of coordination of an MDL is subsumed by the cost due to complexity of constructing optimal signaling system that faithfully represent the structure of the state space.\nAnother two points:\n\nLearning a partial system should give agents better benefits than not.\nLearning as a group should be easier and quicker than learning individually.\ne.g. Learning of rules (grammar/morphology) should amplify the learning and generalization of the speaker wrt the structure of the state space.\n\n\n\n2. Optimal for Communication\nAgents should be able to communicate with a high success rate. (This is a doorway to information theoretic formulations)\nEmergent Communications should have an expected success rate of almost 1.\nMany systems with with expected success rate less then are acceptable however we can tend to see agents reach close to 1.\n\n\n3. Resilience to Errors\nSignaling systems should be resilient to errors. As we inject errors into the signaling system we should see a number of features from natural languages emerge.\n\nSignaling systems should be resilient to errors.\n\nSender errors -\nReceiver errors -\nChannel errors - channel coding\n\n\n[] TODO: insert Novak citations\n\n\n4 . Signaling systems should be easy to decode\nComplex signaling systems should be easy to decode. This is a form of channel coding. Huffman coding has this property. It is worthwile considering huffman coding as a working model for the evolution of signaling systems.\n[] Todo: insert reference to unwritten article and code on n-arry huffman coding of syllable based signaling systems. \n\n\n5. Salient wrt. the distribution of states\nSallience means that not all equilibria are the same. e.g. is sylables have energy/calrity costs or then the otherwise sysmetrical equilibria will now have an order and there is a notion of the most salient signaling system.\nSalience is not the same but may also encampass the notions of\n\nrisk minimizing wrt risks associated with signaling - particularly in the case of risks affecting agent’s fitness!\nminimize costs/overhead associated with signaling (in rl there should be a cost associated with each marginal bit that the they send across the channel)\nMinimizing signal length - This may be the reason why the most common states are the shortest signals - using the unmarked case as the default. This is a form of source coding. (Perhaps this items is more fundamental then risk and salience) It may also be the reason why we have vowel harmony in some languages and why there are other types of redundant agreement in different languages.\nA theorem: if a (natural) language arising via evolution has a redundancy that may be removed without loss of information or via context then it will be compressed and eroded or eliminated given time. Thus such features are that exist and are stable are will have a measurable benefits in terms of communication.\n\n\n\n6. The signaling system should be able to generalize to new states\nThis is one needs to be promoted or at least combined with learnability. Generalization means beinng able to learn base forms and generelizing to derived forms autoamtical. It also means being able to compose signals. IT also being able to capture hierarchies and other structures in the state space.\n\nMorphology\n\ninflections-\n\nverb - conjugations\n\nTense and Aspect and Mood systems\n\nnouns - declensions\n\nderivations to other parts of speech\nparadigms for each (e.g. posseives in English)\n\nRelations\n\nSematic Roles\nCoverbs and Complements extend the verbs to cover many related concepts\n\nSyntax for Logical and set theory as a basis for\n\nConjunctions and Disjunctions,\nFirst order/Contrafactual logic Quantifiers\nSubordination and Coordination\n\nSpatio-temporal events\n\nAdverbs and Prepositions\nAdjectives and Adverbs\n\n\n\nevery time an agents learns another part of the system it should have. My solution here leans on using group actions to structure the state space. Either one big one group action like for hebrew or a number of smaller ones like for english.",

Distributional Semantics\nThis central property does not arise in many signaling systems. However distibutional semantics is a property of natural languages. It is the good part of entanglement and disentanglement. It makes it easier to understand things by thier context2 & Distributed Representations\n2 a word is characterized by the company it keeps\nSignaling systems should be alignable with 2000 discourse atoms c.f. (Arora et al. 2018), or a subset if they come from a much simpler state structure.\nIn fact a major point to research on emergent languages get to see if they manifest distributional semantics. I hypothesize that this will happen if the the state space is has a semantic basis - i.e. the state space is a vector space with dimensions that are semantically orthogonal.\n\n\nArora, Sanjeev, Yuanzhi Li, Yingyu Liang, Tengyu Ma, and Andrej Risteski. 2018. “Linear Algebraic Structure of Word Senses, with Applications to Polysemy.” https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03764.\n\n\n9. compositionality - is state has structure the languages it should be preserved/mirrored by the language\nsignificant increase in what it can express and understand. I lean towards adding a topology to captures semantic hierarchies. The different signaling system are associated with a lattice of topological groups with the complete pooling equilibrium at the top and the unstructured separating equilibrium. In between are partial pooling equilibria and the various structured separating equilibria. For compositionality we want to pick certain structured pooling equilibria over the structured separating ones.\n\n\n10. Disentanglement\n\nwe like most morphmes to have unique semantics and not require context to disambiguate them. This places too much of a congnitive burden on speakers and requires learning by learners.\n\n\n\n11. Entanglement\n\nthe language should be able to encode multiple concepts in a single signal when binding moephems etc is clearly more efficent (we never use parts in isolation)\nwhen language encode two or more semantics in a single signal. e.g. ‘They’ encodes (third) person and plural (number) as one signal. This is a pronoun but it is not inflected and is not made of two bound morphemes, it is a single morpheme.\n\nI want to come up with a information theoretic notions behind driving Entanglement and Disentanglement. 1. I think they are based on the mutual information between the signals and the states and relative entropy. 2. THe number of sub-states in the structure is high it best encoded as a group action i.e. a rule 3. If the sub-states are a few it is best encoded as a dictionary 4. If like a pronoun a complex signal is high frequency and high entropy there is a greater fitness to compress them into a single signal. And we might want to reduce errors by intentionally boosting the [phonemic contrast]3.\n3 explain!?In reality natural languages are not optimal in any of these desiderata. They are the result of a long evolutionary process that has been shaped by many factors. However I think that the desiderata are a good starting point for designing a language that is optimal for a particular task.",

This is can be the sender, the receiver or implicit. Without loss of generality we can assume that the sender is the language designer.\nTHe language designer needs 1. to a ‘semantic’ metric to decide when two state are close or distant. 2. a way to deconstruct states into atomic orthogonal/independent parts. I am thinking of normal subgroups.\nNote that we can define the metric on the parts and aggregate them to get the metric on the whole. This is a form of compositionality.\nMore abstractly we can just say that the state is an algebraic topological group.\nSo the language designer can use a template with n part (on for each of the subgroups) Ideal ordered with by the decreasing size to prefix code the sub-states. If they there are duplicate sizes this will yield multiple equilibria to be selected via spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nThe designer now can allocate the states to one of the points in the topology. By picking the system with lowest overall distances we get a regular compositional language.\nSince there are many ways to do this the designer needs to coordinate with the receiver. However since there is greater regularity they only need to coordinate a minimal set with each atomic substate apearing once.",

It seems to be mudding the waters rather then clarifying the problem. It clear thar RNNs and and newer seq2seq models are possible solutions but it seems that in most cases little effort is made to understand the problem mathematically and find the simplest solutions. I think that once we do this we should have both an elementary model of complex signaling. I currently think this may be a form of linear function approximation from RL. However I do not discount later use of deep learning models to learn non-linear variants. It is worth noting that by moving from a linear function approximation to a non-linear ones one expects to lose much and it is unclear that we gain anything at all since languages are discrete.\nand possible function approximation",

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was introduced to the subject of language evolution by Brian Skryms in his book “Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information” where he discusses the evolution of signaling systems and the emergence of language. In it he discusses the role of compositionality in the emergence of language and how it is a key feature of human language. Signals provides a coherent yet multifaceted views of the problem - philosophy, signaling system creation and assimilation via evolution or reinforcement learning. Skryms also considers Logic and complex signaling systems. Yet a unifying theme for this work is a reductionist view of the problem and his attempt to reduce the problem to a model that follows closely the Lewis Signaling Game.\nI like this reductionist approach but I like to also to turn it on its head. By looking at how the problem takes form in more challenging and realistic settings can often uncover the true nature of the problem. Since language emergence is so open ended one might also use it to consider how it empowers agents to coordinate on better decision in ever more challenging problems and settings.\nI first became frustrated with complex signaling systems when I read the chapters in Signals and realized that unlike the other chapters Skryms had not summarized how researchers in the field had come up with a definitive solution to the problem. I reread it a couple of times and finally realized that although he made some very interesting claims this topic was still unresolved. There are many interesting results but there are at least as many open questions.\nThe second time I became frustrated was when I tried to convert the simple signaling RL games into complex ones. Just the material in the book had versions with multiple agents signaling in parallel, one agent signaling without sequence, and agents signaling in sequence. The book also hints at cases where agents may make mistakes and that this is important for the evolution of signaling systems.\nI also was coming across more and more research that isn’t covered in the book that looks at morphology and syntax in the emergence of language. Further more people were using deep learning to overcome the lewis signaling game inability of of arriving decoders for complex signals.\nAt this point I realized that there might be three problems that are being conflated in nature and that we might want to consider them separately as well as together.\n\nthe coordination problem - how agents learn a common convention for signaling and what is the most effective form of the solution.\nthe serialization problem - how the medium will e.g. a noisy channel can introduce additional desirable constraints like shorter signals, saliency, early decoding, (compression, error detection and correction, easy decoding, signal distributions, ). This problem is one which is solved by a decision tree. But the different options for the settings will lead to different optimal solutions. These are hidden by the symmetric form of the rewards in the lewis game.\nthe signal composition problem - given a simple signaling systems and a encoder decoder for the channel how can we add aggregation to the signaling system to make it more efficient. (more expressive, easier to learn, easier to extend, more robust to different errors.)\n\nThis might help answer questions like - why does english use just 39-44 phonemes instead of the full we have a languages making a full use of human phonemes (600 consonants and 200 vowels) ?\nWhat became apparent to me is that the nature of a complex signaling system, depends very much on the game being played by the agents.\nMetrics:\n\nTotal number of signals\nMinimal set of signals needed to learn the signalling system with n-learners with full observability of signal, action and reward by all learners.\nHow long to learn saliency (the distribution states of the world) of signals perhaps adjusted by risk (the distribution of malleuses for wrong action in the each state of the world)\nHow long to coordinate on a basic system with N states and N actions\nHow to learn to coordinate on a huffman cannonical code to optimize a signaling system\nLearning and Coordinating via templates for complex signals\n\nDegree of morphology\nDegree of syntax\nDegree of contextual meaning\nDegree of coordination (and aggreement in templates) and its error correction capacity)\n\nMessage entropy\nRobustness to error in sender, receiver, and channel\nMean\nRegarding complex signaling systems he points out a couple of ideas:\n\nComplex signals might be composed by simple signals from multiple senders.\n\nThe reciever needs to both decode and aggregate the simple signals to infer the state of the world encoded in the complex signal.\nThis is particularly interesting and less artificial once consider realize it leads to a partially observed markov decision process (PMDP).\n\nsenders have partial observability of the state of the world and\nrecievers need to reconstruct the state by aggregating partial messages\n\nIf we might also give the agents types and make the game a bayesian game.\n\nTypes are\n\nKnights - with messages that are always true as well as thier atoms\nKnaves - with messages that are always false.\nNormals - with messages that are sometimes true and sometimes false.\nInsane - who think that thier messages are always true but are actually always false.\netc\n\n\n\nComplex signals might be composed by multiple simple signals from a single sender.\n\nThe complex signal is a bag of signals (i.e. aggregation is not unordered - buy via a conjunction of signals i.e. A and B = B and A).\nThe complex signal is ordered sequence of signals sequence of signals i.e. (A,B) \\neq (B,A) .\nSequences of sequences can capture morphology.\nNatural language adds the notion of recursion - which in terms of mathematically boils down to a a partial ordering of simple signals to form complex signals.\n\n\nThere is a natural tendency to think about the Chomsky hierarchy of languages at this point.\nAlso once there are sequences of signals we will naturally consider ideas from information theory.\n\nEntropy of a signal\nError detection\nError correction\nSource coding (compression)\nEasy decoding of messages\n\nErrors are stated as important in the evolution of signaling systems in the paper of Nowak and Krakauer (1999).\n\nwe\n\nCompression and easy decoding are also important too but this came up later when people noticed that thier agents were learning very inefficient signaling systems (with very long signals)\n\nthis suggests that we add a parameter to the game to penalize long signals.\nand to reward early decoding of the signal.\n\nLogic is also discussed in the\n\nhas an extensive bibliography and I have been following up on some of the references.\nThis is a quick summary of a talk by Marco Baroni on the topic of compositionality in language.

    "text": "When I read a few papers using the referential Lewis signaling game I thought, this should be much faster for complex signaling games I use in my research. But when I got to thinking about coding a Bayesian agent with belief propagation I realized that the referential game is actually not a little easier but essentially trivial to solve even if coding the belief propagation algorithm is not.\nNow that I wrote this up I realize I can code a much simpler algorithm without belief propagation that will solve the referential game in (sub)-linear time complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n\nIn many experiments that RL agents are use the Referential Lewis signaling game, rather than the simple Lewis signaling game (AKA the Lewis Reconstruction Game). But a powerful RL agent can and should learn to exploit this difference and solve the coordination problem in sub-linear time complexity . I therefore recommend that researchers avoid the methodological trap of using the referential Lewis signaling game as a stand in for the simple Lewis signaling game!\n\n\nIn the referential Lewis signaling game, the sender has to choose a signal that will help the receiver identify the correct state. The receiver has to interpret the signal and choose the correct state. This requires planning and coordination between the two agents.\nThe main difference between the referential Lewis signaling game and the simple Lewis signaling game is that in the referential game, the receiver picks from a restricted set of states, rather than the full set of states. For researchers used to supervised learning this seems like a small change - the task looks like the familiar k-way classification task. This seems fine particularly as modern RL agents have neural networks that are built using pretrained classifiers like Clip or Cnns that are trained on ImageNet.\nUsing a pretrained model can let agent completely avoid the coordination problem inherent in the Lewis signaling game and is not the focus of this post. One the other hand the referential Lewis signaling game is also problematic and in a way that RL agents should learn to exploit rather quickly.\nLets consider the basic lewis game with 100 states and 100 signals.\nIn the first round the receiver has a 1/100 chance of decoding the signal correctly. It seed E_1 Say it picks S_1 Now If the state has changed the receiver sees a new signal E_2. If it picks a signal at random it has again a 1/100 chance of decoding the signal correctly again. Though if it picks S_1 again it has a 1/99 chance of decoding the signal correctly, because for it has excluded S_1 for E_1. As the state keeps changing the sender should keep sticking to the same signal as each mistake the receiver makes gives it more information about the meaning of the signal. Boring and slow after 50 round on average the receiver will have decoded the first signal and got its first payoff. It now start from scratch with the second signal and 1/99 chance of decoding it. We can estimate the complexity of the game as O(N^2)\nNow consider the referential game with 100 states and 100 signals and a challenge set of k=4 states.\n\nIn the first round it sees e_1 the receiver has options {s_1, s_2 ,s_3 ,s_4} It has a 1/4 chance of decoding the signal correctly. Again it picks S_1 and looses out. But now it knows\nthe next time it sees e_1 it should pick one of the other three states it has seen before. If all three appear it has a 1/3 chance of decoding the signal correctly by ignoring the state it has not seen before.\nIs the K states are a random sample of the 100 states there is a very small chance that the receiver will see the any of {s_1, s_2 ,s_3 ,s_4} again for e_1 unless it is the correct state! Lets calculate its likelihood if the next such round is the next round.\n\nThe worst case of sees all three candidates {x, s_2 ,s_3 ,s_4} with 3/4 chance of decoding the signal correctly. There are 100-3=97 it can get such a combination.\nnext worst case of sees a combination with two unknown candidates {x, y ,s_3 ,s_4} with 1/2 chance of decoding the signal correctly. There are (99-3)(99-4)  3 such a combinations.\nnext worst case of sees a combination with one unknown candidates {x, y ,z ,s_4} with 1/1 chance of decoding the signal correctly. There are (99-3)(99-4)(99-5)*3 ways it can get such a combination.\nto sum up it has \\frac{(99-3)*(99-4)*(99-5)*3 + (99-3)*(99-4)/2 + 97*3/4 }{(99-3)*(99-4)*(99-5)*3 + (99-3)*(99-4) + 97} = .998 chances of decoding the signal correctly on the next such round. So for the referential game the receiver has a 1/4 chance of decoding the signal correctly in the first round and a 1/998 chance of decoding the signal correctly in the second round for e_1 We can estimate the complexity of the game as O(N)\n\n\nSo by restricting the the options to the receiver the referential game is reduced from square to linear complexity. This is a huge difference also in the worst case the agent need to store N*K-1 states to solve the referential game this way. And in practice it can be solved even faster since after going through every state once the receiver has solved 1/K of the states and can eliminate those from the states it has in it’s buffer.\nIf you are working with RL agents and more so if you are using deep RL avoid the methodological trap of using the referential Lewis signaling game as a stand in for the simple Lewis signaling game as you are using Deep RL or Dynamic Programming to solve an O(N) coordination problem rather which is overkill and not a particularly impressive result.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2025,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {The {Referential} {Lewis} {Signaling} {Game}},\n  date = {2025-01-14},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2025/2025-03-09-referential-lewis-game/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2025. “The Referential Lewis Signaling\nGame.” January 14, 2025. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2025/2025-03-09-referential-lewis-game/.",

    "text": "Today I want to consider a couple of weak assumption about planning in the Complex Lewis game. It seems that before I do I ought to revisit the basic form of the Lewis Signaling game and the referential version of the game and the complex version of the game, and how these are formalized in Game Theory and in Reinforcement Learning. This is perhaps an onerous detour but it might be useful to help make progress that the weak assumptions I want to consider.\nTo avoid confusion lets state these assumptions up front. Lets code the function that maps the states to singals as e for endoing and the function that maps the signals to states as d for decoding.\nIn the Lewis signaling game, the sender and receiver have to coordinate their actions to maximize their reward. The sender has to choose a signal that will help the receiver identify the correct state. The receiver has to interpret the signal and choose the correct state. This requires planning and coordination between the two agents.\nWe could consider these as different lexicons. In a bayesian settings we might go further and consider that there are N! senders each with a different lexicon and that the receiver must infer type of sender rather than the the correct signal for the current state.\nIf the sender picks a lexicon for n\n:::\nThe state space can be simple or structured and anything in between. If the state space is simple the sender will use the original Lewis game to create a lexicon. If the state space is structured the sender and receiver may do better - particularly if the number of simple signals is smaller than the number of states and sequences of signals must be used.\nIf the state space is a list of binary fields then the sender can use a fixed template of length n and two signals encodeing on or off. If the Planning in the Lewis game is a complex problem\nIt seems a daunting task to plan the whole language when presented with say the first state or perhaps a million states. We can assume from the game theoretic nature of the Lewis Game that the sender and receivers know the full states space even if not the distribution of states. I say this because how could the receiver know from what options to respond to the sender if it did not know the full state space.\nIn the referential game the receiver only seed a few states and must infer the right one from the signal. In this case we may relax the previous assumption and say that the sender and receiver may have a partial view of the state space.",

    "text": "What is Off-Policy Learning ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: On-policy learning - In a nutshell\n\n\n\n\noff-policy learning\n\nIs like trying to learn to play basketball by watching a game of football.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s call the sum of all decisions we learn a policy. Now let’s try and make this definition more general. We want to learn a policy that is different from the policy that generated the data. Here the data is the actions chosen by the players in the game we watched.\nTo avoid confusion, we call the policy that generated the data the behavior policy, because that is how the players behaved in the game.\nAnd the policy we want to learn, we call the target policy because that is the policy we want to target.\n\nOff-policy learning\n\nIs a Reinforcement Learning technique where the agent learns from a behavior policy that is different from the target policy.\n\n\nThis is useful in reinforcement learning when the agent needs to learning from historical data or from a different agent.",

    "text": "TL-DR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper “Scaling in financial prices: II. Multifractals and the star equation” (Mandelbrot 2001) Mandelbrot continus his exploration of financial price scaling. He focuses on refining and extending the mathematical model of Cauchy’s “star equation,” which describes the distribution of financial prices. The paper progresses from Cauchy’s original equation, limited to power-law distributions with an exponent α less than 2, to Mandelbrot’s multifractal generalization, allowing for 1 &lt; α &lt; ∞. This extension incorporates multifractal dependence, moving beyond the assumption of independence inherent in Cauchy’s model. The paper concludes by presenting a new model, Multifractal Products of Cylindrical Pulses (MPCP), offering a more realistic and flexible approach to modeling financial price fluctuations, and supporting the observation that financial data exhibit multifractal behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot, B. B. 2001. “Scaling in Financial Prices: II. Multifractals and the Star Equation.” Quantitative Finance 1 (1): 124–30. https://doi.org/10.1080/713665540.\nScaling in financial prices in a nutshell\n\n\n\nThis paper reviews the evolution of Mandelbrot’s model for understanding financial price fluctuations, transitioning from his early work in 1963 based on stable distributions with independent increments to the more recent multifractal model with dependent increments.\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of the Gaussian Model and Stable Distributions: Early models based on the Gaussian distribution (and later, stable distributions with α &lt; 2) fail to capture the observed high variability in financial data. Specifically, the restriction of α &lt; 2 for stable distributions cannot explain empirical findings of power-law distributions with exponents greater than 2.\n\n\n“Many writers concluded that, whenever data yield α &gt; 2, scaling is inadequate and should be abandoned. My alternative proposal is to foresake independence and generalize scaling into multiscaling.”\n\n\nIntroduction of Multifractality: Mandelbrot proposes the multifractal model as a solution to the limitations of previous models. This model incorporates dependent increments and can generate power-law distributions with exponents α &gt; 2, aligning with empirical observations.\n\n\n\\sum_{n=1}^{b} W_n X_n \\equiv \\widetilde{W}(W_1, W_2, \\ldots, W_b) X\n\nwhere ≡ denotes identity in distribution\n\n\\varphi^n(s)= \\varphi[\\widetilde{W}(n)s]\n\n\nThe Star Equation: Both the Gaussian and the multifractal model can be represented by a “star equation,” a functional equation that describes the self-similarity and scaling properties of the underlying process. The key difference lies in the nature of the weights in the equation:\n\nGaussian: Non-random weights, leading to α &lt; 2.\nMultifractal: Random weights, allowing for 1 &lt; α &lt; ∞.\n\nCascades and the Multifractal Star Equation: The concept of multiplicative cascades provides a concrete mechanism for generating multifractal measures. Within this framework, the “canonical” cascade, characterized by independent random weights, emerges as the most relevant for financial modeling.\n\n\n“The canonical cascade can be rationalized by assuming that investigating a financial time series by itself amounts to extracting a linear cross section from that full system. As section 6 will elaborate, multiplication by a weight is meant to model the effects of a cause.”\n\n\nBeyond Cascades: MPCP (Multifractal Products of Cylindrical Pulses): Mandelbrot argues that the restriction to b-adic grids in cascade models is artificial. He introduces the MPCP model, where cylindrical pulses are distributed randomly, further generalizing the multifractal framework and reinforcing the prevalence of q_{crit} &lt; ∞ (leading to power-law distributions with α &gt; 1).\n\n\n“The sequence from ‘microcanonical’ to ‘canonical’ and on to MPCP, teaches several lessons. As the processes’ randomness becomes increasingly unconstrained, q_{crit} &lt; ∞ becomes an increasingly general rule with increasingly special exceptions.”\n\n\nEmpirical Validation: Mandelbrot references empirical studies (Calvet and Fisher 2001, Mandelbrot, Calvet, and Fisher 1997) demonstrating the good fit of the multifractal model to financial data, particularly highlighting the multifractal nature of the Deutschmark/US Dollar exchange rate.\nConclusion: While acknowledging that the multifractal model is not definitive, Mandelbrot advocates for its potential in capturing the complexity and high variability observed in financial markets, offering a more realistic assessment of risk compared to traditional Brownian motion-based models. He also suggests that the concepts developed in finance, like the distinction between mild, slow, and wild randomness, could be valuable in other scientific domains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the “star equation” and why is it important in the context of financial models?\nThe star equation is a functional equation that describes how the distribution of a random variable changes when it is summed or multiplied by random weights. It plays a crucial role in understanding scaling properties in various phenomena, including financial price fluctuations. The solutions to the star equation can help us understand how asset returns are distributed, especially when those returns exhibit fat tails.\nHow does the Gaussian distribution relate to the star equation?\nThe Gaussian distribution is a solution to the star equation when the weights are non-random and independent. This implies that the sum of independent Gaussian random variables with non-random weights will also follow a Gaussian distribution. However, this solution only works when a key parameter, often labeled as α, is less than 2.\nWhy is the limitation of α &lt; 2 in traditional financial models a problem?\nThe restriction α &lt; 2 implies that price changes can only be modeled with distributions that have finite variance. However, empirical data from financial markets often show that price changes have fat tails, implying infinite variance and a higher probability of extreme events than predicted by a Gaussian distribution. This makes traditional models inadequate for accurately capturing market risks.\nHow do multifractals address the limitations of traditional models based on the Gaussian distribution?\nMultifractals introduce random weights into the star equation, generalizing it to account for the complex dependencies and scaling properties observed in financial data. This generalization allows for solutions with α &gt; 2, capturing the fat tails and intermittent bursts of volatility characteristic of financial time series.\nWhat is the key difference between “uniscaling” and “multiscaling” behavior?\n\nUniscaling processes, like standard Brownian motion, exhibit the same scaling behavior across all time scales. Their statistical properties are self-similar, meaning they look the same when viewed at different zoom levels.\nMultiscaling processes, like financial time series, exhibit different scaling behaviors at different time scales. Their statistical properties are more complex and cannot be described by a single scaling exponent.\n\nWhat is q_{crit} and why is it significant in multifractal models?\nq_{crit} is a critical exponent that emerges in multifractal models when the function τ(q), which describes the scaling of moments of the distribution, becomes negative for values of q greater than q_{crit}. This signifies a power law behavior in the distribution with an exponent related to q_{crit}. The existence of a finite q_{crit} indicates that the distribution has fat tails and infinite moments, consistent with the empirical observations of financial returns.\nHow does the concept of “cylindrical pulses” contribute to the development of multifractal models?\n“Cylindrical pulses” offer a way to move beyond the limitations of traditional cascade models. By randomly distributing these pulses across various scales, the models can capture the intermittent and clustered nature of volatility in financial markets. This approach leads to a more flexible and realistic framework for modeling multifractal behavior.\nWhat are the practical implications of using multifractal models in finance?\nMultifractal models provide a more accurate representation of financial risks compared to traditional models. This can lead to better risk management strategies, more realistic pricing of financial instruments, and improved portfolio optimization techniques that account for the possibility of extreme market events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nWhat is the fundamental limitation of Cauchy’s star equation in relation to the scaling exponent α?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nCauchy’s star equation, when combined with the assumption of independence, restricts the scaling exponent α to be less than 2. This limitation arises from the fact that the Fourier transform of the characteristic function for α &gt; 2 fails to be a valid probability density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nWhy did Mandelbrot propose moving beyond the Gaussian framework and introduce multifractals in financial modeling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot introduced multifractals to address the limitations of the Gaussian framework, specifically the restriction of α &lt; 2, which is often contradicted by empirical observations of financial data exhibiting higher scaling exponents. Multifractals allow for dependence and a broader range of scaling behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of ‘base-bound’ vs. ‘base-free’ in the context of the star equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nA ‘base-bound’ star equation holds only for a specific base b, while a ‘base-free’ equation holds irrespective of the chosen base. The latter is preferable due to its greater generality, but the former is often easier to generalize in the context of multifractals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\nWhat is the key difference between the microcanonical and canonical multiplicative cascades?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrocanonical cascades strictly conserve mass at each stage, ensuring that the total mass remains constant. Canonical cascades, however, only conserve mass on average, allowing for greater flexibility and randomness in the distribution of mass within the cascade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nWhy is the quantity Ω (measure of the interval [0, 1]) significant in the context of multifractal cascades?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nΩ represents the total measure of the interval [0, 1] after the cascade process. It is significant because it can exhibit a power-law distribution with a critical exponent qcrit, indicating the presence of multifractality. The distribution of Ω provides insights into the scaling properties of the measure generated by the cascade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nWhat condition leads to the existence of a finite critical exponent qcrit in multifractal cascades?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe existence of a finite qcrit arises when the function τ(q) crosses zero for a value of q greater than 1. This condition implies that the moments of Ω become infinite for q &gt; qcrit, leading to a power-law distribution. This phenomenon is more likely in canonical cascades where the weights are not strictly bound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nHow does the concept of ‘cylindrical pulses’ help in extending the multifractal model beyond b-adic cascades?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe special cases are:\nCylindrical pulses offer a way to generalize multifractal models beyond the limitations of b-adic grids. By representing the multiplicative weights as pulses randomly distributed across the interval, the model becomes less restrictive and allows for more realistic scenarios where the number of influencing factors varies across different scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the function τ(q) in characterizing multifractal measures?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nτ(q) is a key function in multifractal theory as it encapsulates the scaling properties of the measure. It relates the moments of the measure to the size of the intervals. The behavior of τ(q), particularly whether it becomes negative for certain values of q, determines the existence and value of the critical exponent qcrit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nWhy does Mandelbrot argue that the generic situation for financial time series is likely to be characterized by q_{crit} &lt; ∞?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot argues that financial time series are likely to exhibit qcrit &lt; ∞ because they represent a cross-section of a much larger and complex economic system. The lack of strict conservation of influences within this system makes the canonical cascade model with independent weights a more appropriate representation, leading to the possibility of qcrit &lt; ∞.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nWhat advantage does the multifractal model offer over the Brownian motion model in financial modeling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multifractal model, particularly when incorporating fractional Brownian motion in multifractal time, provides a more realistic representation of financial market behavior compared to the Brownian motion model. It captures the observed long tails, volatility clustering, and scaling properties of price changes, leading to a better assessment of portfolio risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast Cauchy’s star equation and the multifractal star equation. Discuss their underlying assumptions, solutions, and implications for modeling financial data.\nExplain the concept of multifractality in detail. Discuss the different types of multiplicative cascades and their role in generating multifractal measures. Provide examples of how multifractality manifests in financial time series.\nAnalyze the significance of the critical exponent qcrit in multifractal models. Explain how the value of qcrit affects the distribution of the measure and its moments. Discuss the conditions under which qcrit is finite and its implications for understanding the behavior of financial markets\nDiscuss the limitations of b-adic cascade models and explain how the concept of cylindrical pulses helps in overcoming those limitations. Describe the Multifractal Product of Cylindrical Pulses (MPCP) process and its key properties. Explain how MPCP allows for a wider range of multifractal behavior compared to traditional cascade models.\nEvaluate the strengths and weaknesses of using multifractal models to represent financial markets. Compare and contrast the multifractal approach with other alternative models. Discuss the empirical evidence supporting the use of multifractals in finance and the potential benefits they offer for risk management and portfolio optimization.\n\n\n\n\nScaling: A property of objects or processes where their statistical properties remain invariant under changes of scale.\n\nMultifractal\n\nA generalization of fractals that exhibit different scaling properties at different scales.\n\nStar Equation\n\nA functional equation that relates the distribution of a random variable to the sum of scaled and weighted copies of itself.\n\nCauchy’s Star Equation\n\nA base-free star equation that admits stable distributions with scaling exponents α between 0 and 2.\n\nMultifractal Star Equation\n\nA generalized star equation that incorporates random weights and allows for scaling exponents α greater than 2.\n\nMultiplicative Cascade\n\nA process that generates a multifractal measure by successively subdividing an interval and assigning random weights to each subinterval.\n\nMicrocanonical Cascade\n\nA type of multiplicative cascade that strictly conserves mass at each stage.\n\nCanonical Cascade\n\nA type of multiplicative cascade that conserves mass on average, allowing for greater flexibility and randomness in the distribution of mass.\n\nCylindrical Pulse\n\nA function that is constant except in a specific interval, representing a localized multiplicative weight in a multifractal model.\n\nMPCP\n\nMultifractal Product of Cylindrical Pulses, a generalization of cascade models that uses randomly distributed cylindrical pulses to generate multifractal measures with less restrictive scaling properties.\n\nτ(q)\n\nThe scaling exponent function that relates the moments of a multifractal measure to the size of the intervals. Its behavior determines the existence and value of the critical exponent\n\nq_{crit}\n\nThe critical exponent that characterizes the power-law distribution of a multifractal measure.

By representing the multiplicative weights as pulses randomly distributed across the interval, the model becomes less restrictive and allows for more realistic scenarios where the number of influencing factors varies across different scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the function τ(q) in characterizing multifractal measures?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nτ(q) is a key function in multifractal theory as it encapsulates the scaling properties of the measure. It relates the moments of the measure to the size of the intervals. The behavior of τ(q), particularly whether it becomes negative for certain values of q, determines the existence and value of the critical exponent qcrit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nWhy does Mandelbrot argue that the generic situation for financial time series is likely to be characterized by q_{crit} &lt; ∞?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot argues that financial time series are likely to exhibit qcrit &lt; ∞ because they represent a cross-section of a much larger and complex economic system. The lack of strict conservation of influences within this system makes the canonical cascade model with independent weights a more appropriate representation, leading to the possibility of qcrit &lt; ∞.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nWhat advantage does the multifractal model offer over the Brownian motion model in financial modeling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multifractal model, particularly when incorporating fractional Brownian motion in multifractal time, provides a more realistic representation of financial market behavior compared to the Brownian motion model.

    "text": "“In the Brownian model, such a high level of concentration has a probability so minute that it should never happen. Unfortunately for the model, it happens every decade.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL-DR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper “Scaling in financial prices: III. IV. Multifractal concentration” (Mandelbrot 2001) Mandelbrot explores the concept of concentration in financial price variations, moving beyond the limitations of traditional Brownian motion models.\nIt introduces and contrasts three states of concentration: absent (as in Brownian motion), hard (as in the author’s earlier mesofractal model), and soft (the novel multifractal model).\nMandelbrot argues that the multifractal model, characterized by a tunable exponent D, offers a more realistic representation of financial data by capturing a “soft” concentration where a small proportion of days accounts for a significant portion of overall variance, unlike the unrealistic extremes of the other models. The paper uses mathematical analysis, simulations, and visual representations to illustrate the properties of multifractal concentration and its advantages over existing models. It highlights the importance of understanding concentration for accurately modeling and predicting financial market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot, B. B. 2001. “Scaling in Financial Prices: IV. Multifractal Concentration.” Quantitative Finance 1 (6): 641–49. https://doi.org/10.1088/1469-7688/1/6/306.\nScaling in financial prices in a nutshell\n“The multifractals provide a new ‘in-between’ scenario that is intermediate between the familiar scenarios exemplified above.” “Soft concentration can be ‘tuned’ to fall anywhere between the unacceptable extremes of absent or hard concentration.”\n\n\n\n\n\n– Critique of the Brownian Model in Finance: The Brownian model, with its assumption of independent and normally distributed price changes, fails to account for the observed concentration of price variation in real financial markets. This model predicts “absent concentration”, where each day’s contribution to overall price change is negligible. - Introduction of Multifractal Concentration: Mandelbrot proposes an alternative model, the “multifractal model”, which incorporates long-range dependence and non-Gaussian distributions. This model predicts a “soft” form of concentration, where a significant portion of price variation is concentrated in a relatively small number of days, characterized by the fractal dimension D. - Comparison with Mesofractal Model: The earlier “mesofractal model” proposed by Mandelbrot in 1963 also addressed concentration but predicted a more extreme “hard” concentration, where a single day could account for a substantial portion of price change. This is deemed unrealistic in the long run.\n\n“Multifractal concentration consists in the fact that D &lt; 1.” “The multifractal model introduces a very different and new form of concentration that will be called ‘soft’, ‘relative’ or ‘multifractal’.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical Evidence of Concentration: Mandelbrot highlights real-world examples demonstrating concentrated price variation. For instance, “Of the portfolio’s positive returns over the 1980s, fully 40% was earned during ten days, about 0.5% of the number of trading days in a decade.” Such extreme concentration is highly improbable under the Brownian model.\nThree States of Concentration: The paper distinguishes between “absent”, “hard”, and “soft” concentration. The Brownian model exemplifies absent concentration, the mesofractal model hard concentration, and the multifractal model soft concentration. Fractal Dimension D: The exponent D in the multifractal model quantifies the degree of concentration. As D increases from 0 to 1, concentration softens, approaching the Brownian case (D = 1) where concentration is absent.\nRole of Global Dependence: The multifractal model’s soft concentration stems from the strong long-range dependence in price changes, invalidating the standard theory of extreme values applicable to independent variables.\nMultifractal Trading Time: The multifractal model can be visualized as Brownian motion occurring in a “multifractal trading time”, where time intervals are stretched or compressed in a fractal manner, leading to periods of high and low volatility.\nApplication of Variance: While variance is not an ideal measure of volatility in fractal models, the paper justifies its use for analyzing concentration due to its link with Brownian motion and ease of calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\nInability to fully predict power-law tails: The cartoons, being based on multinomial cascades, struggle to accurately represent the long-tailed distributions observed in real financial data.\nCoupling of H and multifractal time: Unlike their continuous-time counterparts, the cartoon models impose a dependence between the Hölder exponent (H) and the multifractal time.\nSingular perturbation in mesofractal cartoons: The specific construction of the mesofractal cartoons introduces an undesirable singular perturbation, highlighting a limitation of the three-interval symmetric generators.\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot argues that the multifractal model, with its concept of soft concentration, provides a more realistic framework for understanding the complex dynamics of financial markets compared to the traditional Brownian model. The fractal dimension D offers a tunable parameter to capture varying degrees of concentration observed in different markets or time scales. The paper sets the stage for further exploration of multifractal concentration and its implications for risk management, portfolio optimization, and other financial applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is “concentration” in the context of financial price changes?\nConcentration refers to the phenomenon where a significant proportion of the overall price change over a given period is attributed to a relatively small number of trading days. In other words, a few large price movements contribute disproportionately to the total variation.\nHow does concentration differ in the Brownian model, the mesofractal model, and the multifractal model?\n\nBrownian model: This model predicts “absent” concentration, meaning each day’s contribution to the overall price change is negligible.\nMesofractal model: This model exhibits “hard” concentration, where a few of the largest daily price changes account for a significant portion of the total change, regardless of the total number of trading days.\nMultifractal model: This model proposes “soft” concentration. While individual large price changes are asymptotically negligible, a substantial proportion of the total change is concentrated in a number of days of the order of ND, where N is the total number of days and D is a fractal dimension (0 &lt; D &lt; 1).\n\nWhat causes concentration in these models?\n\nBrownian Model: No concentration exists because price changes are assumed to be IID - independent and identically distributed.\nMesofractal Model: Concentration arises from the heavy tails of the Lévy stable distributions used to model price changes. These heavy tails allow for a higher probability of extreme events.\nMultifractal Model: Concentration stems from long-range dependence in the data. While individual large price changes are negligible, the clustering of smaller yet significant changes within specific periods contributes to the overall concentration.\n\nWhy is the study of concentration important for understanding financial markets?\nConcentration challenges the traditional assumption that daily price changes are negligible and highlights the importance of extreme events in shaping market dynamics. Understanding concentration helps in:\n\nRisk management: Accurately assessing the probability and impact of large price swings is crucial for managing risk in financial portfolios.\nVolatility modeling: Traditional volatility measures based on variance might not adequately capture the risk associated with concentrated price changes.\nDeveloping more realistic market models: Incorporating concentration into financial models leads to a more accurate representation of market behavior and better predictions.\n\nWhat is “multifractal trading time”?\nMultifractal trading time is a concept used in the multifractal model to describe the non-linear relationship between clock time and the rate at which information flows and impacts price changes. It suggests that markets experience periods of intense activity (high information flow) interspersed with periods of relative calm, leading to an uneven distribution of price volatility over time.\nHow does the fractal dimension D affect the level of concentration in the multifractal model?\nThe fractal dimension D is a measure of the irregularity and clustering of price volatility in the multifractal model. A lower value of D indicates stronger concentration, meaning a larger proportion of the total price change is concentrated in a smaller fraction of trading days. Conversely, a higher D implies weaker concentration, closer to the Brownian model’s uniform distribution of volatility.\nWhat are the limitations of using variance as a measure of volatility in the context of multifractal concentration?\nVariance, which relies on the assumption of asymptotic negligibility of individual price changes, might not be an appropriate measure of volatility when dealing with multifractal concentration. This is because it can underestimate the risk associated with the clustering of significant price movements within specific periods. Alternative measures that account for the long-range dependence and heavy tails of the data might be needed.\nWhat are the implications of multifractal concentration for practical applications in finance?\nMultifractal concentration has significant implications for:\n\nPortfolio optimization: Diversification strategies might need to be adjusted to consider the potential impact of concentrated price changes on portfolio performance.\nOption pricing: Models need to incorporate the non-uniform distribution of volatility over time to accurately price options.\nAlgorithmic trading: Trading algorithms should be designed to adapt to periods of high and low volatility clustering to avoid excessive losses or missed opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nWhat is the fundamental difference in how the Brownian model and the mesofractal model view the contribution of daily price changes to overall variance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brownian model posits that each daily price change contributes negligibly to the overall variance, leading to “absent” concentration. Conversely, the mesofractal model proposes that a small number of large price changes contribute significantly to the variance, resulting in “hard” concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nDescribe “hard” concentration in the context of financial price changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Hard” concentration refers to the phenomenon where a significant proportion of the overall variance in financial price changes is attributed to a very small and fixed number of large price movements, regardless of the total number of days considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nWhy is the traditional concept of an “outlier” potentially problematic when analyzing financial data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of an “outlier” implies that extreme events are extraneous to the system being studied. In finance, however, large price changes may be intrinsic to market dynamics and carry essential information, thus dismissing them as outliers could lead to an incomplete understanding of price behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\nWhat key characteristic distinguishes “soft” concentration from “hard” concentration?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Soft” concentration, unlike “hard” concentration, asserts that while the largest individual price changes might be negligible, a substantial portion of the overall variance can be attributed to a proportionally smaller number of days as the total number of days increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nExplain the role of the fractal dimension, D, in the concept of “soft” concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fractal dimension, D, in “soft” concentration, quantifies the rate at which the number of days contributing significantly to the variance increases with the total number of days (N). A D value between 0 and 1 indicates that the number of significant days increases as ND, allowing for a flexible range of concentration levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nHow does the multifractal model challenge the standard theory of extreme values in probability theory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multifractal model, due to the strong dependence among price changes, invalidates the standard theory of extreme values, which assumes independence. A different theoretical framework, stemming from multifractal measures, is required to analyze extremes in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nWhat is “trading time” in the context of the multifractal model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trading time” (θ(t)) in the multifractal model is a non-linear transformation of clock time (t). It represents a distorted time scale where the frequency of large price changes is amplified, leading to the observed bursts of volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nBriefly describe the construction of the Bernoulli binomial measure, highlighting its key parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bernoulli binomial measure is constructed recursively by dividing an interval into halves and assigning masses (m0 and m1 = 1-m0) to each half. This process is repeated for each subsequent half, resulting in a highly uneven distribution of mass across the interval. The key parameter, m0, determines the degree of this unevenness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the coarse Hölder exponent, α(t), in understanding multifractal measures?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coarse Hölder exponent, α(t), quantifies the local scaling behavior of a multifractal measure at a point t. It provides a measure of the singularity or concentration of the measure around that point. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nExplain the relationship between the function f(α) and the concept of box dimension in fractal geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function f(α) maps the coarse Hölder exponent (α) to its corresponding fractal dimension. This function characterizes the multifractal spectrum, revealing the range of scaling exponents and their associated dimensions within the measure. The maximum value of f(α) typically represents the box dimension of the support of the measure, i.e., the set where the measure is concentrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast “absent,” “hard,” and “soft” concentration in the context of financial price changes. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model in capturing the empirical realities of market fluctuations.\nExplain how the concept of “trading time” helps the multifractal model capture the clustering and bursts of volatility observed in financial markets. Discuss the implications of this concept for risk management and portfolio allocation strategies.\nCritically evaluate the use of variance as a measure of volatility in financial markets. Discuss how the insights from the multifractal model challenge the traditional reliance on variance and suggest alternative measures that might be more appropriate.\nDiscuss the conceptual shift from viewing extreme price movements as “outliers” to recognizing them as integral parts of market dynamics. How does the multifractal model facilitate this shift, and what are its implications for our understanding of financial risk?\nExplain how the Bernoulli binomial measure serves as a simple yet powerful model for understanding the key features of multifractality. Discuss its limitations and potential extensions to more complex and realistic scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrownian Model\n\nA model of financial prices that assumes price changes are independent and identically distributed, following a normal distribution. This model results in “absent” concentration.\n\nMesofractal Model\n\nA model of financial prices that utilizes Lévy stable distributions, leading to “hard” concentration, where a few large price changes dominate the overall variance.\n\nMultifractal Model\n\nA model of financial prices that incorporates scaling and long-range dependence, resulting in “soft” concentration, where a proportionally smaller number of days contribute significantly to the variance as the total number of days increases.\n\nHard Concentration\n\nA form of concentration where a fixed and small number of large price changes account for a significant proportion of the overall variance.]\n\nSoft Concentration\n\nA form of concentration where the number of days contributing significantly to the variance increases as a power law of the total number of days, with the exponent being a fractal dimension between 0 and 1.\n\nFractal Dimension (D)\n\nAn exponent that characterizes the scaling behavior of a fractal object or process. In the context of multifractal concentration, it quantifies the rate at which the number of significant days increases with the total number of days.\n\nTrading Time (θ(t))\n\nA non-linear transformation of clock time used in the multifractal model to account for the clustering and bursts of volatility observed in financial markets.\n\nCoarse Hölder Exponent (α(t))\n\nA measure of the local scaling behavior of a multifractal measure at a point t, indicating the singularity or concentration of the measure around that point.\n\nf(α)\n\nA function that maps the coarse Hölder exponent to its corresponding fractal dimension, characterizing the multifractal spectrum of the measure.\n\nBox Dimension\n\nA type of fractal dimension that quantifies the scaling of the number of boxes needed to cover a set as the box size decreases. In the context of multifractals, it often corresponds to the dimension of the support of the measure.\n\nOutlier\n\nAn observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample. In finance, large price changes are often misclassified as outliers.",

Conversely, the mesofractal model proposes that a small number of large price changes contribute significantly to the variance, resulting in “hard” concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nDescribe “hard” concentration in the context of financial price changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Hard” concentration refers to the phenomenon where a significant proportion of the overall variance in financial price changes is attributed to a very small and fixed number of large price movements, regardless of the total number of days considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nWhy is the traditional concept of an “outlier” potentially problematic when analyzing financial data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of an “outlier” implies that extreme events are extraneous to the system being studied. In finance, however, large price changes may be intrinsic to market dynamics and carry essential information, thus dismissing them as outliers could lead to an incomplete understanding of price behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\nWhat key characteristic distinguishes “soft” concentration from “hard” concentration?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Soft” concentration, unlike “hard” concentration, asserts that while the largest individual price changes might be negligible, a substantial portion of the overall variance can be attributed to a proportionally smaller number of days as the total number of days increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nExplain the role of the fractal dimension, D, in the concept of “soft” concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fractal dimension, D, in “soft” concentration, quantifies the rate at which the number of days contributing significantly to the variance increases with the total number of days (N). A D value between 0 and 1 indicates that the number of significant days increases as ND, allowing for a flexible range of concentration levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nHow does the multifractal model challenge the standard theory of extreme values in probability theory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multifractal model, due to the strong dependence among price changes, invalidates the standard theory of extreme values, which assumes independence. A different theoretical framework, stemming from multifractal measures, is required to analyze extremes in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nWhat is “trading time” in the context of the multifractal model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trading time” (θ(t)) in the multifractal model is a non-linear transformation of clock time (t). It represents a distorted time scale where the frequency of large price changes is amplified, leading to the observed bursts of volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nBriefly describe the construction of the Bernoulli binomial measure, highlighting its key parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bernoulli binomial measure is constructed recursively by dividing an interval into halves and assigning masses (m0 and m1 = 1-m0) to each half. This process is repeated for each subsequent half, resulting in a highly uneven distribution of mass across the interval. The key parameter, m0, determines the degree of this unevenness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the coarse Hölder exponent, α(t), in understanding multifractal measures?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coarse Hölder exponent, α(t), quantifies the local scaling behavior of a multifractal measure at a point t. It provides a measure of the singularity or concentration of the measure around that point. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nExplain the relationship between the function f(α) and the concept of box dimension in fractal geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function f(α) maps the coarse Hölder exponent (α) to its corresponding fractal dimension. This function characterizes the multifractal spectrum, revealing the range of scaling exponents and their associated dimensions within the measure. The maximum value of f(α) typically represents the box dimension of the support of the measure, i.e., the set where the measure is concentrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast “absent,” “hard,” and “soft” concentration in the context of financial price changes. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model in capturing the empirical realities of market fluctuations.\nExplain how the concept of “trading time” helps the multifractal model capture the clustering and bursts of volatility observed in financial markets. Discuss the implications of this concept for risk management and portfolio allocation strategies.\nCritically evaluate the use of variance as a measure of volatility in financial markets. Discuss how the insights from the multifractal model challenge the traditional reliance on variance and suggest alternative measures that might be more appropriate.\nDiscuss the conceptual shift from viewing extreme price movements as “outliers” to recognizing them as integral parts of market dynamics. How does the multifractal model facilitate this shift, and what are its implications for our understanding of financial risk?\nExplain how the Bernoulli binomial measure serves as a simple yet powerful model for understanding the key features of multifractality. Discuss its limitations and potential extensions to more complex and realistic scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrownian Model\n\nA model of financial prices that assumes price changes are independent and identically distributed, following a normal distribution. This model results in “absent” concentration.\n\nMesofractal Model\n\nA model of financial prices that utilizes Lévy stable distributions, leading to “hard” concentration, where a few large price changes dominate the overall variance.\n\nMultifractal Model\n\nA model of financial prices that incorporates scaling and long-range dependence, resulting in “soft” concentration, where a proportionally smaller number of days contribute significantly to the variance as the total number of days increases.\n\nHard Concentration\n\nA form of concentration where a fixed and small number of large price changes account for a significant proportion of the overall variance.]\n\nSoft Concentration\n\nA form of concentration where the number of days contributing significantly to the variance increases as a power law of the total number of days, with the exponent being a fractal dimension between 0 and 1.\n\nFractal Dimension (D)\n\nAn exponent that characterizes the scaling behavior of a fractal object or process. In the context of multifractal concentration, it quantifies the rate at which the number of significant days increases with the total number of days.\n\nTrading Time (θ(t))\n\nA non-linear transformation of clock time used in the multifractal model to account for the clustering and bursts of volatility observed in financial markets.\n\nCoarse Hölder Exponent (α(t))\n\nA measure of the local scaling behavior of a multifractal measure at a point t, indicating the singularity or concentration of the measure around that point.\n\nf(α)\n\nA function that maps the coarse Hölder exponent to its corresponding fractal dimension, characterizing the multifractal spectrum of the measure.\n\nBox Dimension\n\nA type of fractal dimension that quantifies the scaling of the number of boxes needed to cover a set as the box size decreases. In the context of multifractals, it often corresponds to the dimension of the support of the measure.\n\nOutlier\n\nAn observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample. In finance, large price changes are often misclassified as outliers.",

    "text": "“The ideal market completely disregards those spikes—but a realistic model cannot.” Mandelbrot highlights the inadequacy of models ignoring extreme price movements, emphasizing the need for a framework that can accommodate them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL-DR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper “Scaling in financial prices: I. Tails and dependence” (Mandelbrot 2001) Mandelbrot surveys his research on modeling financial price fluctuations. Mandelbrot challenges the traditional Brownian motion model, arguing that financial data exhibits “fat tails” and long-range dependence, better captured by his multi-fractal model. He introduces the “star equation,” a mathematical framework expressing scaling invariance in financial prices. The paper presents graphical evidence supporting his claims and contrasts his models with traditional approaches, emphasizing the importance of considering both short-term and long-term data simultaneously. Finally, he discusses the implications for risk assessment and diversification strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelbrot, B. B. 2001. “Scaling in Financial Prices: I. Tails and Dependence.” Quantitative Finance 1 (1): 113–23. https://doi.org/10.1080/713665539.\nScaling in financial prices in a nutshell\n\n\n\n\nNon-Gaussianity of financial price changes: Empirical evidence strongly suggests that price changes are not normally distributed, exhibiting “fat tails” with a higher frequency of extreme events than predicted by the standard Brownian motion model.\nScaling and self-affinity: Financial price series exhibit similar patterns across different time scales, a concept mathematically described as self-affinity. This suggests the presence of underlying rules governing price variations across various time horizons.\nLimitations of traditional models: Models assuming independent and identically distributed price changes with finite variance, like the Brownian motion model, fail to capture the observed characteristics of financial data, particularly extreme price swings and volatility clustering.\nMultifractality as a potential solution: The concept of multifractality, which incorporates both long-range dependence and scale invariance, offers a promising framework for modeling financial price variations more realistically.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical evidence of power laws: Studies reveal power-law distributions for both the tail probabilities of price changes (exponent α) and long-range dependence (exponent 2H-2).\n\nFat tails: Mandelbrot’s early work (1963) showed evidence of power-law tails in cotton prices, later confirmed by Fama (1965) for a broader range of securities. These findings challenged the Gaussian assumption of price changes.\nInfinite dependence: The Hurst puzzle highlighted long-range dependence in price series, suggesting that price changes are not independent. Mandelbrot (1965) proposed a power law to describe this dependence.\n\nChallenges to traditional scaling: Officer (1972) demonstrated deviations from scaling in financial data when applying the collapse test across different time increments, questioning the validity of models like Mandelbrot’s 1963 model based on Lévy stable distributions.\nStates of Variability and Randomness - Mandelbrot introduced this concept to categorize randomness into mild (Gaussian-like), slow (requiring adjustments for short-term behavior), and wild (exhibiting persistent non-Gaussianity across time scales). He argued that financial markets belong to the “wild” category.\nShortcomings of truncated power-law distributions: While some researchers have attempted to reconcile observed data with the Gaussian framework by truncating the tails of power-law distributions, this approach is criticized for being ad-hoc and destroying the scaling properties observed in financial markets.\nThe promise of multifractals: Mandelbrot proposed a model combining fractional Brownian motion and multifractal trading time to capture both long-range dependence and scale invariance in financial prices. This model has the potential to address the limitations of earlier models and provide a more accurate representation of financial market dynamics.\n\n\n“I disagree that non-stationarity is obvious and do my best to avoid it.” 1{.aside}\n1 This quote reflects Mandelbrot’s stance on the misleading emphasis on non-stationarity in financial data, advocating for the search for generalized forms of stationarity and corresponding models.\nWhat are the key limitations of existing financial models?\n\nTraditional models often assume that price changes are normally distributed, but empirical evidence suggests that this is not the case. [1] Financial prices tend to exhibit “fat tails,” meaning that extreme events are more common than a normal distribution would predict. [1, 2] This limitation is particularly important because models that fail to account for extreme price swings can be unreliable for risk management and other financial applications. [3]\nMany financial models assume that price changes are independent and identically distributed, but this is also not supported by the data. [4, 5] Financial prices often exhibit long-range dependence, meaning that past price changes can influence future price changes. [5] Mandelbrot referred to this as the “Hurst puzzle.” [5]\nSome researchers have tried to address these limitations by truncating the tails of power-law distributions, but this approach is problematic. [6] Truncating the tails can destroy the scaling properties observed in financial markets, leading to models that are not accurate. [6]\nMandelbrot argued that financial markets are “wildly variable” and that this variability cannot be ignored. [7] He suggested that models need to incorporate both long-range dependence and scale invariance to accurately capture financial market dynamics. [8]\nMultifractal models offer a promising approach to address these limitations. [8-10] These models combine fractional Brownian motion and multifractal trading time to capture both long-range dependence and scale invariance in financial prices. [8] However, more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of multifractal models and to develop practical applications. [11, 12]\n\n\n“Financial reality is not mildly variable even on the scale of a century. All things considered, one must adjust to the fact that financial reality is wildly variable. It would be totally unmanageable, unless there is some underlying property of invariance.” This quote underscores the persistent non-Gaussianity of financial data and the crucial need for finding an invariance principle to model this “wild” behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther exploration of multifractal models: Delve deeper into the mathematical framework of multifractals and their application to financial markets.\nEmpirical testing of multifractal models: Conduct rigorous statistical analysis to assess the effectiveness of multifractal models in capturing the observed properties of financial data.\nDeveloping practical applications: Explore the potential of multifractal models for risk management, portfolio optimization, and other practical applications in finance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main challenge in representing financial price variation through mathematical models?\nThe main challenge lies in capturing the complex and seemingly erratic behavior of financial prices over different time scales. Traditional models like Brownian motion struggle to accurately represent the large price fluctuations (“spikes”), periods of high volatility clustering, and long-term dependencies observed in real market data.\nHow does the concept of “scaling” address this challenge?\nScaling, in the context of financial markets, postulates that price patterns exhibit similar statistical properties across various time scales. This concept implies the existence of underlying rules governing price fluctuations, even if those rules may appear complex.\nWhat are the limitations of traditional models like Brownian motion in capturing the behavior of financial prices?\nBrownian motion assumes independent and normally distributed price changes. This assumption fails to account for the “fat tails” observed in actual price distributions, which indicate a higher probability of extreme events than predicted by a normal distribution. Additionally, Brownian motion does not address the clustering of volatility and long-range dependencies evident in real markets.\nWhat is the significance of the “Officer effect”?\nThe Officer effect refers to empirical observations demonstrating that the simple scaling properties assumed in early models like Mandelbrot’s 1963 model do not hold consistently across different time increments for various financial assets. This finding highlighted the need for more sophisticated models to capture the complexities of market behavior.\nWhat is meant by “states of variability and randomness” and how does this concept relate to financial modeling?\nMandelbrot proposed three states of variability and randomness: mild, slow, and wild. Mild randomness resembles the behavior of a gas, characterized by independent events and normal distributions, as exemplified by Brownian motion. Slow randomness, analogous to liquids, introduces some degree of dependence or “memory” in the system. Wild randomness, similar to solids, exhibits strong dependencies and large fluctuations, reflecting the reality of financial markets. Understanding these states is crucial for developing appropriate models and managing risk.\nWhat are the key features of Mandelbrot’s multifractal model for asset returns?\nMandelbrot’s multifractal model combines fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and multifractal trading time (MTT). This compound process allows for long-range dependence and captures the observed volatility clustering and fat tails in price distributions. Unlike earlier models, the multifractal model acknowledges the inherent “wild” randomness of financial markets.\nHow does the multifractal model address the limitations of previous models and account for empirical observations like the Officer effect?\nBy incorporating both FBM and MTT, the multifractal model accounts for the long-term dependencies and varying volatility observed in financial time series. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of price fluctuations over a wide range of time scales, thereby addressing the shortcomings of previous models that relied on assumptions of independence and normal distributions.\nWhat are the implications of the multifractal model for understanding and managing risk in financial markets?\nThe multifractal model highlights the presence of “wild” randomness in financial markets, implying that traditional risk management techniques based on normal distributions and independence assumptions may be inadequate. This model emphasizes the importance of considering the possibility of extreme events and the clustering of volatility when assessing and managing risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nWhat is the key question regarding the power-law distribution of financial price changes, and how does it relate to the concepts of independent increments and the multifractal model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key question is whether the exponent α in the power-law distribution is restricted to α &lt; 2, which is the case for independent increments as in the Lévy-stable model. The multifractal model allows for dependent increments and α &gt; 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the visual challenge presented by Figure 1, and why is it misleading to conclude that Brownian motion adequately represents actual price data based on this figure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1, showing price levels, makes different models and real data visually indistinguishable. It’s misleading to conclude Brownian motion is adequate because it only shows overall trends and hides crucial details about price change behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nHow does Figure 2 provide a clearer picture of price changes compared to Figure 1, and what key characteristics of real market data does it reveal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 plots daily price increments, highlighting significant differences between models and real data. It reveals key characteristics like spikes (large price changes), varying strip width (volatility) and spike clustering, absent in Brownian motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the ideal market hypothesis inadequate in capturing the true nature of financial markets, particularly concerning extreme price changes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal market hypothesis fails to account for extreme price changes (“spikes”), which are statistically improbable in a Gaussian framework but common in real markets. These events, though infrequent, contribute disproportionately to overall market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nWhat is the author’s perspective on the relationship between short- and long-term price variations, and how does this differ from the conventional approach?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author argues that price variations exhibit similar characteristics across different time scales, suggesting common underlying rules. This contrasts with the conventional view of separate models for different time horizons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of self-affinity and its significance in representing market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-affinity is a scaling property where a shape’s parts are scaled versions of the whole, but with different scaling factors for different dimensions. In market charts, this reflects the similarity of patterns at different time scales, albeit with adjusted price scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nDescribe the three special cases of the compound process BH[θ(t)] and how they relate to earlier financial models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe special cases are:\n\nBachelier model: H=1/2, θ(t)=t, resulting in standard Brownian motion;\nM1965 model: H≠1/2, θ(t)=t, yielding fractional Brownian motion;\nM1963 model: H=1/2, θ(t) is a stable subordinator, leading to a Lévy-stable process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nWhat is the key difference between subordination and general compounding in the context of the FBM (MTT) model, and what advantage does general compounding offer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSubordination uses only monotone, non-decreasing processes for θ(t), preserving independent increments. General compounding allows for dependent increments in θ(t), enabling the FBM(MTT) model to capture more complex and realistic price dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nHow does the concept of ‘states of variability and randomness’ contribute to understanding the varying effectiveness of risk reduction through diversification?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent ‘states of variability and randomness’ (mild, wild, slow) impact the effectiveness of risk reduction. Mild randomness allows for efficient averaging (e.g., diversification), while wild randomness, characterizing financial markets, can hinder or nullify this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nWhy does the author consider the search for transients towards Brownian motion a “thoroughly ill-conceived idea,” and what alternative approach does he propose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author argues that deviations from Brownian motion persist even at very large time scales, indicating that financial markets are inherently ‘wildly variable’.\nInstead of searching for convergence to the Brownian, he proposes seeking invariant properties within this ‘wildness’, leading to the multifractal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss the limitations of the traditional financial models based on Brownian motion and Gaussian distributions. How do these models fail to capture the empirical realities of financial markets, particularly in terms of extreme price changes and long-range dependence?\nExplain the concept of scaling and its role in the development of Mandelbrot’s models of financial price variation. Compare and contrast the scaling properties of the M1963, M1965, and M1972/1997 models.\nElaborate on the concept of multifractal trading time (MTT) and its significance in the M1972/1997 model. How does incorporating MTT allow for a more realistic representation of market volatility and price fluctuations?\nAnalyze the implications of the “Officer effect” for financial modeling. How did this empirical observation challenge the prevailing assumptions about scaling and lead to the development of more sophisticated approaches?\nDiscuss the concept of “states of variability and randomness” and its relevance to understanding risk and diversification in financial markets. How do the characteristics of “wild randomness” in financial data affect the effectiveness of traditional risk management techniques?\n\n\n\n\n\nPower-law distribution\n\nA probability distribution where the tail probabilities decay as a power of the variable. In financial markets, this refers to the distribution of price changes.\n\nIndependent increments\n\nA property of stochastic processes where increments over non-overlapping time intervals are statistically independent.\n\nMultifractal model\n\nA model of asset returns that incorporates both long-range dependence and fat tails in the distribution of price changes.\n\nBrownian motion\n\nA continuous-time stochastic process where increments are independent and normally distributed. Volatility: A measure of the dispersion of price changes over time.\n\nSelf-affinity\n\nA scaling property where parts of a shape are scaled versions of the whole, but with different scaling factors for different dimensions.\n\nFractional Brownian motion (FBM)\n\nA generalization of Brownian motion that allows for long-range dependence.\n\nMultifractal trading time (MTT)\n\nA non-linear transformation of clock time that accounts for the changing volatility in financial markets.\n\nSubordination\n\nA method of constructing a new stochastic process by replacing the time variable of an existing process with a new, independent process.\n\nGeneral compounding\n\nA more general method of combining two stochastic processes, allowing for dependence between the processes.\n\nStates of variability and randomness\n\nA categorization of randomness into mild, wild, and slow, reflecting the degree of structure and variability.\n\nOfficer effect\n\nEmpirical observation that the scaling properties of financial price changes vary with the time increment used to measure the changes.\n\nCritical moment exponent\n\nA parameter α that determines the highest moment of a distribution that is finite.",

    "text": "What is the main challenge in representing financial price variation through mathematical models?\nThe main challenge lies in capturing the complex and seemingly erratic behavior of financial prices over different time scales. Traditional models like Brownian motion struggle to accurately represent the large price fluctuations (“spikes”), periods of high volatility clustering, and long-term dependencies observed in real market data.\nHow does the concept of “scaling” address this challenge?\nScaling, in the context of financial markets, postulates that price patterns exhibit similar statistical properties across various time scales. This concept implies the existence of underlying rules governing price fluctuations, even if those rules may appear complex.\nWhat are the limitations of traditional models like Brownian motion in capturing the behavior of financial prices?\nBrownian motion assumes independent and normally distributed price changes. This assumption fails to account for the “fat tails” observed in actual price distributions, which indicate a higher probability of extreme events than predicted by a normal distribution. Additionally, Brownian motion does not address the clustering of volatility and long-range dependencies evident in real markets.\nWhat is the significance of the “Officer effect”?\nThe Officer effect refers to empirical observations demonstrating that the simple scaling properties assumed in early models like Mandelbrot’s 1963 model do not hold consistently across different time increments for various financial assets. This finding highlighted the need for more sophisticated models to capture the complexities of market behavior.\nWhat is meant by “states of variability and randomness” and how does this concept relate to financial modeling?\nMandelbrot proposed three states of variability and randomness: mild, slow, and wild. Mild randomness resembles the behavior of a gas, characterized by independent events and normal distributions, as exemplified by Brownian motion. Slow randomness, analogous to liquids, introduces some degree of dependence or “memory” in the system. Wild randomness, similar to solids, exhibits strong dependencies and large fluctuations, reflecting the reality of financial markets. Understanding these states is crucial for developing appropriate models and managing risk.\nWhat are the key features of Mandelbrot’s multifractal model for asset returns?\nMandelbrot’s multifractal model combines fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and multifractal trading time (MTT). This compound process allows for long-range dependence and captures the observed volatility clustering and fat tails in price distributions. Unlike earlier models, the multifractal model acknowledges the inherent “wild” randomness of financial markets.\nHow does the multifractal model address the limitations of previous models and account for empirical observations like the Officer effect?\nBy incorporating both FBM and MTT, the multifractal model accounts for the long-term dependencies and varying volatility observed in financial time series. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of price fluctuations over a wide range of time scales, thereby addressing the shortcomings of previous models that relied on assumptions of independence and normal distributions.\nWhat are the implications of the multifractal model for understanding and managing risk in financial markets?\nThe multifractal model highlights the presence of “wild” randomness in financial markets, implying that traditional risk management techniques based on normal distributions and independence assumptions may be inadequate. This model emphasizes the importance of considering the possibility of extreme events and the clustering of volatility when assessing and managing risk.",

    "text": "Instructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nWhat is the key question regarding the power-law distribution of financial price changes, and how does it relate to the concepts of independent increments and the multifractal model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key question is whether the exponent α in the power-law distribution is restricted to α &lt; 2, which is the case for independent increments as in the Lévy-stable model. The multifractal model allows for dependent increments and α &gt; 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the visual challenge presented by Figure 1, and why is it misleading to conclude that Brownian motion adequately represents actual price data based on this figure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1, showing price levels, makes different models and real data visually indistinguishable. It’s misleading to conclude Brownian motion is adequate because it only shows overall trends and hides crucial details about price change behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nHow does Figure 2 provide a clearer picture of price changes compared to Figure 1, and what key characteristics of real market data does it reveal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 plots daily price increments, highlighting significant differences between models and real data. It reveals key characteristics like spikes (large price changes), varying strip width (volatility) and spike clustering, absent in Brownian motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the ideal market hypothesis inadequate in capturing the true nature of financial markets, particularly concerning extreme price changes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal market hypothesis fails to account for extreme price changes (“spikes”), which are statistically improbable in a Gaussian framework but common in real markets. These events, though infrequent, contribute disproportionately to overall market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nWhat is the author’s perspective on the relationship between short- and long-term price variations, and how does this differ from the conventional approach?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author argues that price variations exhibit similar characteristics across different time scales, suggesting common underlying rules. This contrasts with the conventional view of separate models for different time horizons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of self-affinity and its significance in representing market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-affinity is a scaling property where a shape’s parts are scaled versions of the whole, but with different scaling factors for different dimensions. In market charts, this reflects the similarity of patterns at different time scales, albeit with adjusted price scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nDescribe the three special cases of the compound process BH[θ(t)] and how they relate to earlier financial models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe special cases are:\n\nBachelier model: H=1/2, θ(t)=t, resulting in standard Brownian motion;\nM1965 model: H≠1/2, θ(t)=t, yielding fractional Brownian motion;\nM1963 model: H=1/2, θ(t) is a stable subordinator, leading to a Lévy-stable process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nWhat is the key difference between subordination and general compounding in the context of the FBM (MTT) model, and what advantage does general compounding offer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSubordination uses only monotone, non-decreasing processes for θ(t), preserving independent increments. General compounding allows for dependent increments in θ(t), enabling the FBM(MTT) model to capture more complex and realistic price dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nHow does the concept of ‘states of variability and randomness’ contribute to understanding the varying effectiveness of risk reduction through diversification?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent ‘states of variability and randomness’ (mild, wild, slow) impact the effectiveness of risk reduction. Mild randomness allows for efficient averaging (e.g., diversification), while wild randomness, characterizing financial markets, can hinder or nullify this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nWhy does the author consider the search for transients towards Brownian motion a “thoroughly ill-conceived idea,” and what alternative approach does he propose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author argues that deviations from Brownian motion persist even at very large time scales, indicating that financial markets are inherently ‘wildly variable’.\nInstead of searching for convergence to the Brownian, he proposes seeking invariant properties within this ‘wildness’, leading to the multifractal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss the limitations of the traditional financial models based on Brownian motion and Gaussian distributions. How do these models fail to capture the empirical realities of financial markets, particularly in terms of extreme price changes and long-range dependence?\nExplain the concept of scaling and its role in the development of Mandelbrot’s models of financial price variation. Compare and contrast the scaling properties of the M1963, M1965, and M1972/1997 models.\nElaborate on the concept of multifractal trading time (MTT) and its significance in the M1972/1997 model. How does incorporating MTT allow for a more realistic representation of market volatility and price fluctuations?\nAnalyze the implications of the “Officer effect” for financial modeling. How did this empirical observation challenge the prevailing assumptions about scaling and lead to the development of more sophisticated approaches?\nDiscuss the concept of “states of variability and randomness” and its relevance to understanding risk and diversification in financial markets. How do the characteristics of “wild randomness” in financial data affect the effectiveness of traditional risk management techniques?\n\n\n\n\n\nPower-law distribution\n\nA probability distribution where the tail probabilities decay as a power of the variable. In financial markets, this refers to the distribution of price changes.\n\nIndependent increments\n\nA property of stochastic processes where increments over non-overlapping time intervals are statistically independent.\n\nMultifractal model\n\nA model of asset returns that incorporates both long-range dependence and fat tails in the distribution of price changes.\n\nBrownian motion\n\nA continuous-time stochastic process where increments are independent and normally distributed. Volatility: A measure of the dispersion of price changes over time.\n\nSelf-affinity\n\nA scaling property where parts of a shape are scaled versions of the whole, but with different scaling factors for different dimensions.\n\nFractional Brownian motion (FBM)\n\nA generalization of Brownian motion that allows for long-range dependence.\n\nMultifractal trading time (MTT)\n\nA non-linear transformation of clock time that accounts for the changing volatility in financial markets.\n\nSubordination\n\nA method of constructing a new stochastic process by replacing the time variable of an existing process with a new, independent process.\n\nGeneral compounding\n\nA more general method of combining two stochastic processes, allowing for dependence between the processes.\n\nStates of variability and randomness\n\nA categorization of randomness into mild, wild, and slow, reflecting the degree of structure and variability.\n\nOfficer effect\n\nEmpirical observation that the scaling properties of financial price changes vary with the time increment used to measure the changes.\n\nCritical moment exponent\n\nA parameter α that determines the highest moment of a distribution that is finite.",

    "text": "Learning to negate:\nI suppose there are many ways to learn to negate. Let’s consider two\n\nin English. We use the word ‘Not’.\nin logic we use the symbol \\neg.\nin python we use the keyword ‘not’\nin hungarian we use the word ‘nem’\n\nNot in all three cases a unitary operator that takes a single argument and returns the opposite of that argument.\nWe can use it to map the next signal to some other unique signal. This is how a unitary prefix operator works. For us though not means something more than some other signal it means all the other options. Not red means all the other colors, not cat means all the other animals. So the semantics we would like to capture requires that there are categories of signals and that the negation operator maps to the rest of the category. This is a handful. Also note that the categories may be defined as partial pooling equilibria.\nlet’s imagine that a group of Marmoset monkeys need to signal predators. The state space describes the predators are based on a product of the following features:\ntemporal : imminent, near, medium, distant type: cat, snake, pirana, eagle direction_theta: 0 1 2 3 position_phi: 0 1 2 3 number: 1, 2, 3, more\nyes they use solid coordinates to describe to location of the predators.\nthis gives us 4^4 = 256 states.\nthat’s a lot of signals. but a complex signaling system could be able to communicate about all of them.\nIf the monkeys use a template with 4 parts to communicate about the predators then they can use just four signals.\nalso the 4 signals share common semantics of increasing values. for the animals the threat level might be used to name them …\n\nstates St_0:St_{2M}\nlew_primitives = Sig_0:Sig_{2N} indicating 0…n and nor 0 … not n.\nneg_primitives = NOT, sig_0:sig_{N}\nprefix coding negation = &lt;NOT, neg_primitives&gt; = Sig_{n+N}\nsuffix coding negation = &lt;neg_primitives, NOT&gt;\nprefix protocol\nIn this case we don’t have a clear benefit of suffix and prefix. but later we will see how prefix coding is a fit for the desiderata of complex signaling systems.\nlet’s consider a 2 state with negation.\nin the lewis game we have 2 signals 0 and 1.\nin the negation_system,\nThe semantics of negation (its meaning) can be defined as we are use to i.e. no 1 mean 0 and no 0 means 1. But in this case we don’t get any benefit from the negation, we just get a system with longer signals. we can interpret it as a trick we learn to double the number of symbols we can use.\n\nnow consider a 4 symbol system with negation.\n\nA conjunctive signaling system\nA disjunctive signaling system\nA signaling system with conjunctions and disjunctions\nSignaling with Run-length encoding\nSignaling with Prefix-codes",

    "text": "[] TODO: fix mesa related errors\nIn (Skyrms 2010) philosopher and mathematician Brian Skyrms discusses how one can extend the concept of a signaling games into a full fledged signaling systems and to some extent a rudimentary language.\nI like many other found Signals to be a fascinating little book worth reading at least a couple of times. While Skyrms starts with a basic exposition motivated by Greek philosophers he eventually makes a deep dive into areas like reinforcement learning, replicator dynamics, mean field games and some other deep mathematical fields without much of introduction. In places the monographs seems incomplete and may require hunting the papers in the bibliography and possibly more recent work by the same authors.\nI slowly noticed it being cited in more and more papers which I read. This sort of indicated that intellectually more people we on the same path of thinking how to equip their problem solving with a signaling system or better yet to evolve a more sophisticated language.\nI went back several times to review the chapter on Complex signals, which I feel is the most interesting for real-world application. I began to think that the Lewis games are too rudimentary since signaling systems that evolve/learned from them are basically n-k maps of signals to meaning.\nWhat I wanted was a recipe for quickly agent that need to evolve and teach/learn a language for efficient communication.\nI wanted to go the relevant papers he covers on this area and then to see of there were newer results he did not cover. This turned out to be a bit of a challenge. In the mean time I also learned some courses on RL and even tried a couple of ideas from this book at work. I think I should summarize at least some of the more interesting results from the book.\nBesides a summary I also want to try to implement some of the keystone models in the book to see if I can derive the reductionist simple language learning game.",

    "text": "Sender-Receiver\n\nThere are two players, the sender and the receiver.\nNature chooses a state at random and the sender observes the state chosen.\nThe sender then sends a signal to the receiver, who cannot observe the state directly but does observe the signal.\nThe receiver then chooses an act, the outcome of which affects them both, with the payoff depending on the state.\nBoth have pure common interest—they get the same payoff—and there is exactly one “correct” act for each state.\nIn the correct act-state combination they both get positive payoff; otherwise payoff is zero.\nThe simplest case is one where there are the same number of states, acts, and signals.\n\nA separating equilibrium is called a signaling system\n\nIf we start with a pair of sender and receiver strategies, and switch the messages around the same way in both, we get the same payoffs. In particular, permutation of messages takes one signaling-system equilibrium into another.\n\nWe can understand a signaling system as a encoding look-up table by the sender and a decoding lookup table for the reciever which is the inverse of the first. The product of two permutations is the identity matrix. Each permutation of the identity matrix gives a valid signaling system\nQ3. Is there a most salient signaling system?\nSalience is a concept from Schelling’s Game theory that suggest that one solution to a coordination problem might be naturally better then others. (e.g. meeting a relative at the airport). This can be due to an externality to the pure coordination problem. Salience can also arise from non uniformity of the state distribution - by providing less frequent messages longer messages based on binary coding. The salience hierarchy might be grounded in risk - more urgent messages might be shorter and learned before the longer ones.\nmy thoughts on Salience:\n\nSalience would arise in nature through the non-uniform distribution of states which is ignored in most papers leading to equally salient signaling system. When the states are not uniformly distributed then the signals will not be uniformly distributed. The more common states should have more common signals. e.g. if snakes are more common than eagles then the signal for snake should be shorter/simpler/learned first than the signal for eagle. In another location the distributions could be reversed leading to a different salience hierarchy.\nAnother way (of seeing this is that) salience would arise in nature to minimize risks for the sender, who could become a target for a predator by sending a signal.\nTwo other source of salience are the risk of making mistakes and the cost of sending a signal.\nFinally there is nothing stopping the salience from being a function of all these factors through a product of their probabilities. Though this is more easily expressed in the language of fitness. Salience will select the language whose speakers gain the highest expected progeny (fitness) by avoiding risks, conserving energy and avoiding miscommunication for their habitat.\nIf the speakers migrate they might benefit from a language that is salient in multiple habitats. This is a form of generalization.\nIf there are different cost for encoding and decoding then the salience will be a function of the product of the encoding and decoding costs. This is a form of cost minimization. In this scenario there may be a competition between the sender and the receiver to minimize their costs. But the sender has the upper hand since the sender chooses the signal. The sender is the causal agent in the signaling system.\n\nQ4. How can two agents with different signaling find a SS that is midway between them (including systems with both shared and unique states)?\n\nIts fairly clear that under the rules of the Lewis game all valid signaling systems are isomorphic and none are more salient.\nIn nature salience might arise and a systems leading to greatest fitness in its users would be the most salient.\nTo find a signaling system that is midway between two signaling systems we could use the Cayley distance between the two permutations. This is the minimum number of transpositions required to transform one permutation into another. The median permutation would be the one that has half the Cayley distance to each signaling systems.\nIf the systems have salience we may want to also keep the most salient signals intact and now we have a more complex optimization problem. We could use the KL divergence between the two signaling systems to estimate the distance of the signaling distribution from a separating distribution.\n\nthe Cayley distance between two permutations is the minimum number of transpositions required to transform one permutation into another. it is a metric on the symmetric group.\nInformation in signals\nQ5. How can we minimally extend this framework to handle Errors and Deception\n\nSignals carry information. The natural way to measure the information in a signal is to measure the extent that the use of that particular signal changes probabilities. Accordingly, there are two kinds of information in the signals in Lewis sender-receiver games: information about what state the sender has observed and information about what act the receiver will take. The ﬁrst kind of infor- mation measures effectiveness of the sender’s use of signals to discriminate states; the second kind measures the effectiveness of the signal in changing the receiver’s probabilities of action.\n\n\nTODO: estimate information content of each signal for sender and receiver for separating and partial pooling cases\nTODO: use entropy for message level estimates of sender and receiver under separating signal, a synonym, a homonym.\nTODO: use entropy KL divergence to estimate a the distance of the signaling distribution from a separating distribution.\n\nActually there are a number of extensions one would like to consider for the Lewis framework:\n\nbottlenecks\n\nmore state than signals - this is the interesting case and where complex signaling systems should arise\nmore signals than states - this is the case where synonyms can arise\n\nbasic logical reasoning, conjunctions, disjunctions, negations\nmultiple senders and or receivers\n\nrewarding coordination (each state requires different actions from the agents - they are learning different receiver maps )\nrewarding correlated equilibrium (sender lets the receivers pick from correlated states at random allowing the receivers avoid penalty of mis-coordination.)\nnetworks of agents per the Goyal model in ch 11 and 13\n\n\ncomplex signals\n\nconjunction of signals,\nordered signals,\nrecursive signals, group\n\n\nEvolution\nWe first see two competing Signaling systems being tested in a population\n(Hofbauer and Sigmund 1998) Population dynamics - can be used to identify which dynamic equilibria are stable or unstable given an initial population of strategies\n\nHofbauer, J., and K. Sigmund. 1998. Evolutionary Games and Population Dynamics. Cambridge University Press. https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Xu-H0ClCHN8C.\nThere is a figure showing the field dynamics with basins of attractions arising from the population dynamics equations\nWe also see symmetry breaking selecting a signaling system to a system\n\n\\frac{dp(A)}{dt}=p(A)[U(A)-U]\n\nwhere\n\nU(A) is the average payoff to strategy A and\nU is the average payoff in the population.\n\n\nfrom pylab import *\n\nalpha, beta = 1, 1\nxvalues, yvalues = meshgrid(arange(0, 2.1, 0.1), arange(0, 2.1, 0.1))\nxdot = xvalues * alpha - beta\nydot = yvalues * alpha - beta\nstreamplot(xvalues, yvalues, xdot, ydot)\nshow()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe have a discussion of how signals might arise.",

    "text": "Lewis Signaling Game Model\nThe Lewis signaling game is a model of communication between two agents, a sender and a receiver. Nature picks a state, the sender observes the state, chooses a signal, and sends the signal to the receiver who then takes an action based on the signal. If the action of the receiver is a match with the state obseved by the sender, agents get a reward of 1, otherwise, they get a reward of 0. state, the sender and receiver get a reward of 1, otherwise, they get a reward of 0. is a match with the state, the sender and receiver get a reward of 1, otherwise, they get a reward of 0.\n\nclass HerrnsteinRL():\n    '''\n                                    The Urn model\n     nature            sender                 reciever     reward\n                       \n    | (0) | --{0}--&gt;  | (0_a)  | --{a}--&gt; | (a_0) | --{0}--&gt;   1   \n    |     |           | (0_b)  | --{b}    | (a_1) | --{1}--&gt;   0\n    |     |           +--------+    | +--&gt;+-------+\n    |     |                         +-|-+  \n    | (1) | --{1}--&gt;  | (1_a)  | --{a}+ +&gt;| (b_0) | --{1}--&gt;   1\n    |     |           | (1_b)  | --{b}---&gt;| (b_1) | --{0}--&gt;   0\n    +-----+           +--------+          +-------+\n    \n    \n    Herrnstein Urn algorithm\n    ------------------------\n    \n    1. nature picks a state \n    2. sender gets the state, chooses a signal by picking a ball in choose_option() from the stat'es urn\n    3. reciver gets the action, chooses an actuion by picking a ball in choose_option()\n    4. the balls in the urns are incremented if action == state\n    5. repeat\n    \n    '''\n    def __init__(self, options, learning_rate=1.0,verbose=False,name='Herrnstein matching law', balls=None):\n        \n        #

Homophones require the receiver to select an interpretation at random leading to lower payoffs since the receiver unable to recover the state cannot select the correct action. If the number of signal is the same as the number of actions, the pigeon hole principle guarantees that for every synonym there must be a homophone.\nIf we consider that for recoverability we need action and signals to be fully correlated it is easy to see that each failure to correlate\naction to signals results in a (partial) pooling solution. Thus there are far more partial pooling equilibria than separating equilibria. and it is thus no surprise that natural language is rife with homophones and synonyms.\nIn lieu of the fact that partial pooling equilibrium far out number the separating ones with and with out bottlenecks, setting up and later learning a separating signaling system with minimal homophones/synonyms is not trivial task. (If we also factor in cost/risk of miscommunication some homophones are clearly worse than others)\n\nEvolution for example may not be the best way for this.\nWhile researchers have very basic algorithms to do so, in terms of convergence rate and sample efficiency.\n\nAlthough not considered it is easy to see that there are far more partial pooling\nWe can conclude proceed to discuss the desiderata for learning algorithms.\nNote: Dropout Algorithm Introducing bottlenecks into neural networks tend to improve their ability to generalize by forcing them to avoid memorizing inputs and come up with more resiliant representations. This suggest that partial pooling equilibria may play a more significant role in structured/complex signaling systems.",

In this extended Lewis game where an agent is a receiver of two messages, each with a partial specification the first is {s1||s2} or {s3||s4} and the second {s1||s3} or {s2||s4}. The agent needs to process the two messages it to get the full state specification and take the appropriate action in response for getting a reward !\nThe added problem here is that the messages one of two flags, and one of two other flags do not have an established system for the message so learning the content of the signals needs to evolve together with the inference.\nThe sender can be two agents or one agent with a complex message.\nJeffrey Barrett in Barrett 2007a, 2007b. showed that this can be learned with Roth Erev RL\nthis is more interesting if there are errors:\n\nis a 10% chance of senders making mistakes with only 3% errors by the receiver?!

    "text": "Some thoughts\n\nlearning in the original Lewis language games is exponential in the size of the lexicon. It would seem that some complex signals systems should have orders of magnitude advantage in learning rates compared to the original variants. Lets consider a Lewis signaling system with 27 signals.\nThe learning is O(e^{27})\\propto5\\times10^{12}\nUnder a conjunctive structure with three messages a lexicon of 9 messages would be required.\nThe learning is O(e^{9})\\propto 8.1\\times10^{3}\nUnder Say we have a VSO complex signal with 3 signals per a positional POS category. This leads to 27 signal lexicon under the original lexicon. Using the complex system only 3 three signals need to be learned.\nSo that learning is O(e^{3}) \\propto 20\nIf we factor learning time as part of the costs of signaling we should expect complex signaling systems to emerge quickly. Also if we consider learning as part of In this case partial pooling states are acceptable and even desirable each signal now has three meaning depending on its position.\nIn NLP we never see such a perfect utilization of a SS where all synthetically messages are semantically meaningful. On the other hand NLP allow nesting so that sequence like V(VSO)(VSO) corresponding to 38 messages and adding a sub-category modifier prefix (MVMSMO) leads to (3^6) signals 729 signals without\nFor a simulation - some predators can be introduced into the environment nearby agents will signal it presence. Receivers who take that appropriate action will survive. Those that do not may die. Agent have longevity and must learn the language. When agents die they are replaced by infants without a uniform signaling weights.\nAnother point is that seems obvious is that if we learn/evolve the lexicon with just one one new word at a time the task becomes trivial. We just need to learn one new state to signal and one new signal to action mapping. But learning just one is a one to one matching. If we have some sense of the salience of the signals we can just order them in that order and we keep increasing fitness…. till we reach some marginal rate of fitness where new signals do almost nothing for our survival.\nIf we can evolve a complex signaling system we can move to next steps like optimizing our lexicon and grammar for:\n\nminimizing communications errors, (error detection and correction)\nmaximizing information transmission. (compression)\nminimizing cost of acquisition. (acquisition)\nthe trade off between grammatic generalization and easily learnability v.s. making the system harder to learn but more efficient for communication.\nhow do we handle inference (for logic)\nhow do we take advantage of predictability for partial messages\nwhat about a convention for grammar - useful for agents that need to exchange data in different formats efficently.\nCosts of morphotactics - can we do all this in practive with human sound systems. Can we figure our metrics for human languages.\nGiven a (human) language tree can we posit a most pasimonius path for its evolution.\n\n\nIn (Skyrms 2010) the author discusses how a Lewis signaling games can be viewed as a mechanism in which a rudimentary signaling system can give rise to a simple language.\n\nSkyrms, Brian. 2010. “14512 Complex Signals and Compositionality.” In Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580828.003.0013.\nThe languages arising from Lewis signaling games are limited.\n\ntldr:\nThe book is aptly nameed signals. It is primarily looking at signaling systems not at anything resembling a fully fledged languages.\n\nWhat is missing -\n\nreal distribution of states - very large set of messages\nreal distribution of messages - a subset of phonology\na communication protocol over a lossy amd risky channel which can lead to\n\nsender may err (most of the RL models in the book - unkike mine lead to making mistakes at a certain frequency)\n\nmistakes can happen at either end\nlewis games have shared reward but mistakes will impact agents assymetricaly\n\nrecivers taking the wrong action will face greater risks\nsenders making maistakes can\n\n\nsender\ntransmission errors\nrisk related to message length\nrisk associaded with mistakes in the protocol.\nposibility of partial messages and pressure on shorter messages\n\nconsideation of “learning by correcting mistakes”\n\n\na grammar\ngroup dynamics - there are many languages. Languages may have emereged over and over in different locations and grooups seems to have played a major role here. I beleive that a basic model of many agents should lead to rapid\nsome constraints\n\ndistibutional contraints already menthioned\nbasic languages learning must be rapid even if learnig the full system takes years.\n\nmorphology speed up learning of the lexicon\n\nlearning k lexemes + a morphology of m productions =&gt; k \\times m lexicon with a coordiantion cost of k+m\n\nsyntax allows makes more efficent use of the\n\n\n\n\nThe main formalism is the Lewis Signing game. It covers in essense nothing more than coordinating a shared lexcion of signals. There is a lot of effort made to consider the seperating equilibria. But there are many more seperating equilibria and some of these are not only better suited for communications but also emergence of categories a type of messages that can be sepcilized/disambiguated using another signal. However this requires setting up a communication protocol. Lewis signaling can help with the coordination task for that by picking a subset of protocol from many possible options. But there is a second, more salient part - what is the protocol?",

    "text": "Test algorithm with multiple hyperparameter settings\nThe performance of an algorithm varies based on its hyperparamters, which again are its configuration settings. Some algorithms may not vary much, and others might have far better or worse performance for certain settings. Often we focus our attention on 1 or 2 hyperparameters for a given algorithm because they are the most important ones.\nFor random forest there are two particularly important hyperparameters: mtry and maximum leaf nodes. Mtry is how many features are randomly chosen within each decision tree node - in other words, each time the tree considers making a split. Maximum leaf nodes controls how complex each tree can get.\nLet’s try 3 different mtry options.\n\n# sqrt(p) is the default value of mtry for classification.\nfloor(sqrt(ncol(x_train)))\n\n[1] 3\n\n## [1] 3\n# Let's try 3 multiplies of this default: 0.5, 1, and 2.\n(mtry_seq = floor(sqrt(ncol(x_train)) * c(0.5, 1, 2)))\n\n[1] 1 3 7\n\n## [1] 1 3 7\nlearners = create.Learner(\"SL.ranger\", tune = list(mtry = mtry_seq))\n\n# Review the resulting object\nlearners\n\n$grid\n  mtry\n1    1\n2    3\n3    7\n\n$names\n[1] \"SL.ranger_1\" \"SL.ranger_2\" \"SL.ranger_3\"\n\n$base_learner\n[1] \"SL.ranger\"\n\n$params\nlist()\n\nSL.ranger_1\n\nfunction (...) \nSL.ranger(..., mtry = 1)\n\nSL.ranger_2\n\nfunction (...) \nSL.ranger(..., mtry = 3)\n\nSL.ranger_3\n\nfunction (...) \nSL.ranger(..., mtry = 7)\n\nset.seed(1)\n\n# Fit the CV.SuperLearner.\n# We use V = 3 to save computation time; for a real analysis use V = 10 or 20.\ncv_sl = CV.SuperLearner(Y = y_train, X = x_train, \n                        family = binomial(), V = 3, \n                        SL.library = c(\"SL.mean\", \"SL.glmnet\", learners$names, \"SL.ranger\"))\n\nLoading required namespace: glmnet\n\n\nLoading required namespace: ranger\n\n# Review results.\nsummary(cv_sl)\n\n\nCall:  \nCV.SuperLearner(Y = y_train, X = x_train, V = 3, family = binomial(), SL.library = c(\"SL.mean\",  \n    \"SL.glmnet\", learners$names, \"SL.ranger\")) \n\nRisk is based on: Mean Squared Error\n\nAll risk estimates are based on V =  3 \n\n       Algorithm      Ave       se      Min      Max\n   Super Learner 0.067516 0.011105 0.056210 0.081632\n     Discrete SL 0.071761 0.011897 0.057843 0.092998\n     SL.mean_All 0.251267 0.010352 0.228500 0.289600\n   SL.glmnet_All 0.078227 0.015002 0.070147 0.087422\n SL.ranger_1_All 0.102194 0.011360 0.089415 0.111369\n SL.ranger_2_All 0.078006 0.011196 0.064298 0.093298\n SL.ranger_3_All 0.071761 0.011897 0.057843 0.092998\n   SL.ranger_All 0.078469 0.011270 0.065888 0.089501\n\n\nWe see here that mtry = 7 performed a little bit better than mtry = 1 or mtry = 3, although the difference is not significant. If we used more data and more cross-validation folds we might see more drastic differences. A higher mtry does better when a small percentage of variables are predictive of the outcome, because it gives each tree a better chance of finding a useful variable.\nNote that SL.ranger and SL.ranger_2 have the same settings, and their performance is very similar - statistically a tie. It’s not exactly equivalent due to random variation in the two forests.\nA key difference with SuperLearner over caret or other frameworks is that we are not trying to choose the single best hyperparameter or model. Instead, we usually want the best weighted average. So we are including all of the different settings in our SuperLearner, and we may choose a weighted average that includes the same model multiple times but with different settings. That can give us better performance than choosing only the single best settings for a given algorithm, which has some random noise in any case.\nMulticore parallelization SuperLearner makes it easy to use multiple CPU cores on your computer to speed up the calculations. We first need to setup R for multiple cores, then tell CV.SuperLearner to divide its computations across those cores.\nThere are two ways to use multiple cores in R: the “multicore” system and the “snow” system. Windows only supports the “snow” system, which is more difficult to use, whereas macOS and Linux can use either one.\nFirst we show the “multicore” system version:\n\n# Setup parallel computation - use all cores on our computer.\n(num_cores = RhpcBLASctl::get_num_cores())\n\n[1] 8\n\n# Use 2 of those cores for parallel SuperLearner.\n# Replace \"2\" with \"num_cores\" (without quotes) to use all cores.\noptions(mc.cores = 2)\n\n# Check how many parallel workers we are using (on macOS/Linux).\ngetOption(\"mc.cores\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n# We need to set a different type of seed that works across cores.\n# Otherwise the other cores will go rogue and we won't get repeatable results.\n# This version is for the \"multicore\" parallel system in R.\nset.seed(1, \"L'Ecuyer-CMRG\")\n\n# While this is running check CPU using in Activity Monitor / Task Manager.\nsystem.time({\n  cv_sl = CV.SuperLearner(Y = y_train, X = x_train, family = binomial(),\n                          #

This may be added to the SuperLearner package sometime in the future.\n\n# Review meta-weights (coefficients) from a CV.SuperLearner object\nreview_weights = function(cv_sl) {\n  meta_weights = coef(cv_sl)\n  means = colMeans(meta_weights)\n  sds = apply(meta_weights, MARGIN = 2,  FUN = sd)\n  mins = apply(meta_weights, MARGIN = 2, FUN = min)\n  maxs = apply(meta_weights, MARGIN = 2, FUN = max)\n  # Combine the stats into a single matrix.\n  sl_stats = cbind(\"mean(weight)\" = means, \"sd\" = sds, \"min\" = mins, \"max\" = maxs)\n  # Sort by decreasing mean weight.\n  sl_stats[order(sl_stats[, 1], decreasing = TRUE), ]\n}\n\nprint(review_weights(cv_sl), digits = 3)\n\n                mean(weight)     sd   min   max\nSL.ranger_3_All       0.6907 0.2955 0.411 1.000\nSL.glmnet_All         0.2588 0.2295 0.000 0.437\nSL.ranger_2_All       0.0504 0.0874 0.000 0.151\nSL.mean_All           0.0000 0.0000 0.000 0.000\nSL.ranger_1_All       0.0000 0.0000 0.000 0.000\nSL.ranger_All         0.0000 0.0000 0.000 0.000\n\n\nNotice that in this case the ensemble never uses the mean nor the randomForest with mtry = 1. Also the LASSO (glmnet) was only used on a subset of the folds. Adding multiple configurations of randomForest was helpful because mtry = 7 was used. However, based on the minimum column we can see that no algorithm was used every single time.\nWe recommend reviewing the weight distribution for any SuperLearner project to better understand which algorithms are chosen for the ensemble.",

    "text": "Introduction\nsupervised and unsupervised models are great for most NLP tasks, yet both approaches have their limitations. Supervised models require labeled data, which is usually in short supply, while unsupervised models often lack the precision needed for many applications.\n\nLarge language models like GPT-3 can provide us with a way to genereate text on demand. They are weak when generating from sparse data (Hellucination) and can be biased.\n\nPerhaps RL which is able to learn from mistakes, as well as use supervised as well as unsupervised learning as representations can perhaps bridge the gaps that LLM cannot adress so well.\nThe main challanges in RL however are difficulty in Trasfer learning, or generalizing between similar and or related tasks. I believe that within the NLP domain transfer learning seems to be a bit easier than in other domains, as the representations learned from one task can be used in another task.\n\nNLP is a domain in which skills learned in one task may be transferrable into other task.\nMultigoal learning can be used to solve this issue.\nMeta learning can be used to learn from multiple tasks and generalize to new tasks.\nCurriculum learning can be applied to:\n\nidentify weaknesses in the model\ncollect more samples to adress weakness\ncollect appropriate samples to correct for biases that emerge in the model.\n\nEvolving language from scratch using lewis siggins games and thier extentions can also be viewed as as from of Meta learning.\nCan we define a abstract hamiltonian that can be used for energy/entropy based generation of text using the hamiltonian of the promprts/context\n\nCan we define a minimalist grammar using this abstract formalism.\nCan we define a resonant solution multiple hamiltonians that interact on differernt levels.\nCan we make this something that is a good fit for multi-headed attention perhaps analagous to how the finit state machine morphology was simplified by understanding that the FSM can be represented as a regular expression and that the generations we bounded by the lexicon. In other words can we create a hamiltonian that introduced contraints on the generation of text using different heads of the transformer model and thereby places bounds on the computational complexity of the model?\n\n\nRewards for different task can be defined in different ways, and the reward function can be used to guide the model to learn the task. At the start the reward function seems to be the greatest unknown. I believe that this will be the most interesting part of the project and perhaps a driver for innovation.\n\nTasks and components\n\n\nCreating a minimalist language model that allows for pretraining and fine tuning with small payloads of data generated by the RL agents.\nAugmenting the LLM with sophisticated embeddings that are most amenable for transfer learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochman2024,\n  author = {Bochman, Oren},\n  title = {NLP with {RL}},\n  date = {2024-09-27},\n  url = {https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2024/2024-09-27-NLP-RL/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochman, Oren. 2024. “NLP with RL.” September 27, 2024. https://orenbochman.github.io/posts/2024/2024-09-27-NLP-RL/.",

    "text": "Seperating the environment from the agents\nMesa is a great tool for ABM but it has some limitations. One of these is that the reporting mechanism tries to get the same data from all agents. The way Sugarscape is implemented is that there are agents for sugar, spice and pollution as well as different actors. This makes it impractical to get a single data frame for all agents. This assumption is also carried over to the visualization code so that it is not a simple fix. Another problem with this approach it increases the number of agents in proportion to the size of the simulation.\nFor example for a 50x50 grid we have 2500 agents. If we have 2 resources and pollution which also requires tracking pollution flux and two iterations to perform the diffusion. Python isn’t particularly fast since it is interpreted and adding all this overhead makes the simulation slow. Also I wanted to also test some ideas with more resources which would require a larger grid.\nOne way to reduce the number of agents is to have a single patch agent type that can handle resources and pollution - which had been implemented in the Sugarscape with traders sample. This still means most agent are patches and makes agent’s code more complex. Data processing becomes flaky and there are not samples or documentation to help out.\nWhat this led me to do is to make a clearer separation between the environment and the agents. I migrated the resource code into the grid which had the added bonus of making agents simpler.",

This got me thinking about using a strategy pattern and then the agent delegating the rule’s behavior to the rule. THis is perhaps not the most elegant solution - but it does have a number of advantages.\n\nit allows one to define an api for the model and agent step.\nit allows one to easily swap out rules and test different variants.\nit allows one to easily extend the rules by inheriting from the base rule class.\nit allows one to store data collection and visualization code in the rule along size the code that generates the data. This is made simpler by also using the builder pattern to construct the data collector.\nit also easy to add two functions to support rules’ initialization, at the model and agent levels\nthese can be expanded with a update model and agent state operation that facilitates controlling the simulation from a ui at run time - another big advantage of the strategy pattern.",

    "section": "Makeing sugrscape more dynamic",
    "text": "Makeing sugrscape more dynamic\nThere are a number of ways to make Sugerscape more dynamic.\n\nDynamic rules - swapping rules during the simulation\nOne way is to swap rules in the middle of the simulation as the book frequently does. The simple way to do this is use an array of rules which specific the rules in use. This is frequently used in the book which generally used three or four rules in most cases.\n\n\nEvolution based on fitness and reproduction\nThis concept is not fully implemented in the book but at least two aspects are inherent in the simulation\n\nselection weeds out less fit agents\nsexual reproduction allows for the creation of new agents with a mix of the parents’ traits.\n\nwhat the authors did not include are\n\nmutation\ndifferential reproduction based on fitness\na fitness function - based on the expected progeny of an agent.\nThis can be based recusively by a linear model of intrinsics like high vision and low metabolism a smaller initial endowment the total amount of resources an agent has collected thier age the number of progeny they have - and the thier fitness.\n\nthe amount of resources an agent has.\n\n\nPrivate information and coalitions\nAgents do not have private information.\nThe agents form coalitions through culture but these are not used in any social sense nor for optimizing behaviour.\nAdding private information can make trade more realistic. Adding private opens the door to construction of bayesian agents that can estimate the private information of other agents based on watching thier actions.\nEstablishing coalitions can be used to coordinate activities in ways that are optimal for the group and possibly over come the social dilemmas that arise in the simulation like the problems posed by pollution.\nPrivate information and coalitions can be used to implement more realistic trade rules. These could be rudimentary versions of cooperative and companies but could also lead to a form of goverment.\n\n\nLearning and reinforcement learning\nLearning and reinforcement learning\nThis idea is already inhernet in of the sugarscape pardigm. IT basicaly involves adding a fitness function to the agents and then selecting the best agents to reproduce. The book uses a simple fitness function based on the amount of resources an agent has. This can be extended to include other factors such as pollution, trade, combat, and culture.\n\nMore challenging and beyond the scope of what is discussed in the book are scenarios where we test different rule variants during a single run. For example we can use a variant of culture that turns combat/trade rule on or off for agents with culture rule c_1 but other agents can have trade and combat on or of controlled by sex - i.e. at birth. This can let us study highly dynamic version of hawk dove game from game theory in simulations before we analyze it mathematically.\nAgent having private information, and forming coalitions. Both concepts are discussed in to text but not implemented. The first in the context of more realistic trade rules. The latter in the context of paying agents to reduce harvesting to avoid pollution.\nEven more dynamic is granting agents the ability to learn optimal behavior and take charge of their actions which also involves adding reinforcement learning to the model. This is already extant in Sugarscape through selection and reproduction but adding RL add a much greater level of dynamism to the model. Note also that this is a different behavioural paradigm from the one used in the book and requires some deeper thinking on hot to implement it. (What are the limits on experience for agent learning - do they only have thier last state, thier full sim’s history, all thier past lives, every past life. What about being taught by their parents at some cost or rate of transmision. Basicaly what is the minimal experience to get to pareto optimality on a set of rules.)\n\nThe problem of using an array is that some of the logic for action in the book have constraints on order. e.g. agents move, harvest, pollute, eat pollute again, perhaps die die if they are out of resources trade reproduce etc and then die of old age and pass of thier inheritance. This is a lot of steps for only some of the rules and and the order is important in some cases.\nMore challanging and beyond the scope of what is discussed in the book are scenarios where we test different rule variants during a single run. For example we can use a variant of culture that turns combant rule on or off for agents Alson side agent that have combat on or off permamently.\nEven more intersting is granting agents the ability to learn optimal behavior and take charge of thier actions which also involves adding reinforcement learning to the model.\nA third\nThis becomes a problem when we want to test different variants of the rules or change rules during the simulation. My approach to this is to to encapsulate each rule in a class this also makes it much simpler to extend simple rules using inheriatance.\nThe next idea was to make each rule also take charge of it’s own data collection and visualization. Again this makes it easier to extend the rules and to keep track of the data.\n\n\nSecond order effects - linking rules\nFollowing Schelling segregation model, Sugarscape is a model of social activity that emerges from simple rules. One of the key ideas in the development of the sugarscape model is the reductionsit study of how a social activity like segregation can emerge from a simple rule. Many aspects of a society are considered in the book yet many others are not.\nHowever it would seem that the next step in a reductionist study of society would be to consider how different rules interact with each other. The book does consider many such cases - most simulations cobine just a few rules. This is not done in the book.\nfrom hetrogineity interacting with simple rules. THe One of the things that is not done in the book is to link the rules. For example\nThe next Idea I had to handle this is to move the environment to the grid. This has a few implications\n\nwe need to override the grid.\nagents need to access the grid during the simulation.\nthe environment will need to activate the resource growth and pollution diffusion.\n\nHowever, this seems to be a good way to separate the environment from the agents and indeed the agent code get a little bit simpler in when it comes to harvesting.\nWe also have a sigle type of agent allowing the data collection to proceed in the way mesa is designed.\nIt is now possible to replace Multigrid with SingleGrid. - This quickly uncovered a bug in the agent creation code. It does not check if a new agent’s position is already occupied. - The following fixes this issue.\npos = self.random.choice(self.grid.select_cells(only_empty=True))\nI want some help in coding Sugarscape pollution diffusion rule using mesa’s new add_property_layer\nI have written the following code:\nclass ResourceGrid(SingleGrid):\n\n    def __init__(self, width, height, torus):\n        super().__init__(width, height, torus)\n        # Initialize each cell with resource attributes\n\n        sugar_distribution = np.genfromtxt(Path(__file__).parent / \"sugar-map.txt\")\n        spice_distribution = np.flip(sugar_distribution, 1)\n\n        #elevation = PropertyLayer(\"elevation\", width, height, default_value=0)\n        max_sugar = PropertyLayer('max_sugar',width,height,sugar_distribution)\n        sugar = PropertyLayer('sugar',width,height,sugar_distribution)\n        max_spice = PropertyLayer('max_spice',width,height,spice_distribution)        \n        spice = PropertyLayer('spice',width,height,spice_distribution)\n        pollution_flux = PropertyLayer('pollution_flux',width,height,default_value=0.0)\n        pollution = PropertyLayer('pollution',width,height,default_value=0.0)\n\n        #self.add_property_layer(elevation )\n        self.add_property_layer(max_sugar)\n        self.add_property_layer(max_spice)\n        self.add_property_layer(sugar)\n        self.add_property_layer(spice)\n        self.add_property_layer(pollution_flux)\n        self.add_property_layer(pollution)\n\n    def get_resource(self, x,y, key='sugar'):        \n        return self.properties[key].data[x,y]\n\n\n    def set_resource(self, x,y, amount,key='sugar'):        \n        return self.properties[key].set_cell((x,y),amount)\n\n    def get_resources(self, pos, key='sugar'):        \n        return self.properties[key].data[pos[0],pos[1]]\n\n\n    def step(self, sugar_growth_rate=1, spice_growth_rate=1, pollution_decay_rate=1.0):   \n        # growback can be done without a loop using a lambda.\n\n        self.properties['sugar'].modify_cells(np.add,sugar_growth_rate)\n        self.properties['sugar'].modify_cells(np.fmin,self.properties['max_sugar'].data)\n\n        self.properties['spice'].modify_cells(np.add,spice_growth_rate)\n        self.properties['spice'].modify_cells(np.fmin,self.properties['max_spice'].data)\n\n           def step(self, sugar_growth_rate=1, spice_growth_rate=1, pollution_decay_rate=1.0):   \n        # growback can be done without a loop using a lambda.\n\n        self.properties['sugar'].modify_cells(np.add,sugar_growth_rate)\n        self.properties['sugar'].modify_cells(np.fmin,self.properties['max_sugar'].data)\n\n        self.properties['spice'].modify_cells(np.add,spice_growth_rate)\n        self.properties['spice'].modify_cells(np.fmin,self.properties['max_spice'].data)\n\n        self.properties['pollution_flux'].modify_cells(np.multiply,pollution_decay_rate)\n        self.properties['pollution'].data= self.properties['pollution_flux'].data\nNote: the diffusion rule should: 1. update the pollution_flux using the mean pollution from the adjacent cells 2. apply the pollution_decay_rate to the flux 3. update the pollution from the flux\nSome more ideas.\nAs I went on improving the design of my sugarscape simulaition I came across.\nThere are many variants on even the most basic rule.\nThe motion rule:\n\nthe ability to go to any of the maximal sugar points in the field of view creates a nomadic type of individual.\nthere was a bug in mesa’s randomization which led to near cyclic motion for agents at the edge of the sugar contours. Periodic motion is a form of teratorilaism which could be good for avoiding desiases and may make it easier to mate with other nearby teritorial agents. The idea here is to implement an exploter agent that prefers to go and exploit places it visted before if they are maximal. This can lead to near periodic motion. Is this a form of chaos. Also we may give it a epsilon chance to explore which may let it discover nearby maxima.\nA friend suggested letting agents leave phenome tracks. These can form the basis of a signaling system.\n\nThe first signal is a phenome trail from distant maximum sugar/spice zones.\nThe second might indicate where a viable mates might be found. Since i’m interested in adding basic and complex singaling sytems to ABM these can be intersting to implemnt using new resource layers.\n\nBoids/Flocking motion.\nFire fighthing - go the the hottest safe spot and put out the fire.\nPollution cleaners - go to highest safe pollution and clean up.\nA missonary might go to pockets of counter culture to switch them over. This might work better if the culture had memory based on age. I.e. a binomial with a,b where a is the time steps it was 0 and b the time steps it was one. making it harder to convert you and increasing the chance you flip back. More generaly an urn model is even more genral.\nThese can be used to comunicate",

    "text": "The SugarScape Trade rule issues\n\nthe rule is unfair.\n\n\nWhile the Edgeworth box has pareto-efficent solutions where indifference curves are at a tangent and therefore the MRS which corresponding to prices for trade are in agreement. Also there is only one such point for each pair of curves if they have a common point. Also there is one point where both utilities are highest. This seems to be the best trade to consider.\nThe trade algorithms uses points where the two curves intersect not tangents. However each indiffence curve probably intersect with all the other traders curves. Some may have more curves in the box (their utility levels are packed closer) Others less. Without some mechanism to sort these out we cant be certain that bragaining steps are sensible. The problem is that agents are not realy indiffernt to all the combinatino of sugar and spice - at least in the sense that under a certain amount of sugar or spice they will be wealthy on paper but likely starve in the next time step. The algorithm leads to more on diagonal solutions but what if I am very sugar rich. I may trade 1/N of my excess sufar with each nighbour for one unit of spice. But one unit of spice from each may mean they have less then thier metabolism and they will starve before they can makr a trade or harvest ay spice.\nOne agent may have more viable cuves than the other. idealy we should be picking two curves with similar utiltiy levels…. The intersection points can represent radicaly different pricing levels, particularly for an agent with a highly imballnced endowment. The pareto point leads to a point where both MRS are equal and the resulting endowments are better.\nBut we don’t really consider which points on the current curve to use. Each intersection corresponds to different utility level for our trading partner. It seem the intersection closest to the diagonal is best for our partner but we seem to be picking the one which is furthest - most likely to be the worst for them - possibly starving them.\nSo on this issue we should pick a point on the indiffeerence curve that at a utility level that at least won’t starve out trade partner or ourseves.\nThis mean clipping the indiffernce curves at the metabolic minimum.\nthere is no mony and trades are in integral units and detrmine the trade amount\nthe trade amount are unfair because the prices are unfair and because one side is pegged to 1.\nAll this is moot if the alg can reach the same pareto optimal solution by small steps. But I think that its unlikely. In the trade because the steps are integral and one side is pegged to one there are roundoff errors. With every trade some value is lost (on one or both sides).\n\nafter each both sides are reevaluated reducing the price as well and the price drops so that the more needy agent will less willing or able to make all the trades it needs to make to get the the pareto point. And they may now be approximating different pareto point.\n\nBoth agents agent who participite in trade could be better off if allowed to pick\ntheir preffered trade partner.\nperhaps in view of this agents should be allowed to refuse unless they get a better deal. This suggest looking at stable marriage alg. where prior to trade the are serveral rounds in each neighbourhood for matching traders.\n\n\ntrade is inefficent.\n\n\ntrade always use 1 unit for one of the agents.\nto trade 3 for 3 3 trades are needed.\n\n\ntrade increases utulity but can make an agent worse off.\n\n\nafter a trade a fertile agent can become wealthier but infertile if they are reduced below a multiple of thier endowment.\nafter a trade an agent can be wealthier in utility but not in survivability so they may have an extra unit of sugar they don’t need but not enogh spice so they might starve.\n\n\nagents that have participate in tradetraded will generaly\na smarter agent who can pick his trade partners and thier order can do them some damage",

    "text": "Abstract\n\nNatural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality. In this paper, we study whether the language emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in representation learning, we establish three main results.\nFirst, given sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop the ability to refer to novel composite concepts.\nSecond, there is no correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and its ability to generalize.\nThird, while compositionality is not necessary for generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents. We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more likely to survive and thrive\n— (Chaabouni et al. 2020)",

Intuitively, if similar objects share much of the message structure (e.g., common prefixes or suffixes), and dissimilar objects have little common structure in their respective messages, then the topographic similarity should be high, the highest possible value being 1 – (Lazaridou et al. 2018)\n\n\n\\mathit{topsim}=\\rho\\left(\\left\\{d\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(j)}\\right), d\\left(\\mathbf{m}^{(i)}, \\mathbf{m}^{(j)}\\right)\\right\\}_{i, j=1}^{n}\\right)\n\n\n\n\nLazaridou, Angeliki, Karl Moritz Hermann, Karl Tuyls, and Stephen Clark. 2018. “Emergence of Linguistic Communication from Referential Games with Symbolic and Pixel Input.” https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03984.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositional Disentanglement\n\n\n\n\npositional disentanglement (posdis) metric measures whether symbols in specific positions tend to univocally refer to the values of a specific attribute.

However, we can easily imagine a language where symbols univocally refer to distinct input elements independently of where they occur, making order irrelevant.3 Hence, we also introduce bag-of-symbols disentanglement (bosdis). The latter maintains the requirement for symbols to univocally refer to distinct meanings, but captures the intuition of a permutation-invariant language, where only symbol counts are informative – (Chaabouni et al. 2020)\n\n\n\\mathit{bodis}=\\frac{1}{c_{voc}} \\sum_{j=1}^{c_{voc}} \\frac{\\mathcal{I}(n_j,a^j_1)-\\mathcal{I}(n_j,a^j_2)}{\\mathcal{H}(n_j)}\n\n\nn_j a counter of the j-th symbol in a message\n\n\n\n\nChaabouni, Rahma, Eugene Kharitonov, Diane Bouchacourt, Emmanuel Dupoux, and Marco Baroni. 2020. “Compositionality and Generalization in Emergent Languages.” In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, edited by Dan Jurafsky, Joyce Chai, Natalie Schluter, and Joel Tetreault, 4427–42.

    "text": "My Thoughts\nWe have three main results:\n\nGeneralization Emerges “Naturally” if the Input Space is Large\nNo Correlation Between Compositionality and Generalization\nCompositionality increases Ease of Transmission\n\nFrom a simple analysis of the lewis signaling game. The cost of coordination for an non compositional language is exponential in the number of states. For a compositional language the cost can reduced an exponential of the size of the lexicon (number of atomic signals) plus some constant factor for learning the grammar if it is some small set of aggregation rules. (Usually one rule is sufficient to support compositionality).\nThe lewis signaling game is more or less guaranteed to converge to some a signaling system1 with the suitable algorithm. Without a good algorithm the game is more likely to converge to a partial pooling equilibrium where payoffs are less than 1 due to one side or both being unable to conflate different states.\n1 one that has an expected payoff of 1What this means is that all things being equal the compositional language will emerge much sooner the the non compositional language given the opportunity to do so. So why don’t we see this.\n\nWhen the number of states isn’t larger than the number of basic signals it is easier to learn a non compositional language. So we should put a cap on the number of basic signals.\nThe multiplier for learning grammar may be big especially if we use a neural network, more so if the grammar is complicates. So if we don’t see compositionality perhaps we need to make the grammar simpler or the state space bigger.\nThis is theoretical - perhaps since we use a neural network rather then a tabular RL solution we need lots of data to learn anything. As we go though the epoch there may be enough rounds in the lewis game for use to establish a convention without the need for compositionality.\nOk Let’s say we have a fast learning algorithm and a big but manageable input space. Do we get compositionality. The answer is not necessarily.\n\nLet dive deeper into this last point:\nDespite what Chat GPT will tell you if you ask the lewis signaling game only outputs simple languages. No complex signals, no grammar, no recursion and no compositionality. It has many possible equilibria and none correspond to a language complex signals or grammar.\nFor grammar and complex signals to emerge you need to tweak the lewis signaling game. (Skyrms 2010) reports on a couple of papers which produce complex signals. Most of the interesting work came out after the book. Regardless in the papers the agents were given a simple aggregation rule to follow. The conjunction leads to a bag of words. The concatenation leads to sequences. But what they don’t seem to stress is that for a complex signals we want a state that decomposes into a way we can match in our aggregation rule. Think group homomorphism. And there may be multiple decompositions so think normal subgroups.\n\nSkyrms, Brian. 2010. “14512 Complex Signals and Compositionality.” In Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580828.003.0013.\nThere isn’t a how to guide to get the agents to use some arbitrary grammar. (Not AFAIK). There are a bunch of books and many papers but they don’t seem to have a the kind of recipes that are needed here. In my view most of these books look for the answers based on what they know rather what they need to know. They may have fascinating points but lead to greater confusion rather then more clarity.\nOne abstraction I came across is that the notion of a grammar is essentially a decision tree mapping the signals back into the state. Decision trees sounds simple enough but this tree is not given but needs to be learned by trial and error. Signals due to successes are sparse. There might be a setting in which a sender can construct the tree and then the receiver just needs to learn it. But it requires the sender to have access to the distribution of states and sub states. This distribution can be used to come up with a tree that is optimal for a given set of signals. If the sender and receiver don’t have access to this distribution the can learn it. But my work indicates that to learn the distribution to a high degree of accuracy requires more turns then my lewis signaling algorithm does. At least for simple signaling systems.\nFor a simple signaling system I developed two algorithms. THe first learned a signaling system. The second first enumerated all signaling systems of a certain size and then selected one from those it believed were optimal. Each new state would reduce the belief until the sender and receiver had a common belief. This may not scale but can adapt to new distributions seamlessly. I thought about a similar approach for working with complex grammars. But In this case I did not have an efficient way to enumerate all possible grammars. However there seems to be a way to do this. Instead of considering all decision trees, we can instead consider just huffman trees. These means that the sender and receiver use the lewis signaling game to learn a shared huffman tree. The outcome is that the tree should compress the state space. The only problem is that such a grammar is not likely to be compositional and would be very difficult to learn for humans.\nSo what we need is for the agents to learn the tree interactively. Two approaches come to mind and these are 1. huffman coding - which builds the tree but doesn’t update it to account for distributional shits. 2. Vitter algorithm for adaptive huffman coding - which updates the tree as new states are seen. THis is 3. adaptive arithmetic coding - which is a generalization of adaptive huffman coding.\nOne point to consider is that such a grammar is likely to provide a good compression of the state space. This is due to the these algorithms also being compression algorithms.\nI would imagine that the output of such a grammar to be a binary sequence. This suggest that this would lead to a entangled representation with no discernable compositional structure.\nNow there are reputedly many languages with very simple grammars. But the ones we are familiar with are not simple. They also have large lexicons. We need to put that aside and look for ways to work with simple grammars. It is quite possible to come up with two or three rules that can generate both morphology and a recursive syntax. It might be possible with one rule.\nOk lets briefly consider the other two points.",

    "text": "TL-DR rethinking 💭 topological alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergent Languages In a Nutshell\n\n\nRecently, I’ve been revisiting an old idea about creating a topological model of alignment. The machine translation task has been solved largely by using deep learning models. My idea was to leverage the unique structure of Wikipedia to learn to translate using non-parallel texts. The links in many case provide hints that could be used to tease out more and more word pairs and phrases that are translations.\nToday I want to revisit this idea. I’m sure that even if it is only an idea, now I know more, like how to create embeddings for each language. How to make word sense embeddings, and how to create cross-language embeddings. This approach may be more feasible. I also learned how to represent a word as a word context pair. This is an idea that might have been useful in the original version. We also have wiki data with even more cross-language information unavailable.\nWhile the in Wikipedia are what makes it a wiki they are just a step in the right direction. One can easily envision using linked data to highlight parallel-structure across a corpus. For news articles appearing in temporal-proximity this might be easier. But it should be possible to do so for any corpus of similar texts. With enough such links one can uncover a vast hierarchy of related words, terms, phrases, idioms, relations and events. And once a high percentage of these have been learned the rest of the text may be translated using this translation model. If we want to do even better we could list the most likely translations for the remaining words and phrases and subject them to further analysis. A RL agent might be trained to look for new items to add to the corpus and keep improving the translation model as a curriculum learning task.\nThis was based on work on Wikipedia, where hints like cross-language links, Wikidata, and templates provide valuable resources for learning translations, even when text varies or translations are incomplete. Over time, I became aware of more resources that could be used, such as movie subtitles, book translations, and parallel corpora. However, news articles and blogs are often not parallel; they can contain similar information.\nI thought about this when I first took a class in topology in my second year at university. What we learned was that topologies have an interesting property. The product of a topology is also a topology, and also that topological properties are preserved by a homeomorphism.\nI did not possess the modern view that the translation problem is one of alignment and segmentation. I was considering translation from the point of view of decryption, where one considers the incidence of coincidence that two tokens co-occur together and so on. I thought that what might scale better1 for translation is to find semantic compatible neighborhoods around semantic equivalent landmarks in texts that cover the same material2 and then use these as candidates for learning to translate. The text might be divergent, but if they covered the same content, many local neighborhoods must be very similar. If we see them several times. The landmarks might be to see how well words at different distances in that neighborhood to equivalent landmarks; these might allow us to learn to translate into parts that are small enough around proper nouns we should have many equivalent segments. And many more that are not. But we might be able to see if we can swap out various inverse images of the same segment. (Or perhaps check them for similarity) The inverse images are in the same language, so we only need to test for similarity in the same language, which is apparently an easier task.\nSo, the crux is rather than looking at two parallel texts and trying to segment them into aligned units. I wanted to find local neighborhoods in the text that might be aligned and test the hypothesis that they are translations of each other. For example, in Wikipedia, there are many sections with common titles. These sections often contain similar information and many named entities that one can match 3. This would then allow one to tackle sections with less common titles. We might not learn to translate them, but we could perhaps learn how likely they are to be equivalent. (Using a simple vector base similarity with a threshold)\nI thought that words in an article have neighborhoods that capture meanings. However, there are often alternate versions of the same article in many languages. Translation is generally hard - we must align the words in the source and target. Also, sometimes words are missing or there are extra words.\nA second issue was that the texts in different language editions are not translations but independent works. (Although sometimes an editor will translate a whole or parts of an article rather than write it from scratch.) So, using non-parallel text to learn translation seems like a problem. I was young and optimistic. Surely, over time, more and more of Wikipedia’s articles converge across languages, so there would be many sections with equivalent content. If we could consider them locally, we might tease out a way to learn to translate. Say we could find landmark words like names of places or people we already knew how to translate. If we tracked these in the English and French versions, we get a neighborhood of words more likely to be equivalent if not a translation of each other. The more landmarks we could find, the smaller the neighborhoods would be and the more likely we could find translations or decide that certain neighborhoods are incompatible4. All one would need is to map the text into neighborhoods and then find neighborhoods highly likely to be translations of each other. We might consider the words in their neighborhoods as candidates for translation. This would be easier the more neighborhoods we could translate. 5\nThis seems hopeless at first.\nHowever, the many links in the wiki might hint at how to align certain words.\nI was convinced that learning to translate might be done by considering many problems one at a time. One would start by using cross-language information that links the articles across languages. Collect statistics on neighborhoods for these landmarks. Check their inverse image. (Inverse images of different sizes can detect/fix certain alignment errors.)\nin figure 1\nI had heard about LDA (citationneeded?), which allows the creation of cross-linguistic representations by simply appending similar text in different languages.\nThis was an example of a semantic algorithm.\nI considered that the links in a wiki i.e., between articles, define\nIf we look at the Twitter feeds, we can see that people often tweet the same news in different languages. This is a good source of parallel data. We can run this through a translation model and then use the output to learn alignment and segmentation. It would be even more useful if we captured sequences of tweets about the same news item. In this case, we might look at aligning or predicting emojis.\nIdeally, one would like to learn unsupervised alignment and segmentation by simply deleting parts of one document and then trying to predict the missing parts using the other document. The model could learn to do this better by segmenting and aligning the documents.\nAnother interesting idea is to learn ancillary representation for alignment and segmentation for each language. This is an idea I got from my work on language evolution. Instead of learning the whole grammar, we might try to model the most common short constructs in each language. With a suitable loss function, we might find a pragmatic representation useful for alignment and segmentation for a language pair. Of course, such representations would be useful for other tasks as well.\nThis might be much easier if we provide chunks of decent size for training. We might first use very similar documents (from a parallel corpus) and later move to new articles or papers that are more loosely related.\nSegmentation and Alignment are two related tasks that are often done together and, in this abstract view, more widely applicable than just in translation, e.g., DNA and time series. However, this post will focus primarily on translation.\nI guess the algorithm should need to:\nfind a segment in the source, and decide if\nThe original idea was to use these hints to learn to align the documents at a rough level by providing a rough topology for each document. The open sets would be mappable to each other. They could then be concatenated to learn Latent Semantic Alignment or Latent Dirichlet Allocation.\nTopologies can then be refined by using cross-language word models on the segments deemed to be similar.\nOne tool that might be available today is to use cross-language word embeddings.\nThese should allow us to align the documents at a much finer level.\nWord embeddings are often unavailable for all words, such as names, places, etc. This is where the hints come in. Learning transliteration models can be a second tool that can help.\nA second notion is to develop phrase embeddings. These could be used to better handle one too many mappings arising from the morphological differences between languages.\nA second idea is that once we have alignments, we can learn pooling priors for different constructs and achieve better translation defaults.\nThe Phrase embeddings might have combined a simple structural representation and a semantic representation. The structural representation would be used to align the phrases, and the semantic representation would be used to align the words within the phrases. The semantic representation would be grounded in the same high-dimensional semantic space as the word embeddings.",

In science ideas are often formalized as theories. This statement and behavior of theories have been studied and later formalized using the interrelated mathematical branches of formal languages, logic, set theory and category theory. In other domain like fashion or popular culture we may lack such rigor.\nThe more formaly stated a meme is the fewer minds it can inhabit. But perhpas could",

    "text": "I’ve been learning Hungarian on Duolingo in the last year. Before that I learned in the hungarian Debrecen Summer School for a three courses and before that the full Pimsleur hungarian course. The main problem with Duolingo is that it approach to grammar is nonexistent they explicitly state you should master it by example. This suggest that an innovative idea: add a machine readable grammar that accepts all the content in the course and that rejects what the course rejects. This is then rendered as a human readable document using a script. Unfortunately build a good grammar and making it human readable are both non-trivial tasks at this point in time!?\nI’ve put together this cheat sheet to help accelerate the learning. I hope with more time I’ll also be able to use an LLM to generate more dynamical training regimens then Duolingo can.\nAt this point I have some issues with word order of some sentences. Which I hope to figure out. Talking with native hungarian friends is both amusing and disappointing. They could make no coherent explanation of why the sentences follow that order. One real world issue is that hungarian sentences can have very nuanced meaning based on the word order yet try to translate these meanings to english which does not usually make such nuanced interpretation and the meaning seems nonsensical in many cases or artificial, making you think why would you be saying this where in Hungarian that what that word order has a natural meaning.\nNote that this is an issue when looking at parse trees - it can be a challenge to understand what some different trees actually mean - particularly as an random tree can be drawn it probably wouldn’t necessarily correspond to a sentence in english. To tie this up Hungarian with its flexible word order admits far more parse trees."
