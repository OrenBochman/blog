One of my pet peeves is when some system tasks is much harder on linux than on mac or windows. Linux is expected to shine in system, particularly when using the command line.

# The pain point 

I have a large 12 TB seagate hard-drive and I partitioned it with exfat to allow it to be used with a large partition on mac windows and linux. 
The problems started when in winter power surged. My pc went on but by drives went down in an unclean state.

I soon discovered I could not fix them without rebooting to windows - and running a long scan and repair. I even made a mistake which required a much longer restoration from backup.

Two tools :

# Disks utility

# exfatprogs
