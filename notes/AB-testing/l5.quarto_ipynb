        "\n",
        "The blog post recommended in this lesson explains how \"peeking\" at A/B test results and stopping the experiment based on interim significance can lead to misleading conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the key takeaway:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A/B testing software will often displays \"chance of beating original\" or \"statistical significance\" during the experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   These are estimates with a strong assumption of a fixed sample size set before starting the experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Experiment will switch between favouring A and B many times and as this happens it will loose and then regain statistical significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   If you **Peek** at the data and stopp the experiment early this not only violates the assumption of a fixed sample size it also inflates the reported significance level.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Actually it is much worse is you stop early (e.g., when it first shows significance) you have **cherry picked** the result.\n",
        "    The statistical significance isn't just inflated it is meaningless.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consequences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   You might wrongly conclude that an insignificant difference is actually significant (**false positive**).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Think about it - it is like stopping the election when less than 10% of the votes are counted - there is little reason to think you really seen the big picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The more you peek, the worse the problem gets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solutions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- For experimenters:\n",
        "    -   **Fix the sample size in advance** and stick to it, regardless of interim results.\n",
        "    -   **Avoid peeking** at the data or stopping early.\n",
        "    -   Use the formula `n=16σ²/δ²` as a rule of thumb to estimate the required sample size, considering the desired effect size (`δ`) and expected variance (`σ²`).\n",
        "-For A/B testing software developers:\n",
        "    -   Don't show significance levels until the experiment ends.\n",
        "    -   Instead, report the **detectable effect size** based on current data.\n",
        "    -   Consider removing \"current estimate\" of the treatment effect.\n",
        "- Advanced options:\n",
        "    -   **Sequential experiment design:** Predefined checkpoints to decide on continuing the experiment while maintaining valid significance levels.\n",
        "    -   **Bayesian experiment design:** Allows stopping the experiment and making valid inferences at any time, potentially better suited for real-time web experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Don't rely on preliminary significance indicators in A/B testing dashboards.\n",
        "-   Fix the sample size upfront and avoid peeking at data to ensure reliable results.\n",
        "-   Consider advanced techniques like [sequential](https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html) or [Bayesian designs](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html) for greater flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "A couple of comments:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Most people, data scientists, included don't have a clue estimating statistical power, effect sizes the sample size required to reach significance for an a/b test. Given all that they have even less of a clue on the Practical significance of the test which is what matters in the business setting and what creates the costs for the loosing\n",
        "2.  A Bayesian design is definitely better than the frequentist approach - particularly if it figures in the cost of testing each arm.\n",
        "3.  The only thing in your favour is that you can get an easy win or two if you have not done any a/b testing. Afterwards it gets harder and harder to get a large effect size.\n",
