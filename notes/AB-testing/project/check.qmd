# A/B Testing Final Project Rubric

|Criteria             | Meets Specifications | Exceeds Specifications |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
|Metric Choice||
|Has the student chosen good invariant and evaluation metrics for the experiment? |The student chose a good set of metrics for the experiment, and did not miss any necessary or valuable metrics.|N/A
|Has the student given a well-reasoned justification of their choice of metrics?|All metrics had clear and well-reasoned explanations of why they were or were not chosen.|N/A
|Has the student stated for which results they would launch the experiment?| The student clearly stated what results they were looking for to launch the experiment, and the stated results were aligned with the experiment goals.|N/A
|Variability||
|Is the standard deviation for all evaluation metrics correctly calculated?|The standard deviation for all evaluation metrics is correctly calculated.|N/A|
|Has the student correctly reasoned about whether each analytic standard deviation is likely to be accurate?|Each evaluation metric has a clear and correct explanation of whether the analytic variability is likely to match the empirical variability.|N/A|
|Sizing||
|Does the number of pageviews correctly take into account the planned analysis?| The number of pageviews given is correct given the students choice of whether to use the Bonferroni correction.||N/A
|Has an appropriate level of exposure for the experiment been chosen based on the risk?|The student has made a well-reasoned argument about how risky the experiment will be and chosen a fraction of traffic to divert accordingly.|N/A
|Does the duration of the experiment correctly take the exposure chosen into account?|The duration of the experiment is correctly calculated given the fraction of traffic the student chose to divert.|N/A
|Sanity Checks||
|Has the student correctly performed sanity checks?|The student has correctly calculated sanity checks for all chosen invariant metrics.|N/A|
|Has the student taken the sanity checks into account?|All sanity checks passed or the student did not proceed to the rest of the experiment and analyzed why the sanity checks may have failed.|N/A
|Effect Size Tests||
|Has the student calculated confidence intervals around the difference of all evaluation metrics?|Correctly calculated confidence intervals have been reported for the difference in all evaluation metrics.|N/A|
|Has the student correctly evaluated statistical and practical significance?|Statistical and practical significance have been correctly reported for all evaluation metrics.|N/A|
|Sign Tests||
|Has the student correctly reported a sign test p-value for each evaluation metric and indicated whether the sign test is statistically significant?|P-value and statistical significance have been correctly reported for all evaluation metrics.|N/A|
|Results Summary||
|Has the student correctly chosen whether to use the Bonferroni correction?|The student has given good justification for their choice of whether to use the Bonferroni correction.|N/A|
|Has the student correctly analyzed all discrepancies between the effect size tests and the sign tests?|The student has given well-reasoned and plausible explanations for each discrepancy between the effect size tests and the sign tests.|N/A|
|Recommendation||
|Has the student made a well-reasoned recommendation based on the results of the experiment?|The student has made a recommendation that is well reasoned and supported by the data.|N/A|
|Follow-Up Experiment||
|Has the student chosen a plausible experiment for the purpose given with a clearly stated hypothesis?|The student has described a plausible experiment that would be worth testing and the hypothesis is clearly stated.|The student has described a creative or innovative change that Udacity would be happy to test.
|Has the student chosen good metrics to evaluate the proposed experiment with good reasoning to support them?|The metrics the student has chosen will be sufficient to evaluate the hypothesis of the experiment, would be possible to measure under most infrastructures, and are well-supported by the students reasoning.|N/A
|Has the student chosen a well-reasoned unit of diversion for the experiment?|The student has chosen a reasonable unit of diversion and given good support for their choice.|N/A|
