# Module 3: Temporal Difference Learning Methods for Control

## Lesson 1: TD for Control

-   [ ] Explain how generalized policy iteration can be used with TD to
    find improved policies
-   [ ] Describe the Sarsa Control algorithm
-   [ ] Understand how the Sarsa control algorithm operates in an
    example MDP
-   [ ] Analyze the performance of a learning algorithm

## Lesson 2: Off-policy TD Control: Q-learning

-   [ ] Describe the Q-learning algorithm
-   [ ] Explain the relationship between q-learning and the Bellman
    optimality equations.
-   [ ] Apply q-learning to an MDP to find the optimal policy
-   [ ] Understand how Q-learning performs in an example MDP
-   [ ] Understand the differences between Q-learning and Sarsa
-   [ ] Understand how Q-learning can be off-policy without using
    importance sampling
-   [ ] Describe how the on-policy nature of SARSA and the off-policy
    nature of Q-learning affect their relative performance

## Lesson 3: Expected SARSA

-   [ ] Describe the Expected SARSA algorithm
