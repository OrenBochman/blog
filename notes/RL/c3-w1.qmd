title: Prediction and Control with Function Approximation
subtitle: The K-Armed Bandit Problem
description: In these unit we define some key terms like rewards, states, action, value functions, action values functions. Then we consider at the the multi-armed bandit problem leading to exploration explotation dillema, the epsilon greedy algorithm.
