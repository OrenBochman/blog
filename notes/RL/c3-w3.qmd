## Episodic SARSA with function approximation (Video)

In this video, Adam White, discusses the algorithm for "Episodic SARSA with function approximation". He explains how it can be used to solve reinforcement learning problems with large or continuous state-spaces. He also delineates the importance of feature choices in this algorithm and how they can impact the performance of the system.

## Two ways to construct action dependent features? {#sec-l1g2}

![Stacking](nn-feature-stacking.png){.column-margin}

![Passing](nn-feature-inputs.png){.column-margin}

We see two techniques for constructing action dependent features. It is worthwhile noting that these two techniques are quite generally used in Machine Learning. For example Concatenating is used in CNN and with multi-head attention in Transformers.

1. **Stacking** involves concatenating the state features with the action features. This is a simple and effective way to construct action dependent features. 

Stacking can used both for linear function approximation and for neural networks in much the same way. Stacking is very simple but it has  a problem, it keeps the same state features used for different actions separate. This seems to be both an over-parameterization (i.e. overfitting) and a an impediment to learning a good representation of the state. 

2. **Passing Actions to Features** attempts to remedy this issue. In this technique, the state features are passed through a neural network that also takes the action as input. This allows the network to learn a better representation of the state that is dependent on both the state and the action. This technique is more complex but can lead to better performance.

## How to use SARSA in episodic tasks with function approximation



Next we will [see](#fig-episodic-semi-grafient-sarsa) how to use SARSA in episodic tasks with function approximation. The main idea is to use a similar update rule as before, but with the action value function approximated by a function approximator, i.e. it will be parametrized by weights **w**. Also we will need to add a the gradient of the to the update rule. As we will want to move the weights in the direction of the gradient of the action value function.

SARSA is a sample-based algorithm to solve the Bellman equation for action-values.

- It picks an action based on the current policy and then
- It policy evaluation by a TD updates of Q the action-value function based on the reward and the next action.
- Then it does a policy improvement.

This figure shows the algorithm for Episodic semi-gradient SARSA which uses function approximation. The update rule is modified from tabular case, with an approximate action value function $\hat{q}(s,a,\mathbf{w})$ as well as the inclusion of the gradient of the action value function $\nabla \hat{q} (S_t, A_t, \mathbf{w})$ . These two modification allows us to update the weights of the function approximator The rest of the algorithm remains unchanged.

[@Rummery1994OnlineQU] introduced SARSA, but the name is due to Rich Sutton.

### Questions to consider:

1. Why is this a semi-gradient method?

   Hint: what is the problem with the target of the update rule?

1. Can we do better than this?

  Hint: using [a projected Bellman error](#fig-projected-bellman-error), we may get a better algorithm than SARSA with function approximation.  

1. Do we have any convergence guarantees for SARSA with function approximation?
   
   For the tabular setting, [@singh2000convergence] the authors show that the algorithm has asymptotic converges to the optimal policy provided that the policies from the policy improvement operator is "greedy in the limit with infinite exploration"

   For the function approximation setting, Empirical results show that the linear SARSA can chatter, i.e. the weight vector does not go to infinity (i.e., it does not diverge) but oscillates in a bounded region. 
   
1. Since it is semi-gradient, we are not using the true value of the next state in the update rule.
1. Are we biased?
1. Does this algorithm have lower variance than the TD(0) algorithm?
1. When we choose the next action, are we on policy or off policy?
1. In the non terminal rule we use two samples, but they are highly correlated. Why is this a problem
1. How can we reduce this correlation?
1. What is the policy improvement operator?
1. What is the Lipschitz constant of this operator and why don't we see this in the SARSA algorithm?

## The update for Episodic SARSA with function approximation {#sec-l1g1}

So far we have only been using function approximation to parametrize state value function,

$$
V_\pi(s) ≈ \hat{v}(s,w) \ \dot = \ \mathbf{w}^T \cdot \mathbf{x}(S) \qquad
$$ {#eq-parametize-state-value-function}

For SARSA we need a parametrized approximation $\hat{q}$ for the the action value function $q_pi$,

$$
q_\pi(s,a) ≈ \hat{q}(s,a,\mathbf{w}) \ \dot = \ \mathbf{w}^T \cdot \mathbf{x}(s,a) \qquad
$$ {#eq-parametrized-action-value-function}

## Feature Choices in Episodic SARSA with Function Approximation 

![tile coding](mountain-car-feature-representations.png){.column-margin}

What features do we use for the mountain car problem?

for the state:

- position
- velocity

for the action:

- accelerate left
- accelerate right
- do nothing

## Visualizing Value Function and Learning Curves {#sec-l1g3}

![](mountain-car-learned-values.png){.column-margin}

![](mountain-car-learned-values-trajectory.png){.column-margin}

![](mountain-car-learning-curve.png){.column-margin}

The first two figures show the learned value function for the mountain car problem. The first figure shows the value function for each state. The second shows a possible trajectory through the state space.

Then we look at the learning curve for the mountain car problem. This shows how the value function improves over time as the agent learns the optimal policy. We see the familiar exponential decay in the learning curves. 

It worth noting that this is a very simple environment and that many more sophisticated deep learning techniques don't do a very good job on this problem.

## Expected SARSA with Function Approximation (Video)

Now we extend SARSA with under function approximation into Expected SARSA . 

First, recall the update rule for Tabular SARSA:

$$
Q(S_t,A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha (R_{t+1} + \gamma Q( \textcolor{red}{ S_{t+1}, A_{t+1} }) - Q(S_t,A_t)) \qquad
$$ {#eq-tabular-sarsa-update}

SARSA's update target includes the action value for the next state in action.

Next, recall how Tabular Expected SARSA uses the expectation over its target policy instead.

$$
Q(S_t,A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha (R_{t+1} + \gamma \textcolor{red}{ \sum_{a'} \pi (a' \mid S_{t+1}) Q(S_{t+1},a')} - Q(S_t,A_t)) \qquad
$$ {#eq-tabular-expected-sarsa-update}

We can compute the same expectation using function approximation. 

First, recall the update for SARSA with function approximation. 
It looks similar to the tabular setting except the action value estimates are parameterized by the weight factor, $\mathbf{w}$. i.e. $q_\pi (s, a) \approx \hat{q} (s, a, \mathbf{w})$

$$
\mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma \hat{q}(\textcolor{red} { S_{t+1} } , \textcolor{red} { A_{t+1}}, \mathbf{w}) - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, \mathbf{w})] \nabla \hat{q} (S_t, A_t, \mathbf{w}) \qquad
$$ {#eq-semi-gradient-sarsa-update}

Expected Sarsa with function approximation follows a similar structure.

$$
\mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma   \textcolor{red}{ \sum_{a'} \pi( a' \mid S_{t+1}) \hat{q} (S_{t+1}, a' , \mathbf{w} )} - \hat{q}(S_t , A_t , \mathbf{w})] \nabla \hat{q}(S_t , A_t , \mathbf{w}) \qquad
$$ {#eq-semi-gradient-expected-sarsa-update}

## How this extends to Q-learning easily, since it is a subset of Expected SARSA {#sec-l1g4}

Finally, for Q-learning with function approximation as Q-learning is a special case of expected Sarsa in which we take the greedy. So next we replace the expectation over the target policy by argmax action to derive the Q-learning update rule. 

The Q-learning update rule is:

$$
\mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma  \textcolor{red}{ \max_{a'} \hat{q}(S_{t+1},a',\mathbf{w})} −\hat{q}(S_t,A_t,\mathbf{w})] \nabla \hat{q}(S_t,A_t,\mathbf{w}) \qquad
$$ {#eq-semi-gradient-Q-learning-update}

:::

## Exploration under Function Approximation (Video)

## Optimistic Initialization as a Form of Exploration {#sec-l2g1}

In the tabular setting, we saw that we could use optimistic initialization as a form of early exploration. The way this works is that we initialize the value function to be very high, this way the agent will be encouraged to try to exploit one of the states. It will discover that the value of the state is not as high as it thought and will try to exploit another and so on until it have visited all the states and learned more realistic values for them. Over time the effect of the initial values will diminish. This however assumes two things:

1. the number of states is finite
2. the values are independent of each other

In the function approximation setting, we can try to do the same thing. This time we will want to initialize the weights so as to make the value function high. We face a number of issues in this setting:

1. the values are not independent of each other so each weight may loose its optimistic value long before the agent has explored many of the states  within the features neighborhood in the state space.
2. Unlike values we can't be certain that high weights will lead to high values. While this may work for linear function approximation, for a non-linear function approximation using Neural Networks with tanh activation functions, positive weights may lead to negative values.

epsilon-greedy exploration is easy to implement even with non-linear function approximation. However it is not as effective in the function approximation setting. Because it relies on randomness to explore states near those followed by the current policy. This is not as systematic as the exploration due to optimistic initialization in the tabular setting.

Improving exploration with function approximation is an open research question

In this course we will stick to epsilon-greedy exploration. However the last video by Satinder Singh discusses using intrinsic motivation to improve exploration in reinforcement learning systems. And in it he shows a different paradigm of exploration. Rather than getting agents to explore systematic one wants to explore in a way that is interesting to the agent.

# Lesson 3: Average Reward

- [x] *Explain* when average reward optimal policies are different from discounted solutions [\#](#sec-l3g2)
- [x] *Understand* how differential value functions are different from discounted value functions [\#](#sec-l3g3)
:::

## Average Reward: A New Way of Formulating Control Problems  (Video)

## The Average Reward Setting {#sec-l3g1}

$$
r(\pi) \dot = \lim _{h \to \infty} \frac{1}{h} \sum_{t=1}^{h} \mathbb{E}[R_t S_0,A_{0:t−1} ≈ \pi]  \qquad
$$ {#eq-average-reward}

We can write the average reward using the state visitation, μ. This inner term is the expected reward in a state under policy \pi. The outer sum takes the expectation over how frequently the policy is in that state. Together, we get the expected reward across states. In other words, the average reward for a policy


$$
r(\pi) = \sum_{s} \mu_\pi (s) \sum_{a} \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{r,s'} p(r,s' \mid s,a) r
$$ {#eq-average-reward-visitation}

In the average reward setting, returns are defined in terms of differences between rewards and the average reward $r_\pi$, which is called the differential return. The differential return represents how much more reward the agent will receive from the current state in action compared to the average reward of the policy.

$$
G_t = R_{t+1} −r_\pi + R_{t+2} −r_\pi + R_{t+2} −r_\pi \ldots \qquad
$$ {#eq-differential-return}

The differential return represents how much better it is to take an action in a state then on average under a certain policy. The differential return can only be used to compare actions if the same policy is followed on subsequent time steps. To compare policies, their average reward should be used instead


This quantity captures how much more reward the agent will get by starting in a particular state than it would get on average over all states if it followed a fixed policy.
$$
q_\pi(s,a) = E_\pi[G_t|S_t = s,A_t = a] \qquad
$$ {#eq-differential-value-function}

Like in the discounted setting, differential value functions can be written as Bellman equations. They only differ in that they subtract r(\pi) from the immediate reward and there is no discounting.
$$
q_\pi(s,a) = \sum_{s',r} p(s',r \mid s,a)(r −r(\pi)) + \sum_{a'} \pi(a' \mid s')q_\pi(s',a') \qquad
$$ {#eq-differential-bellman}

Many algorithms from the discounted case can be rewritten to apply to the average reward case.
