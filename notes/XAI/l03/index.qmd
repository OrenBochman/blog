title:  3 Explaining Deep Neural Network Models
subtitle: XAI Course Notes
description: |
  Rigorously understanding how Deep Learning models function may allow us to steer and control their behavior and avoid unwanted consequences. 
  In addition, todayâ€™s highly capable AI systems could be useful for studying intelligence. 
  Can we reverse engineer neural nets from their weights, similar to how one might reverse engineer a binary compiled program? 
  Can we gain insights into neural computation similar to how neuroscientists study the brain?
