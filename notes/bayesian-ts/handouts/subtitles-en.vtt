00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.225
In this second example,

2
00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:11.130
we are going to have
two components;

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:22.980
a linear trend plus a
seasonal component where

4
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.110
the fundamental period is four.

5
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.050
The way to build
this model, again,

6
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.270
is using the
superposition principle.

7
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.450
We first think about what
is the structure we need

8
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.115
to have a linear trend in
the FORECAST function.

9
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.640
The linear trend is

10
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.490
a linear function on the
number of steps ahead.

11
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.240
Whenever you have
that structured,

12
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.975
you are going to have a DLM

13
00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:02.345
that is the so-called
polynomial model of order 2,

14
00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.380
so let's discuss
first the linear.

15
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.840
Let's say the linear trend
part, and in this case,

16
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.610
we have an F and a G,

17
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.130
I'm going to call them 1,

18
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370
F_1 and G_1 to denote that this

19
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.320
is the first component
in the model.

20
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.135
F_1 is just going to
be 1, 0 transpose,

21
00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:42.120
and the G_1 is that
upper triangular matrix,

22
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.075
it's a 2 by 2 matrix that has 1,

23
00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:47.430
1 in the first row, 0,

24
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.915
1 in the second row,

25
00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:50.835
so this gives me a linear trend.

26
00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:53.200
My forecast function,

27
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.210
let's call it f_1t in terms of

28
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.100
the number of steps ahead is

29
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.665
just a linear function on h,

30
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:07.105
is a linear polynomial order 1.

31
00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:12.700
Let's say it's a constant
of K but depends on

32
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.650
t0 plus K_t1 h.

33
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.700
This is the structure
of the first component.

34
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.620
Then I have to think about

35
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.680
the seasonal component
with period of four.

36
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.560
If we are going to incorporate
all the harmonics,

37
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.760
we have to think again,

38
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.775
is this an even period
or a not period?

39
00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:37.010
In this example, this
is an even period.

40
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.505
I can write p, which is 4,

41
00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:44.925
as 2 times 2,

42
00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.320
so this gives me that

43
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.330
m. I'm going to
have one frequency,

44
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.575
the first one, Omega 1,

45
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:58.480
is related to the
fundamental period of 4,

46
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.715
so is 2 Pi over 4,

47
00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:05.200
which I can simplify and
write down this as Pi over 2.

48
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.760
This is the first frequency.

49
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.190
The last one is going to
correspond to the Nyquist.

50
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.810
We could obtain that
doing 4Pi over 4,

51
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.300
which is just Pi.

52
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.055
As you remember,

53
00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:23.070
this component is going to

54
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.610
require a two-dimensional
DLM component model,

55
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.229
this one is going to require

56
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.500
a one-dimensional DLM
component model in terms

57
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.180
of the dimension here is

58
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.310
the dimension of
the state vectors.

59
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.745
When we build this
concatenating these components,

60
00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:43.115
we are going to have, again,

61
00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:46.040
let's call it F_2 and

62
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.660
G_2 for this
particular component.

63
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.680
I had called this here
a, let's call this b.

64
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.680
My F_2 has that E_2
transpose and a 1,

65
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.345
which gives me just 1, 0, 1.

66
00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:18.345
My G matrix is going
to be a 3 by 3 matrix.

67
00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:20.770
The first component is

68
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.500
the component associated to
that fundamental period.

69
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.645
It's a block diagonal again,

70
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:40.010
and I'm going to have
that J_2, 1 Omega 1,

71
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.780
and then I have my minus 1 here.

72
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.320
What this means is if I
write this down as a matrix,

73
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.715
let me write it here,

74
00:04:53.715 --> 00:05:03.940
G_2 is going to be cosine
of that Pi halves,

75
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.835
and then I have zeros here,

76
00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:29.080
I have my minus 1
here, 0, and 0.

77
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.680
I can further simplify these
to have this structure.

78
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.775
The cosine of Pi halves
is 0, the sine is 1,

79
00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:42.570
so I can write this
down as 0, 1, 0,

80
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:51.015
minus 1, 0, 0, and 0, 0 minus 1.

81
00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:54.100
Now if I want to go back

82
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.220
to just having a model
that has both components,

83
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.920
I use the superposition
principle again and

84
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.045
combine this component
with this component.

85
00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:12.350
The linear plus seasonal

86
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.100
is a model that is going to
have the representation F,

87
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.910
G, with F is going to be

88
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:41.310
just concatenate F_1 and F_2.

89
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.460
G now has that block
diagonal form again.

90
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.090
If I look at what I have,

91
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.560
I have this block
that is a 2 by 2,

92
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.985
this block that is a 3 by 3.

93
00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:03.190
Therefore my model
is going to be

94
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.500
a five-dimensional model in

95
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.720
terms of the state
parameter vector,

96
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.910
so this G is a 5 by 5,

97
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.925
and this one is also a
five-dimensional vector.

98
00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:16.110
Finally, if I think about

99
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.150
the forecast function
in this case,

100
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.585
if I call here the
forecast function

101
00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:25.590
f_2t for the component
that is seasonal,

102
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.140
I'm going to have my A_t1 cosine

103
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.280
of Pi halves h plus B_t1,

104
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:46.830
and then I have my
A_t2 minus 1^h.

105
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.385
My forecast function
for the final model

106
00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:53.250
is going to be just the sum
of these two components.

107
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.460
You can see how I can now put
together all these blocks,

108
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.560
so I have a block that
is seasonal and a block

109
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.195
that is a linear
polynomial model,

110
00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:17.660
and I can put them
together in a single model

111
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.135
just to create a more
flexible structure.

112
00:08:20.135 --> 00:08:22.220
You could add
regression components,

113
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.615
you could add autoregressive
components and put together

114
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:29.150
as many components
as you need for

115
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.665
the forecast function to have

116
00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:33.600
the form that you
expect it to have.

117
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.870
All of these models
are using, again,

118
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.880
the superposition principle and

119
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.320
the fact that we're working with

120
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.360
a linear and Gaussian
structure in

121
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.880
terms of doing the
posterior inference later.
