These is the first installment of notes to the course "Deep Neural Networks" by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) I took on Coursera

This was one of the first course online on the subject.

Hinton was one of the leading researchers on deep learning, his students are some of the most important reaserchers today.
He introduced some algorithms and methods that were not published.

This course is now outdated - it does not cover transformers and probably all the results have been beaten as this is a fast moving field.

Still this is an interesting, if mathematicaly sophisticated introduction to deep learning.
