        "\n",
        "ABMs are easy to code, particularly when we know an ABM framework. ABMs can be iteratively refined or simplified. ABMs can be made interactive - which facilitates quick exploratory analysis. ABMs are amenable to automated analysis. Which might reveal optimal strategies that let us proceed to a Game Theoretical model Alternatively, we might use them to formalize the model by deriving some equations that describe the emergent macroscopic behavior. The agents may also be given the capacity to learn more optimal behavior using RL (reinforcement learning). ABM may be tested for their capacity to match real-world phenomena. ABM models that are a good fit can also be calibrated to match the behavior in observed data more closely.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, there are many Formal Contagion models that use PDEs to model epidemics. While SIRX models can just as easily handle billions of patients as thousands. However, they cannot be readily queried to check the effectiveness of different mitigation methods for a disease. ABMs, Although limited to 100,000 agents, were used to explore mitigations in various scenarios like nursing homes, primary schools, secondary schools, and even prisons. They were also modified to match specific cases and calibrated using a few real test cases.\n",

        "\n",
        "The insights of simulating Schelling's model are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Segregation and other emergent macro-level effects may not reflect the behavior and preferences of individuals at the micro level. We see that individuals who are happy so long as they live with just a minimal proportion of their ethnic group within their vicinity will ultimately find themselves in a state of pronounced segregation.\n",
        "2.  Segregation actually breaks down if intolerance gets too high enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this course, we will return to the idea of tipping points. But lacking a clear definition makes the discussions rather pedestrian at times.\n",
        "\n",
        "I like to think of a tipping point as a critical point in systems dynamics at which there is a discontinuity in macroscopic behavior. Phase changes are best understood in physical systems, where we often find that they have higher-dimensional geometry since the phase change depends on multiple factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "What Scott calls \"a tip\" is more straightforward to understand if we call it \"a cascade,\" which I define as \"a chain reaction or sequence of events arising from a single cause.\" Not all models exhibit cascades, but when they do, they are a significant part of how the micro is transformed into the macro.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, the simulation I looked at in NetLogo and Mesa doesn't show how to keep track of cascades and visualize them in real time. The **tipping points** in this model are the thresholds described above at which we will see large-scale segregation emerge, and the second one is where it stops, and we see permanent churn emerge. What are described below are cascades.\n",
        "\n",
        "Schelling's model has a cascade phenomenon. For example, if one person moves, this may trigger another person to move, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   There is an **Exodus cascade**, which means that a person will leave if a similar person in the neighborhood leaves. The trigger for this cascade for $X$ is due to a like-me neighbor leaving and thus decrementing the numerator of the ‚Äòthreshold‚Äô equation from $N/D$, which is still happy, to $(N-1)/D$, which is no longer happy, thus triggering $X$'s move. These exodus cascades will start with the most intolerant neighbor of $X$, but others with lower thresholds may follow dropping.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   There is also a **Genesis cascade**, in which a person at $X$ could become unhappy if a \"different\" type of person moves into one of the vacant apartments in his neighborhood, $Y$. This will happen if $X$‚Äôs threshold is triggered by a denominator increase, i.e., $X$ was happy at $N/D < T$, but at $N/(D+1) >= T$, $X$ is no longer happy. Genesis events may cascade if more individuals like $Y$ move into the mixed neighborhood, occupying additional vacant apartments nearby. They can trigger an exodus cascade, creating more vacant lots and clearing the way for further genesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most major urban centers with individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds, there exists a pronounced segregation along racial lines despite the prevalent desire among the populace to reside in ethnically mixed communities.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **The threshold** is held fixed in this model, but in reality, it is a distribution.\n",
        "2.  The rich are a minority & the poor are a majority in most cities.\n",
        "3.  The model is biased in the sense that an agent only get unhappy due to lack of self same neighbors. We can just as easily let them get unhappy if there is no diversity by adding a threshold for that. This should allow people to move nearer to the segregated zone or perhaps into an integrated area. This might make the boundaries expand or even setup zones of higher and lower homogeneity.\n",
