## Pre-requisite self assessment quiz 

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

1. let $X$ be a normal random variable with mean equal to one and variance equal to four. Using statistical software if needed, answer the following two questions:

## Q1

Enter the probability that $X$ X is no more  than one, 
$P(X≤1)$ :


```{r}
(pnorm(1, mean=1, sd=2))
```

## Q2


Enter the probability that $X$ X is no less than minus two, 
$P(X\ge-2)$ :



```{r}
(1-pnorm(-2, mean=1, sd=2))
```

$N(x)=P(Z≤x)$ denotes the probability that a standard normal random variable $Z$ is no more than $x$. 

Consider the probability

$$
P(a e^{bZ+c} \ge d).
$$ 
## Q3

Here, $a,b,c,d$ are positive constants and $e^x$  is the exponential function.

What is the expression for that probability in terms of function $N(x)$?


$$
P(a e^{bZ+c} \ge d) = N\left( \frac{c- \log(d) + \log(a) }{b}\right)
$$


## Q4

Consider the function 

$$
f(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-m)^2}.
$$
 
Knowing that the integral of $cf(x)$ from minus infinity to plus infinity is equal to one, what is the value of c

since the formula for the normal distribution is

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$
we substitute $\mu = m$ and $\sigma = 1$ to get

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-m)^2}
$$

since this is a distribution, the integral of $f(x)$ from minus infinity to plus infinity is equal to one.

Therefore, the constant $c$ is equal to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$.

what is 

$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} cxf(x) dx$ equal to?

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} cxf(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-m)^2} dx
$$
but this is the expected value of the normal distribution, which is equal to the mean of the distribution. Therefore, the integral is equal to $m$.


## Q5

f(t) be the solution to the ordinary differential equation

$$
f'(t) = 2 f(t)
$$

with the boundary condition 
 
$$
f(0) = 3
$$

the a solution to this differential equation is of the form

$$
f(t) = e^{2t} + c
$$

substitute the boundary condition  $f(0) = 3$ to get the value of the constant $c$: as 

$$
f(0) =  e^{2*0} + c = 1 + c = 3 \implies c = 2
$$
Therefore, the exact solution to the differential equation is

$$
f(t) = e^{2t} + 2
$$

Enter the numerical value value of $f(0)$:

```{r}
f <- function(t) {
  return(exp(2*t) + 2)
}
f(1)
f(0)

```

## 6 

Consider the function 

$$
f(x,y) = x^2 y^3.
$$

Enter the value of its derivative with respect to $y$ at the point $(x=2, y=3)$
 
the derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ is

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3x^2y^2
$$
substitute $x=2$ and $y=3$ to get

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3(2)^2(3)^2 = 3*4*9 = 108
$$

## Q7
the second partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ and $x$ is

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = 6xy^2
$$

substitute $x=2$ and $y=3$ to get

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = 6(2)(3)^2 = 6*2*9 = 108
$$

## Q8

X be a random variable that takes values 0, 1 and 2 with probabilities 1/4, 1/4 and 1/2, respectively.

Enter the numerical value for the expected value of 

$$
E[X]
$$
$$
E[X] = 0*\frac{1}{4} + 1*\frac{1}{4} + 2*\frac{1}{2} = 0 + 0.25 + 1 = 1.25
$$
## Q9

Enter the numerical value for the variance of X $Var[X]$:

$$
\begin{align*}
Var[X]
  & = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \\ 
  & = 0^2*\frac{1}{4} + 1^2*\frac{1}{4} + 2^2*\frac{1}{2} - (1.25)^2 \\
  & = 0 + 0.25 + 2 - 1.5625 \\
  & = 0.6875
\end{align*}
$$

## Q10

Let 
$$
g(x) = f(x, y(x))
$$
where $y(x)$ is a function of $x$ and $f(x,y)$ is a function of two variables. Denote the derivative of $y(x)$ with respect to $x$ by $y_x$, the derivative of $f$ with respect to the first variable, and evaluated at the point $(x, y(x))$, by $f_x$, and the derivative of $f$ with respect to the second variable, and evaluated at the point $(x, y(x))$, by $f_y$.

Write, in terms of only $y_x, f_x, f_y$, the derivative of the function $g(x) = f(x, y(x))$ with respect to $x$. Explicitly indicate multiplication with a "*" symbol, and write the derivatives as y_x, f_x, f_y.

$$
\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = f_x + f_y*y_x
$$
where I used the chain rule for differentiation.
