In this updated post I included some R books you might want to look at if you are getting started with R for data science


Fellow data scientists, do not be overwhelmed by vast multiplicities of numbers, for they are but symbols of the natural order. Embrace their uncertainty and seek to understand the patterns within it. I offer you some of the first R books I came across. I got started with R in 2011, and I decided to update it to focus on stats and ml books I've come across with an attempt to list my favorites with their lecture notes and video lectures where available.

In [@davidson-1996] the author offers a guide to the foundations of this field, including **exploratory data analysis**, **hypothesis testing**, and **model building**. Through careful attention and disciplined study, one can cultivate a deep understanding of the methods and techniques that underlie *statistical data handling*, and by following, we shall approach data with a rational and objective mindset, illuminating with our analytical skills the meaningful insights and so make more informed decisions.

A Stoic would say "Remember, the data is not what you see, but what you make of it. So, approach it with a clear mind, free from **bias** and preconceptions, and seek the truth that lies hidden within." By applying oneself to these principles with diligence and perseverance, we may yet unlock the full potential of *statistical data handling*, and make a valuable contribution to the world of data science.

In [@Kerns2018], recommended by my old friend Adam Hyland, the author covers the basic concepts of probability and statistics using the *R programming language*.

It is a useful resource for data scientists who wish to gain a deeper understanding of probability and statistics and how to apply them.

Starting with basic probability, **distributions**, **hypothesis testing**, **regression analysis**, it then proceeds to more advanced topics such as **Bayesian statistics**, **machine learning**, and **time series analysis**.

Each chapter presents clear explanations, examples, and R code to help the reader grasp the theoretical concepts and apply them in practice. By including a wide range of real-world examples and datasets, it helps the readers conect the concepts and techniques with thier application to real data.

:::

In [@RizzoMariaL2019ScwR] the author presents is a comprehensive guide to the analysis and manipulation of data using R. Within, we are introduced to a wide variety of statistical concepts and tools that enable us to explore and understand complex datasets.

Standard statistical techniques used in data analysis, such as **probability**, **hypothesis testing** are covered. We learn about the **normal distribution** and its importance in statistical analysis, as well as the **Poisson distribution**, which is used to model counts of events.

The book introduces us to the use of **statistical transformations**, such as the log transformation, which is often used to make skewed data more normal. We also learn about **density estimation** and the use of histograms and kernel density estimates to visualize data.

The concepts of **sampling** and **random variables** are explored, as well as the calculation of **sample means** and **standard errors**. We also learn about the use of random samples from **Monte Carlo simulation** to approximate probabilities and calculate statistics.

The book covers the use of algorithms and samplers, such as the **Metropolis-Hastings** algorithm, to explore parameter space and to generate samples from distributions of interest. We learn about the importance of convergence and the use of proposals in Monte Carlo sampling.

The concepts of **bias** and **variance** are explored, as well as the calculation of **confidence intervals** and the use of **hypothesis testing** to evaluate **statistical significance**. We also learn about the use of the **bootstrap** and **jackknife** methods to find the level of uncertainty in our estimates.

Throughout the book, we are introduced to the use of R for statistical computing. We learn about the use of formulas to specify statistical models, as well as the use of packages for data manipulation and visualization.

Overall, "Statistical Computing with R" is an essential resource for anyone interested in using statistical methods to analyze data. It provides a lucid and comprehensive treatment of statistical concepts and their practical implementation using R.

## Bayesian methods of Data Analysis

:::

In [@carlin2008bayesian] the author presents us with a framework that is grounded in the philosophy of probability theory. We learn to seek a baseline model then approach the problem at hand with a Bayesian perspective.

Through the use of **Bayesian models**, we can compute the **conditional distributions** of our data and evaluate the error and loss functions. We must consider convergence, the **choice of priors**, and how they are specified. We use **Bayes' rule** to compute the **posterior distribution** and **marginal likelihood**, and we obtain **point estimates** and **credible intervals**.

The use of the **Gibbs sampler** and the **Metropolis-Hastings** algorithm in **MCMC** methods are presented as tools to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution. We use **WinBUGS** code and **Monte Carlo** simulations to produce results that are in line with the data observed.

We are introduced to the concept of the **Bayes factor**, and how it is used to compare models. We also understand how the use of the **Jeffreys prior**, the **hyperprior**, and the **conjugate prior** can be used to simplify our computations.

In Bayesian methods, we use the full conditional distributions to obtain the joint posterior distribution of our parameters. We also compute the marginal posterior distribution, which can be used to obtain a credible interval.

We are shown how to deal with univariate and multivariate data, and how to model the **random effects** and **covariate effects**. We also understand how to evaluate the performance of our models through **histograms**, **percentiles**, and **plots**.

In this work, we are presented with a practical and useful guide to Bayesian methods that can be applied to a variety of problems.

[Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) [@MacKay2003] by David J.C. MacKay FRS - [Course notes: Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks](http://videolectures.net/mackay_course_01).

This is not an R book as far as I recall but it is available online, together with lectures by the author. I recommend this book and videos for anyone interested bayesian data analysis. The author was a physicist, a leading bayesian and pioneer in Bayesian Neural Networks whose work is very relavant even today (2024)
