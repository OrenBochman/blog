1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,"Since I came to this place I have been very restless, wasting my"
1047,"energies in the futile beginning of ill-conceived books. One does not"
1047,"settle down very readily at two and forty to a new way of living, and"
1047,"I have found myself with the teeming interests of the life I have"
1047,"abandoned still buzzing like a swarm of homeless bees in my head. My"
1047,"mind has been full of confused protests and justifications. In any case"
1047,"I should have found difficulties enough in expressing the complex thing"
1047,"I have to tell, but it has added greatly to my trouble that I have a"
1047,"great analogue, that a certain Niccolo Machiavelli chanced to fall out"
1047,"of politics at very much the age I have reached, and wrote a book to"
1047,"engage the restlessness of his mind, very much as I have wanted to do."
1047,"He wrote about the relation of the great constructive spirit in politics"
1047,"to individual character and weaknesses, and so far his achievement lies"
1047,"like a deep rut in the road of my intention. It has taken me far astray."
1047,"It is a matter of many weeks now--diversified indeed by some long drives"
1047,"into the mountains behind us and a memorable sail to Genoa across the"
1047,"blue and purple waters that drowned Shelley--since I began a laboured"
1047,"and futile imitation of ""The Prince."" I sat up late last night with the"
1047,"jumbled accumulation; and at last made a little fire of olive twigs and"
1047,"burnt it all, sheet by sheet--to begin again clear this morning."
1047,""
1047,"But incidentally I have re-read most of Machiavelli, not excepting those"
1047,"scandalous letters of his to Vettori, and it seems to me, now that I"
1047,"have released myself altogether from his literary precedent, that he"
1047,"still has his use for me. In spite of his vast prestige I claim kindred"
1047,"with him and set his name upon my title-page, in partial intimation of"
1047,"the matter of my story. He takes me with sympathy not only by reason"
1047,"of the dream he pursued and the humanity of his politics, but by the"
1047,"mixture of his nature. His vices come in, essential to my issue. He is"
1047,"dead and gone, all his immediate correlations to party and faction have"
1047,"faded to insignificance, leaving only on the one hand his broad method"
1047,"and conceptions, and upon the other his intimate living personality,"
1047,"exposed down to its salacious corners as the soul of no contemporary can"
1047,"ever be exposed. Of those double strands it is I have to write, of the"
1047,"subtle protesting perplexing play of instinctive passion and desire"
1047,"against too abstract a dream of statesmanship. But things that seemed to"
1047,"lie very far apart in Machiavelli's time have come near to one another;"
1047,"it is no simple story of white passions struggling against the red that"
1047,"I have to tell."
1047,""
1047,"The state-making dream is a very old dream indeed in the world's"
1047,"history. It plays too small a part in novels. Plato and Confucius"
1047,"are but the highest of a great host of minds that have had a kindred"
1047,"aspiration, have dreamt of a world of men better ordered, happier,"
1047,"finer, securer. They imagined cities grown more powerful and peoples"
1047,"made rich and multitudinous by their efforts, they thought in terms"
1047,"of harbours and shining navies, great roads engineered marvellously,"
1047,"jungles cleared and deserts conquered, the ending of muddle and"
1047,"diseases and dirt and misery; the ending of confusions that waste human"
1047,"possibilities; they thought of these things with passion and desire as"
1047,"other men think of the soft lines and tender beauty of women. Thousands"
1047,"of men there are to-day almost mastered by this white passion of"
1047,"statecraft, and in nearly every one who reads and thinks you could find,"
1047,"I suspect, some sort of answering response. But in every one it presents"
1047,"itself extraordinarily entangled and mixed up with other, more intimate"
1047,"things."
1047,""
1047,"It was so with Machiavelli. I picture him at San Casciano as he lived"
1047,"in retirement upon his property after the fall of the Republic, perhaps"
1047,"with a twinge of the torture that punished his conspiracy still lurking"
1047,"in his limbs. Such twinges could not stop his dreaming. Then it was ""The"
1047,"Prince"" was written. All day he went about his personal affairs,"
1047,"saw homely neighbours, dealt with his family, gave vent to everyday"
1047,"passions. He would sit in the shop of Donato del Corno gossiping"
1047,"curiously among vicious company, or pace the lonely woods of his estate,"
1047,"book in hand, full of bitter meditations. In the evening he returned"
1047,"home and went to his study. At the entrance, he says, he pulled off his"
1047,"peasant clothes covered with the dust and dirt of that immediate life,"
1047,"washed himself, put on his ""noble court dress,"" closed the door on"
1047,"the world of toiling and getting, private loving, private hating and"
1047,"personal regrets, sat down with a sigh of contentment to those wider"
1047,"dreams."
1047,""
1047,"I like to think of him so, with brown books before him lit by the light"
1047,"of candles in silver candlesticks, or heading some new chapter of ""The"
1047,"Prince,"" with a grey quill in his clean fine hand."
1047,""
1047,"So writing, he becomes a symbol for me, and the less none because of his"
1047,"animal humour, his queer indecent side, and because of such lapses"
1047,"into utter meanness as that which made him sound the note of the"
1047,"begging-letter writer even in his ""Dedication,"" reminding His"
1047,"Magnificence very urgently, as if it were the gist of his matter, of the"
1047,"continued malignity of fortune in his affairs. These flaws complete him."
1047,"They are my reason for preferring him as a symbol to Plato, of whose"
1047,"indelicate side we know nothing, and whose correspondence with Dionysius"
1047,"of Syracuse has perished; or to Confucius who travelled China in search"
1047,"of a Prince he might instruct, with lapses and indignities now lost"
1047,"in the mists of ages. They have achieved the apotheosis of individual"
1047,"forgetfulness, and Plato has the added glory of that acquired beauty,"
1047,"that bust of the Indian Bacchus which is now indissolubly mingled with"
1047,"his tradition. They have passed into the world of the ideal, and every"
1047,"humbug takes his freedoms with their names. But Machiavelli, more recent"
1047,"and less popular, is still all human and earthly, a fallen brother--and"
1047,"at the same time that nobly dressed and nobly dreaming writer at the"
1047,"desk."
1047,""
1047,"That vision of the strengthened and perfected state is protagonist in"
1047,"my story. But as I re-read ""The Prince"" and thought out the manner of"
1047,"my now abandoned project, I came to perceive how that stir and whirl of"
1047,"human thought one calls by way of embodiment the French Revolution, has"
1047,"altered absolutely the approach to such a question. Machiavelli, like"
1047,"Plato and Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd decades before him,"
1047,"saw only one method by which a thinking man, himself not powerful, might"
1047,"do the work of state building, and that was by seizing the imagination"
1047,"of a Prince. Directly these men turned their thoughts towards"
1047,"realisation, their attitudes became--what shall I call it?--secretarial."
1047,"Machiavelli, it is true, had some little doubts about the particular"
1047,"Prince he wanted, whether it was Caesar Borgia of Giuliano or Lorenzo,"
1047,"but a Prince it had to be. Before I saw clearly the differences of our"
1047,"own time I searched my mind for the modern equivalent of a Prince. At"
1047,"various times I redrafted a parallel dedication to the Prince of"
1047,"Wales, to the Emperor William, to Mr. Evesham, to a certain newspaper"
1047,"proprietor who was once my schoolfellow at City Merchants', to Mr. J. D."
1047,"Rockefeller--all of them men in their several ways and circumstances and"
1047,"possibilities, princely. Yet in every case my pen bent of its own accord"
1047,"towards irony because--because, although at first I did not realise it,"
1047,"I myself am just as free to be a prince. The appeal was unfair. The old"
1047,"sort of Prince, the old little principality has vanished from the world."
1047,"The commonweal is one man's absolute estate and responsibility no more."
1047,"In Machiavelli's time it was indeed to an extreme degree one man's"
1047,"affair. But the days of the Prince who planned and directed and was"
1047,"the source and centre of all power are ended. We are in a condition of"
1047,"affairs infinitely more complex, in which every prince and statesman is"
1047,"something of a servant and every intelligent human being something of"
1047,"a Prince. No magnificent pensive Lorenzos remain any more in this world"
1047,"for secretarial hopes."
1047,""
1047,"In a sense it is wonderful how power has vanished, in a sense wonderful"
1047,"how it has increased. I sit here, an unarmed discredited man, at a small"
1047,"writing-table in a little defenceless dwelling among the vines, and no"
1047,"human being can stop my pen except by the deliberate self-immolation of"
1047,"murdering me, nor destroy its fruits except by theft and crime. No King,"
1047,"no council, can seize and torture me; no Church, no nation silence me."
1047,"Such powers of ruthless and complete suppression have vanished. But that"
1047,"is not because power has diminished, but because it has increased and"
1047,"become multitudinous, because it has dispersed itself and specialised."
1047,"It is no longer a negative power we have, but positive; we cannot"
1047,"prevent, but we can do. This age, far beyond all previous ages, is full"
1047,"of powerful men, men who might, if they had the will for it, achieve"
1047,"stupendous things."
1047,""
1047,"The things that might be done to-day! The things indeed that are being"
1047,"done! It is the latter that give one so vast a sense of the former. When"
1047,"I think of the progress of physical and mechanical science, of medicine"
1047,"and sanitation during the last century, when I measure the increase in"
1047,"general education and average efficiency, the power now available"
1047,"for human service, the merely physical increment, and compare it with"
1047,"anything that has ever been at man's disposal before, and when I think"
1047,"of what a little straggling, incidental, undisciplined and uncoordinated"
1047,"minority of inventors, experimenters, educators, writers and organisers"
1047,"has achieved this development of human possibilities, achieved it in"
1047,"spite of the disregard and aimlessness of the huge majority, and the"
1047,"passionate resistance of the active dull, my imagination grows giddy"
1047,"with dazzling intimations of the human splendours the justly organised"
1047,"state may yet attain. I glimpse for a bewildering instant the heights"
1047,"that may be scaled, the splendid enterprises made possible."
1047,""
1047,"But the appeal goes out now in other forms, in a book that catches at"
1047,"thousands of readers for the eye of a Prince diffused. It is the"
1047,"old appeal indeed for the unification of human effort, the ending of"
1047,"confusions, but instead of the Machiavellian deference to a flattered"
1047,"lord, a man cries out of his heart to the unseen fellowship about him."
1047,"The last written dedication of all those I burnt last night, was to no"
1047,"single man, but to the socially constructive passion--in any man...."
1047,""
1047,"There is, moreover, a second great difference in kind between my world"
1047,"and Machiavelli's. We are discovering women. It is as if they had come"
1047,"across a vast interval since his time, into the very chamber of the"
1047,"statesman."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,"In Machiavelli's outlook the interest of womanhood was in a region of"
1047,"life almost infinitely remote from his statecraft. They were the vehicle"
1047,"of children, but only Imperial Rome and the new world of to-day have"
1047,"ever had an inkling of the significance that might give them in the"
1047,"state. They did their work, he thought, as the ploughed earth bears its"
1047,"crops. Apart from their function of fertility they gave a humorous twist"
1047,"to life, stimulated worthy men to toil, and wasted the hours of Princes."
1047,"He left the thought of women outside with his other dusty things when"
1047,"he went into his study to write, dismissed them from his mind. But"
1047,"our modern world is burthened with its sense of the immense, now half"
1047,"articulate, significance of women. They stand now, as it were, close"
1047,"beside the silver candlesticks, speaking as Machiavelli writes, until he"
1047,"stays his pen and turns to discuss his writing with them."
1047,""
1047,"It is this gradual discovery of sex as a thing collectively portentous"
1047,"that I have to mingle with my statecraft if my picture is to be true"
1047,"which has turned me at length from a treatise to the telling of my own"
1047,"story. In my life I have paralleled very closely the slow realisations"
1047,"that are going on in the world about me. I began life ignoring women,"
1047,"they came to me at first perplexing and dishonouring; only very slowly"
1047,"and very late in my life and after misadventure, did I gauge the power"
1047,"and beauty of the love of man and woman and learnt how it must needs"
1047,"frame a justifiable vision of the ordered world. Love has brought me"
1047,"to disaster, because my career had been planned regardless of its"
1047,"possibility and value. But Machiavelli, it seems to me, when he"
1047,"went into his study, left not only the earth of life outside but its"
1047,"unsuspected soul."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"3"
1047,""
1047,"Like Machiavelli at San Casciano, if I may take this analogy one step"
1047,"further, I too am an exile. Office and leading are closed to me. The"
1047,"political career that promised so much for me is shattered and ended for"
1047,"ever."
1047,""
1047,"I look out from this vine-wreathed veranda under the branches of a stone"
1047,"pine; I see wide and far across a purple valley whose sides are terraced"
1047,"and set with houses of pine and ivory, the Gulf of Liguria gleaming"
1047,"sapphire blue, and cloud-like baseless mountains hanging in the sky, and"
1047,"I think of lank and coaly steamships heaving on the grey rollers of the"
1047,"English Channel and darkling streets wet with rain, I recall as if I"
1047,"were back there the busy exit from Charing Cross, the cross and the"
1047,"money-changers' offices, the splendid grime of giant London and the"
1047,"crowds going perpetually to and fro, the lights by night and the urgency"
1047,"and eventfulness of that great rain-swept heart of the modern world."
1047,""
1047,"It is difficult to think we have left that--for many years if not for"
1047,"ever. In thought I walk once more in Palace Yard and hear the clink and"
1047,"clatter of hansoms and the quick quiet whirr of motors; I go in vivid"
1047,"recent memories through the stir in the lobbies, I sit again at eventful"
1047,"dinners in those old dining-rooms like cellars below the House--dinners"
1047,"that ended with shrill division bells, I think of huge clubs swarming"
1047,"and excited by the bulletins of that electoral battle that was for me"
1047,"the opening opportunity. I see the stencilled names and numbers go up on"
1047,"the green baize, constituency after constituency, amidst murmurs or loud"
1047,"shouting...."
1047,""
1047,"It is over for me now and vanished. That opportunity will come no more."
1047,"Very probably you have heard already some crude inaccurate version of"
1047,"our story and why I did not take office, and have formed your partial"
1047,"judgement on me. And so it is I sit now at my stone table, half out of"
1047,"life already, in a warm, large, shadowy leisure, splashed with sunlight"
1047,"and hung with vine tendrils, with paper before me to distil such wisdom"
1047,"as I can, as Machiavelli in his exile sought to do, from the things I"
1047,"have learnt and felt during the career that has ended now in my divorce."
1047,""
1047,"I climbed high and fast from small beginnings. I had the mind of my"
1047,"party. I do not know where I might not have ended, but for this red"
1047,"blaze that came out of my unguarded nature and closed my career for"
1047,"ever."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"CHAPTER THE SECOND ~~ BROMSTEAD AND MY FATHER"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,"I dreamt first of states and cities and political things when I was a"
1047,"little boy in knickerbockers."
1047,""
1047,"When I think of how such things began in my mind, there comes back to me"
1047,"the memory of an enormous bleak room with its ceiling going up to heaven"
1047,"and its floor covered irregularly with patched and defective oilcloth"
1047,"and a dingy mat or so and a ""surround"" as they call it, of dark stained"
1047,"wood. Here and there against the wall are trunks and boxes. There are"
1047,"cupboards on either side of the fireplace and bookshelves with"
1047,"books above them, and on the wall and rather tattered is a large"
1047,"yellow-varnished geological map of the South of England. Over the mantel"
1047,"is a huge lump of white coral rock and several big fossil bones, and"
1047,"above that hangs the portrait of a brainy gentleman, sliced in half and"
1047,"displaying an interior of intricate detail and much vigour of coloring."
1047,"It is the floor I think of chiefly; over the oilcloth of which, assumed"
1047,"to be land, spread towns and villages and forts of wooden bricks; there"
1047,"are steep square hills (geologically, volumes of Orr's CYCLOPAEDIA OF"
1047,"THE SCIENCES) and the cracks and spaces of the floor and the bare brown"
1047,"surround were the water channels and open sea of that continent of mine."
1047,""
1047,"I still remember with infinite gratitude the great-uncle to whom I"
1047,"owe my bricks. He must have been one of those rare adults who have not"
1047,"forgotten the chagrins and dreams of childhood. He was a prosperous west"
1047,"of England builder; including my father he had three nephews, and for"
1047,"each of them he caused a box of bricks to be made by an out-of-work"
1047,"carpenter, not the insufficient supply of the toyshop, you understand,"
1047,"but a really adequate quantity of bricks made out of oak and shaped"
1047,"and smoothed, bricks about five inches by two and a half by one, and"
1047,"half-bricks and quarter-bricks to correspond. There were hundreds of"
1047,"them, many hundreds. I could build six towers as high as myself with"
1047,"them, and there seemed quite enough for every engineering project I"
1047,"could undertake. I could build whole towns with streets and houses and"
1047,"churches and citadels; I could bridge every gap in the oilcloth and make"
1047,"causeways over crumpled spaces (which I feigned to be morasses), and on"
1047,"a keel of whole bricks it was possible to construct ships to push"
1047,"over the high seas to the remotest port in the room. And a disciplined"
1047,"population, that rose at last by sedulous begging on birthdays and"
1047,"all convenient occasions to well over two hundred, of lead sailors and"
1047,"soldiers, horse, foot and artillery, inhabited this world."
1047,""
1047,"Justice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who write"
1047,"about toys. The praises of the toy theatre have been a common theme for"
1047,"essayists, the planning of the scenes, the painting and cutting out of"
1047,"the caste, penny plain twopence coloured, the stink and glory of the"
1047,"performance and the final conflagration. I had such a theatre once, but"
1047,"I never loved it nor hoped for much from it; my bricks and soldiers were"
1047,"my perpetual drama. I recall an incessant variety of interests. There"
1047,"was the mystery and charm of the complicated buildings one could make,"
1047,"with long passages and steps and windows through which one peeped into"
1047,"their intricacies, and by means of slips of card one could make slanting"
1047,"ways in them, and send marbles rolling from top to base and thence out"
1047,"into the hold of a waiting ship. Then there were the fortresses and gun"
1047,"emplacements and covered ways in which one's soldiers went. And there"
1047,"was commerce; the shops and markets and store-rooms full of nasturtium"
1047,"seed, thrift seed, lupin beans and suchlike provender from the garden;"
1047,"such stuff one stored in match-boxes and pill-boxes, or packed in sacks"
1047,"of old glove fingers tied up with thread and sent off by waggons along"
1047,"the great military road to the beleaguered fortress on the Indian"
1047,"frontier beyond the worn places that were dismal swamps. And there were"
1047,"battles on the way."
1047,""
1047,"That great road is still clear in my memory. I was given, I forget by"
1047,"what benefactor, certain particularly fierce red Indians of lead--I have"
1047,"never seen such soldiers since--and for these my father helped me to"
1047,"make tepees of brown paper, and I settled them in a hitherto desolate"
1047,"country under the frowning nail-studded cliffs of an ancient trunk. Then"
1047,"I conquered them and garrisoned their land. (Alas! they died, no doubt"
1047,"through contact with civilisation--one my mother trod on--and their"
1047,"land became a wilderness again and was ravaged for a time by a clockwork"
1047,"crocodile of vast proportions.) And out towards the coal-scuttle was a"
1047,"region near the impassable thickets of the ragged hearthrug where lived"
1047,"certain china Zulus brandishing spears, and a mountain country of"
1047,"rudely piled bricks concealing the most devious and enchanting caves and"
1047,"several mines of gold and silver paper. Among these rocks a number of"
1047,"survivors from a Noah's Ark made a various, dangerous, albeit frequently"
1047,"invalid and crippled fauna, and I was wont to increase the uncultivated"
1047,"wildness of this region further by trees of privet-twigs from the garden"
1047,"hedge and box from the garden borders. By these territories went"
1047,"my Imperial Road carrying produce to and fro, bridging gaps in the"
1047,"oilcloth, tunnelling through Encyclopaedic hills--one tunnel was three"
1047,"volumes long--defended as occasion required by camps of paper tents"
1047,"or brick blockhouses, and ending at last in a magnificently engineered"
1047,"ascent to a fortress on the cliffs commanding the Indian reservation."
1047,""
1047,"My games upon the floor must have spread over several years and"
1047,"developed from small beginnings, incorporating now this suggestion and"
1047,"now that. They stretch, I suppose, from seven to eleven or twelve. I"
1047,"played them intermittently, and they bulk now in the retrospect far more"
1047,"significantly than they did at the time. I played them in bursts, and"
1047,"then forgot them for long periods; through the spring and summer I was"
1047,"mostly out of doors, and school and classes caught me early. And in"
1047,"the retrospect I see them all not only magnified and transfigured, but"
1047,"fore-shortened and confused together. A clockwork railway, I seem to"
1047,"remember, came and went; one or two clockwork boats, toy sailing ships"
1047,"that, being keeled, would do nothing but lie on their beam ends on the"
1047,"floor; a detestable lot of cavalrymen, undersized and gilt all over,"
1047,"given me by a maiden aunt, and very much what one might expect from"
1047,"an aunt, that I used as Nero used his Christians to ornament my public"
1047,"buildings; and I finally melted some into fratricidal bullets, and"
1047,"therewith blew the rest to flat splashes of lead by means of a brass"
1047,"cannon in the garden."
1047,""
1047,"I find this empire of the floor much more vivid and detailed in my"
1047,"memory now than many of the owners of the skirts and legs and boots that"
1047,"went gingerly across its territories. Occasionally, alas! they stooped"
1047,"to scrub, abolishing in one universal destruction the slow growth of"
1047,"whole days of civilised development. I still remember the hatred and"
1047,"disgust of these catastrophes. Like Noah I was given warnings. Did I"
1047,"disregard them, coarse red hands would descend, plucking garrisons"
1047,"from fortresses and sailors from ships, jumbling them up in their wrong"
1047,"boxes, clumsily so that their rifles and swords were broken, sweeping"
1047,"the splendid curves of the Imperial Road into heaps of ruins, casting"
1047,"the jungle growth of Zululand into the fire."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, Master Dick,"" the voice of this cosmic calamity would say, ""you"
1047,"ought to have put them away last night. No! I can't wait until you've"
1047,"sailed them all away in ships. I got my work to do, and do it I will."""
1047,""
1047,"And in no time all my continents and lands were swirling water and"
1047,"swiping strokes of house-flannel."
1047,""
1047,"That was the worst of my giant visitants, but my mother too, dear lady,"
1047,"was something of a terror to this microcosm. She wore spring-sided"
1047,"boots, a kind of boot now vanished, I believe, from the world, with dull"
1047,"bodies and shiny toes, and a silk dress with flounces that were very"
1047,"destructive to the more hazardous viaducts of the Imperial Road. She"
1047,"was always, I seem to remember, fetching me; fetching me for a meal,"
1047,"fetching me for a walk or, detestable absurdity! fetching me for a wash"
1047,"and brush up, and she never seemed to understand anything whatever of"
1047,"the political Systems across which she came to me. Also she forbade all"
1047,"toys on Sundays except the bricks for church-building and the soldiers"
1047,"for church parade, or a Scriptural use of the remains of the Noah's Ark"
1047,"mixed up with a wooden Swiss dairy farm. But she really did not know"
1047,"whether a thing was a church or not unless it positively bristled with"
1047,"cannon, and many a Sunday afternoon have I played Chicago (with the fear"
1047,"of God in my heart) under an infidel pretence that it was a new sort of"
1047,"ark rather elaborately done."
1047,""
1047,"Chicago, I must explain, was based upon my father's description of the"
1047,"pig slaughterings in that city and certain pictures I had seen. You made"
1047,"your beasts--which were all the ark lot really, provisionally conceived"
1047,"as pigs--go up elaborate approaches to a central pen, from which"
1047,"they went down a cardboard slide four at a time, and dropped most"
1047,"satisfyingly down a brick shaft, and pitter-litter over some steep steps"
1047,"to where a head slaughterman (ne Noah) strung a cotton loop round their"
1047,"legs and sent them by pin hooks along a wire to a second slaughterman"
1047,"with a chipped foot (formerly Mrs. Noah) who, if I remember rightly,"
1047,"converted them into Army sausage by means of a portion of the inside of"
1047,"an old alarum clock."
1047,""
1047,"My mother did not understand my games, but my father did. He wore"
1047,"bright-coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors--my mother"
1047,"disliked boots in the house--and he would sit down on my little chair"
1047,"and survey the microcosm on the floor with admirable understanding and"
1047,"sympathy."
1047,""
1047,"It was he who gave me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most"
1047,"of my ideas. ""Here's some corrugated iron,"" he would say, ""suitable for"
1047,"roofs and fencing,"" and hand me a lump of that stiff crinkled paper that"
1047,"is used for packing medicine bottles. Or, ""Dick, do you see the tiger"
1047,"loose near the Imperial Road?--won't do for your cattle ranch."" And I"
1047,"would find a bright new lead tiger like a special creation at large in"
1047,"the world, and demanding a hunting expedition and much elaborate effort"
1047,"to get him safely housed in the city menagerie beside the captured"
1047,"dragon crocodile, tamed now, and his key lost and the heart and spring"
1047,"gone out of him."
1047,""
1047,"And to the various irregular reading of my father I owe the inestimable"
1047,"blessing of never having a boy's book in my boyhood except those of"
1047,"Jules Verne. But my father used to get books for himself and me from"
1047,"the Bromstead Institute, Fenimore Cooper and Mayne Reid and illustrated"
1047,"histories; one of the Russo-Turkish war and one of Napier's expedition"
1047,"to Abyssinia I read from end to end; Stanley and Livingstone, lives"
1047,"of Wellington, Napoleon and Garibaldi, and back volumes of PUNCH, from"
1047,"which I derived conceptions of foreign and domestic politics it has"
1047,"taken years of adult reflection to correct. And at home permanently we"
1047,"had Wood's NATURAL HISTORY, a brand-new illustrated Green's HISTORY OF"
1047,"THE ENGLISH PEOPLE, Irving's COMPANIONS OF COLUMBUS, a great number"
1047,"of unbound parts of some geographical work, a VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD I"
1047,"think it was called, with pictures of foreign places, and Clarke's NEW"
1047,"TESTAMENT with a map of Palestine, and a variety of other informing"
1047,"books bought at sales. There was a Sowerby's BOTANY also, with thousands"
1047,"of carefully tinted pictures of British plants, and one or two other"
1047,"important works in the sitting-room. I was allowed to turn these over"
1047,"and even lie on the floor with them on Sundays and other occasions of"
1047,"exceptional cleanliness."
1047,""
1047,"And in the attic I found one day a very old forgotten map after the"
1047,"fashion of a bird's-eye view, representing the Crimea, that fascinated"
1047,"me and kept me for hours navigating its waters with a pin."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,"My father was a lank-limbed man in easy shabby tweed clothes and with"
1047,"his hands in his trouser pockets. He was a science teacher, taking"
1047,"a number of classes at the Bromstead Institute in Kent under the old"
1047,"Science and Art Department, and ""visiting"" various schools; and our"
1047,"resources were eked out by my mother's income of nearly a hundred"
1047,"pounds a year, and by his inheritance of a terrace of three palatial but"
1047,"structurally unsound stucco houses near Bromstead Station."
1047,""
1047,"They were big clumsy residences in the earliest Victorian style,"
1047,"interminably high and with deep damp basements and downstairs"
1047,"coal-cellars and kitchens that suggested an architect vindictively"
1047,"devoted to the discomfort of the servant class. If so, he had"
1047,"overreached himself and defeated his end, for no servant would stay"
1047,"in them unless for exceptional wages or exceptional tolerance of"
1047,"inefficiency or exceptional freedom in repartee. Every storey in the"
1047,"house was from twelve to fifteen feet high (which would have been cool"
1047,"and pleasant in a hot climate), and the stairs went steeply up, to end"
1047,"at last in attics too inaccessible for occupation. The ceilings had vast"
1047,"plaster cornices of classical design, fragments of which would sometimes"
1047,"fall unexpectedly, and the wall-papers were bold and gigantic in pattern"
1047,"and much variegated by damp and ill-mended rents."
1047,""
1047,"As my father was quite unable to let more than one of these houses at a"
1047,"time, and that for the most part to eccentric and undesirable tenants,"
1047,"he thought it politic to live in one of the two others, and devote the"
1047,"rent he received from the let one, when it was let, to the incessant"
1047,"necessary repairing of all three. He also did some of the repairing"
1047,"himself and, smoking a bull-dog pipe the while, which my mother would"
1047,"not allow him to do in the house, he cultivated vegetables in a sketchy,"
1047,"unpunctual and not always successful manner in the unoccupied gardens."
1047,"The three houses faced north, and the back of the one we occupied was"
1047,"covered by a grape-vine that yielded, I remember, small green grapes"
1047,"for pies in the spring, and imperfectly ripe black grapes in favourable"
1047,"autumns for the purposes of dessert. The grape-vine played an important"
1047,"part in my life, for my father broke his neck while he was pruning it,"
1047,"when I was thirteen."
1047,""
1047,"My father was what is called a man of ideas, but they were not always"
1047,"good ideas. My grandfather had been a private schoolmaster and one of"
1047,"the founders of the College of Preceptors, and my father had assisted"
1047,"him in his school until increasing competition and diminishing"
1047,"attendance had made it evident that the days of small private schools"
1047,"kept by unqualified persons were numbered. Thereupon my father had"
1047,"roused himself and had qualified as a science teacher under the Science"
1047,"and Art Department, which in these days had charge of the scientific and"
1047,"artistic education of the mass of the English population, and had thrown"
1047,"himself into science teaching and the earning of government grants"
1047,"therefor with great if transitory zeal and success."
1047,""
1047,"I do not remember anything of my father's earlier and more energetic"
1047,"time. I was the child of my parents' middle years; they married when my"
1047,"father was thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I saw only the last"
1047,"decadent phase of his educational career."
1047,""
1047,"The Science and Art Department has vanished altogether from the"
1047,"world, and people are forgetting it now with the utmost readiness and"
1047,"generosity. Part of its substance and staff and spirit survive, more or"
1047,"less completely digested into the Board of Education."
1047,""
1047,"The world does move on, even in its government. It is wonderful how many"
1047,"of the clumsy and limited governing bodies of my youth and early manhood"
1047,"have given place now to more scientific and efficient machinery. When"
1047,"I was a boy, Bromstead, which is now a borough, was ruled by a strange"
1047,"body called a Local Board--it was the Age of Boards--and I still"
1047,"remember indistinctly my father rejoicing at the breakfast-table over"
1047,"the liberation of London from the corrupt and devastating control of a"
1047,"Metropolitan Board of Works. Then there were also School Boards; I"
1047,"was already practically in politics before the London School Board was"
1047,"absorbed by the spreading tentacles of the London County Council."
1047,""
1047,"It gives a measure of the newness of our modern ideas of the State to"
1047,"remember that the very beginnings of public education lie within my"
1047,"father's lifetime, and that many most intelligent and patriotic people"
1047,"were shocked beyond measure at the State doing anything of the sort."
1047,"When he was born, totally illiterate people who could neither read a"
1047,"book nor write more than perhaps a clumsy signature, were to be found"
1047,"everywhere in England; and great masses of the population were getting"
1047,"no instruction at all. Only a few schools flourished upon the patronage"
1047,"of exceptional parents; all over the country the old endowed grammar"
1047,"schools were to be found sinking and dwindling; many of them had"
1047,"closed altogether. In the new great centres of population multitudes of"
1047,"children were sweated in the factories, darkly ignorant and wretched"
1047,"and the under-equipped and under-staffed National and British schools,"
1047,"supported by voluntary contributions and sectarian rivalries, made an"
1047,"ineffectual fight against this festering darkness. It was a condition"
1047,"of affairs clamouring for remedies, but there was an immense amount"
1047,"of indifference and prejudice to be overcome before any remedies were"
1047,"possible. Perhaps some day some industrious and lucid historian"
1047,"will disentangle all the muddle of impulses and antagonisms, the"
1047,"commercialism, utilitarianism, obstinate conservatism, humanitarian"
1047,"enthusiasm, out of which our present educational organisation arose."
1047,"I have long since come to believe it necessary that all new social"
1047,"institutions should be born in confusion, and that at first they should"
1047,"present chiefly crude and ridiculous aspects. The distrust of government"
1047,"in the Victorian days was far too great, and the general intelligence"
1047,"far too low, to permit the State to go about the new business it was"
1047,"taking up in a businesslike way, to train teachers, build and equip"
1047,"schools, endow pedagogic research, and provide properly written"
1047,"school-books. These things it was felt MUST be provided by individual"
1047,"and local effort, and since it was manifest that it was individual"
1047,"and local effort that were in default, it was reluctantly agreed to"
1047,"stimulate them by money payments. The State set up a machinery of"
1047,"examination both in Science and Art and for the elementary schools; and"
1047,"payments, known technically as grants, were made in accordance with the"
1047,"examination results attained, to such schools as Providence might see"
1047,"fit to send into the world. In this way it was felt the Demand would"
1047,"be established that would, according to the beliefs of that time,"
1047,"inevitably ensure the Supply. An industry of ""Grant earning"" was"
1047,"created, and this would give education as a necessary by-product."
1047,""
1047,"In the end this belief was found to need qualification, but"
1047,"Grant-earning was still in full activity when I was a small boy. So far"
1047,"as the Science and Art Department and my father are concerned, the task"
1047,"of examination was entrusted to eminent scientific men, for the most"
1047,"part quite unaccustomed to teaching. You see, if they also were teaching"
1047,"similar classes to those they examined, it was feared that injustice"
1047,"might be done. Year after year these eminent persons set questions"
1047,"and employed subordinates to read and mark the increasing thousands of"
1047,"answers that ensued, and having no doubt the national ideal of fairness"
1047,"well developed in their minds, they were careful each year to re-read"
1047,"the preceding papers before composing the current one, in order to see"
1047,"what it was usual to ask. As a result of this, in the course of a"
1047,"few years the recurrence and permutation of questions became almost"
1047,"calculable, and since the practical object of the teaching was to teach"
1047,"people not science, but how to write answers to these questions, the"
1047,"industry of Grant-earning assumed a form easily distinguished from any"
1047,"kind of genuine education whatever."
1047,""
1047,"Other remarkable compromises had also to be made with the spirit of the"
1047,"age. The unfortunate conflict between Religion and Science prevalent at"
1047,"this time was mitigated, if I remember rightly, by making graduates in"
1047,"arts and priests in the established church Science Teachers EX OFFICIO,"
1047,"and leaving local and private enterprise to provide schools, diagrams,"
1047,"books, material, according to the conceptions of efficiency prevalent in"
1047,"the district. Private enterprise made a particularly good thing of the"
1047,"books. A number of competing firms of publishers sprang into existence"
1047,"specialising in Science and Art Department work; they set themselves to"
1047,"produce text-books that should supply exactly the quantity and quality"
1047,"of knowledge necessary for every stage of each of five and twenty"
1047,"subjects into which desirable science was divided, and copies and models"
1047,"and instructions that should give precisely the method and gestures"
1047,"esteemed as proficiency in art. Every section of each book was written"
1047,"in the idiom found to be most satisfactory to the examiners, and test"
1047,"questions extracted from papers set in former years were appended to"
1047,"every chapter. By means of these last the teacher was able to train his"
1047,"class to the very highest level of grant-earning efficiency, and very"
1047,"naturally he cast all other methods of exposition aside. First he posed"
1047,"his pupils with questions and then dictated model replies."
1047,""
1047,"That was my father's method of instruction. I attended his classes as an"
1047,"elementary grant-earner from the age of ten until his death, and it is"
1047,"so I remember him, sitting on the edge of a table, smothering a yawn"
1047,"occasionally and giving out the infallible formulae to the industriously"
1047,"scribbling class sitting in rows of desks before him. Occasionally he"
1047,"would slide to his feet and go to a blackboard on an easel and draw on"
1047,"that very slowly and deliberately in coloured chalks a diagram for the"
1047,"class to copy in coloured pencils, and sometimes he would display a"
1047,"specimen or arrange an experiment for them to see. The room in the"
1047,"Institute in which he taught was equipped with a certain amount of"
1047,"apparatus prescribed as necessary for subject this and subject that by"
1047,"the Science and Art Department, and this my father would supplement with"
1047,"maps and diagrams and drawings of his own."
1047,""
1047,"But he never really did experiments, except that in the class in"
1047,"systematic botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to pieces."
1047,"He did not do experiments if he could possibly help it, because in the"
1047,"first place they used up time and gas for the Bunsen burner and good"
1047,"material in a ruinous fashion, and in the second they were, in his"
1047,"rather careless and sketchy hands, apt to endanger the apparatus of"
1047,"the Institute and even the lives of his students. Then thirdly, real"
1047,"experiments involved washing up. And moreover they always turned out"
1047,"wrong, and sometimes misled the too observant learner very seriously"
1047,"and opened demoralising controversies. Quite early in life I acquired an"
1047,"almost ineradicable sense of the unscientific perversity of Nature and"
1047,"the impassable gulf that is fixed between systematic science and elusive"
1047,"fact. I knew, for example, that in science, whether it be subject XII.,"
1047,"Organic Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when you blow"
1047,"into a glass of lime-water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you"
1047,"continue to blow it clears again, whereas in truth you may blow into the"
1047,"stuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face and"
1047,"painful under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all. And I knew,"
1047,"too, that in science if you put potassium chlorate into a retort and"
1047,"heat it over a Bunsen burner, oxygen is disengaged and may be collected"
1047,"over water, whereas in real life if you do anything of the sort the"
1047,"vessel cracks with a loud report, the potassium chlorate descends"
1047,"sizzling upon the flame, the experimenter says ""Oh! Damn!"" with"
1047,"astonishing heartiness and distinctness, and a lady student in the back"
1047,"seats gets up and leaves the room."
1047,""
1047,"Science is the organised conquest of Nature, and I can quite understand"
1047,"that ancient libertine refusing to co-operate in her own undoing. And I"
1047,"can quite understand, too, my father's preference for what he called"
1047,"an illustrative experiment, which was simply an arrangement of the"
1047,"apparatus in front of the class with nothing whatever by way of"
1047,"material, and the Bunsen burner clean and cool, and then a slow luminous"
1047,"description of just what you did put in it when you were so ill-advised"
1047,"as to carry the affair beyond illustration, and just exactly what ought"
1047,"anyhow to happen when you did. He had considerable powers of vivid"
1047,"expression, so that in this way he could make us see all he described."
1047,"The class, freed from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this"
1047,"still life without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw,"
1047,"then my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard"
1047,"to be copied instead. And he would also write on the blackboard any"
1047,"exceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as ""empyreumatic"""
1047,"or ""botryoidal."""
1047,""
1047,"Some words in constant use he rarely explained. I remember once sticking"
1047,"up my hand and asking him in the full flow of description, ""Please, sir,"
1047,"what is flocculent?"""
1047,""
1047,"""The precipitate is."""
1047,""
1047,"""Yes, sir, but what does it mean?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Oh! flocculent!"" said my father, ""flocculent! Why--"" he extended his"
1047,"hand and arm and twiddled his fingers for a second in the air. ""Like"
1047,"that,"" he said."
1047,""
1047,"I thought the explanation sufficient, but he paused for a moment after"
1047,"giving it. ""As in a flock bed, you know,"" he added and resumed his"
1047,"discourse."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"3"
1047,""
1047,"My father, I am afraid, carried a natural incompetence in practical"
1047,"affairs to an exceptionally high level. He combined practical"
1047,"incompetence, practical enterprise and a thoroughly sanguine"
1047,"temperament, in a manner that I have never seen paralleled in any human"
1047,"being. He was always trying to do new things in the briskest manner,"
1047,"under the suggestion of books or papers or his own spontaneous"
1047,"imagination, and as he had never been trained to do anything whatever"
1047,"in his life properly, his futilities were extensive and thorough. At one"
1047,"time he nearly gave up his classes for intensive culture, so enamoured"
1047,"was he of its possibilities; the peculiar pungency of the manure he got,"
1047,"in pursuit of a chemical theory of his own, has scarred my olfactory"
1047,"memories for a lifetime. The intensive culture phase is very clear in my"
1047,"memory; it came near the end of his career and when I was between eleven"
1047,"and twelve. I was mobilised to gather caterpillars on several occasions,"
1047,"and assisted in nocturnal raids upon the slugs by lantern-light that"
1047,"wrecked my preparation work for school next day. My father dug up both"
1047,"lawns, and trenched and manured in spasms of immense vigour alternating"
1047,"with periods of paralysing distaste for the garden. And for weeks he"
1047,"talked about eight hundred pounds an acre at every meal."
1047,""
1047,"A garden, even when it is not exasperated by intensive methods, is a"
1047,"thing as exacting as a baby, its moods have to be watched; it does"
1047,"not wait upon the cultivator's convenience, but has times of its own."
1047,"Intensive culture greatly increases this disposition to trouble mankind;"
1047,"it makes a garden touchy and hysterical, a drugged and demoralised and"
1047,"over-irritated garden. My father got at cross purposes with our two"
1047,"patches at an early stage. Everything grew wrong from the first to last,"
1047,"and if my father's manures intensified nothing else, they certainly"
1047,"intensified the Primordial Curse. The peas were eaten in the night"
1047,"before they were three inches high, the beans bore nothing but blight,"
1047,"the only apparent result of a spraying of the potatoes was to develop"
1047,"a PENCHANT in the cat for being ill indoors, the cucumber frames were"
1047,"damaged by the catapulting of boys going down the lane at the back,"
1047,"and all your cucumbers were mysteriously embittered. That lane with its"
1047,"occasional passers-by did much to wreck the intensive scheme, because my"
1047,"father always stopped work and went indoors if any one watched him."
1047,"His special manure was apt to arouse a troublesome spirit of inquiry in"
1047,"hardy natures."
1047,""
1047,"In digging his rows and shaping his patches he neglected the guiding"
1047,"string and trusted to his eye altogether too much, and the consequent"
1047,"obliquity and the various wind-breaks and scare-crows he erected, and"
1047,"particularly an irrigation contrivance he began and never finished by"
1047,"which everything was to be watered at once by means of pieces of gutter"
1047,"from the roof and outhouses of Number 2, and a large and particularly"
1047,"obstinate clump of elder-bushes in the abolished hedge that he had"
1047,"failed to destroy entirely either by axe or by fire, combined to give"
1047,"the gardens under intensive culture a singularly desolate and disorderly"
1047,"appearance. He took steps towards the diversion of our house drain under"
1047,"the influence of the Sewage Utilisation Society; but happily he stopped"
1047,"in time. He hardly completed any of the operations he began; something"
1047,"else became more urgent or simply he tired; a considerable area of the"
1047,"Number 2 territory was never even dug up."

1047,"In the end the affair irritated him beyond endurance. Never was a man"
1047,"less horticulturally-minded. The clamour of these vegetables he had"
1047,"launched into the world for his service and assistance, wore out his"
1047,"patience. He would walk into the garden the happiest of men after a"
1047,"day or so of disregard, talking to me of history perhaps or social"
1047,"organisation, or summarising some book he had read. He talked to me"
1047,"of anything that interested him, regardless of my limitations. Then he"
1047,"would begin to note the growth of the weeds. ""This won't do,"" he would"
1047,"say and pull up a handful."
1047,""
1047,"More weeding would follow and the talk would become fragmentary. His"
1047,"hands would become earthy, his nails black, weeds would snap off in"
1047,"his careless grip, leaving the roots behind. The world would darken."
1047,"He would look at his fingers with disgusted astonishment. ""CURSE these"
1047,"weeds!"" he would say from his heart. His discourse was at an end."
1047,""
1047,"I have memories, too, of his sudden unexpected charges into the"
1047,"tranquillity of the house, his hands and clothes intensively enriched."
1047,"He would come in like a whirlwind. ""This damned stuff all over me and"
1047,"the Agricultural Chemistry Class at six! Bah! AAAAAAH!"""
1047,""
1047,"My mother would never learn not to attempt to break him of swearing"
1047,"on such occasions. She would remain standing a little stiffly in the"
1047,"scullery refusing to assist him to the adjectival towel he sought."
1047,""
1047,"""If you say such things--"""
1047,""
1047,"He would dance with rage and hurl the soap about. ""The towel!"" he would"
1047,"cry, flicking suds from big fingers in every direction; ""the towel! I'll"
1047,"let the blithering class slide if you don't give me the towel! I'll give"
1047,"up everything, I tell you--everything!""..."
1047,""
1047,"At last with the failure of the lettuces came the breaking point. I was"
1047,"in the little arbour learning Latin irregular verbs when it happened."
1047,"I can see him still, his peculiar tenor voice still echoes in my brain,"
1047,"shouting his opinion of intensive culture for all the world to hear, and"
1047,"slashing away at that abominable mockery of a crop with a hoe. We had"
1047,"tied them up with bast only a week or so before, and now half were"
1047,"rotten and half had shot up into tall slender growths. He had the hoe in"
1047,"both hands and slogged. Great wipes he made, and at each stroke he said,"
1047,"""Take that!"""
1047,""
1047,"The air was thick with flying fragments of abortive salad. It was a"
1047,"fantastic massacre. It was the French Revolution of that cold tyranny,"
1047,"the vindictive overthrow of the pampered vegetable aristocrats. After he"
1047,"had assuaged his passion upon them, he turned for other prey; he kicked"
1047,"holes in two of our noblest marrows, flicked off the heads of half a row"
1047,"of artichokes, and shied the hoe with a splendid smash into the cucumber"
1047,"frame. Something of the awe of that moment returns to me as I write of"
1047,"it."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, my boy,"" he said, approaching with an expression of beneficent"
1047,"happiness, ""I've done with gardening. Let's go for a walk like"
1047,"reasonable beings. I've had enough of this""--his face was convulsed for"

1047,"That afternoon's walk sticks in my memory for many reasons. One is"
1047,"that we went further than I had ever been before; far beyond Keston and"
1047,"nearly to Seven-oaks, coming back by train from Dunton Green, and the"
1047,"other is that my father as he went along talked about himself, not so"
1047,"much to me as to himself, and about life and what he had done with"
1047,"it. He monologued so that at times he produced an effect of weird"
1047,"world-forgetfulness. I listened puzzled, and at that time not"
1047,"understanding many things that afterwards became plain to me. It is only"
1047,"in recent years that I have discovered the pathos of that monologue; how"
1047,"friendless my father was and uncompanioned in his thoughts and feelings,"
1047,"and what a hunger he may have felt for the sympathy of the undeveloped"
1047,"youngster who trotted by his side."

1047,"""I'm no gardener,"" he said, ""I'm no anything. Why the devil did I start"

1047,"Mucked about with life."" He suddenly addressed himself to me, and for"
1047,"an instant I started like an eavesdropper discovered. ""Whatever you do,"
1047,"boy, whatever you do, make a Plan. Make a good Plan and stick to it."

1047,"beware of Things! Before you know where you are you are waiting on them"
1047,"and minding them. They'll eat your life up. Eat up your hours and your"

1047,"So it was my father discoursed, if not in those particular words, yet"
1047,"exactly in that manner, as he slouched along the southward road, with"
1047,"resentful eyes becoming less resentful as he talked, and flinging out"
1047,"clumsy illustrative motions at the outskirts of Bromstead as we passed"
1047,"along them. That afternoon he hated Bromstead, from its foot-tiring"
1047,"pebbles up. He had no illusions about Bromstead or himself. I have"
1047,"the clearest impression of him in his garden-stained tweeds with a"
1047,"deer-stalker hat on the back of his head and presently a pipe sometimes"
1047,"between his teeth and sometimes in his gesticulating hand, as he became"
1047,"diverted by his talk from his original exasperation...."
1047,""
1047,"This particular afternoon is no doubt mixed up in my memory with"
1047,"many other afternoons; all sorts of things my father said and did at"
1047,"different times have got themselves referred to it; it filled me at the"
1047,"time with a great unprecedented sense of fellowship and it has become"
1047,"the symbol now for all our intercourse together. If I didn't understand"
1047,"the things he said, I did the mood he was in. He gave me two very broad"
1047,"ideas in that talk and the talks I have mingled with it; he gave them"
1047,"to me very clearly and they have remained fundamental in my mind; one a"
1047,"sense of the extraordinary confusion and waste and planlessness of the"
1047,"human life that went on all about us; and the other of a great ideal of"
1047,"order and economy which he called variously Science and Civilisation,"
1047,"and which, though I do not remember that he ever used that word, I"
1047,"suppose many people nowadays would identify with Socialism,--as the"
1047,"Fabians expound it."
1047,""
1047,"He was not very definite about this Science, you must understand, but"
1047,"he seemed always to be waving his hand towards it,--just as his"
1047,"contemporary Tennyson seems always to be doing--he belonged to his age"
1047,"and mostly his talk was destructive of the limited beliefs of his time,"
1047,"he led me to infer rather than actually told me that this Science was"
1047,"coming, a spirit of light and order, to the rescue of a world groaning"
1047,"and travailing in muddle for the want of it...."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"5"
1047,""
1047,"When I think of Bromstead nowadays I find it inseparably bound up"
1047,"with the disorders of my father's gardening, and the odd patchings and"
1047,"paintings that disfigured his houses. It was all of a piece with that."
1047,""
1047,"Let me try and give something of the quality of Bromstead and something"
1047,"of its history. It is the quality and history of a thousand places"
1047,"round and about London, and round and about the other great centres of"
1047,"population in the world. Indeed it is in a measure the quality of"
1047,"the whole of this modern world from which we who have the statesman's"
1047,"passion struggle to evolve, and dream still of evolving order."
1047,""
1047,"First, then, you must think of Bromstead a hundred and fifty years ago,"
1047,"as a narrow irregular little street of thatched houses strung out on"
1047,"the London and Dover Road, a little mellow sample unit of a social order"
1047,"that had a kind of completeness, at its level, of its own. At that"
1047,"time its population numbered a little under two thousand people, mostly"
1047,"engaged in agricultural work or in trades serving agriculture. There was"
1047,"a blacksmith, a saddler, a chemist, a doctor, a barber, a linen-draper"
1047,"(who brewed his own beer); a veterinary surgeon, a hardware shop,"
1047,"and two capacious inns. Round and about it were a number of pleasant"
1047,"gentlemen's seats, whose owners went frequently to London town in their"
1047,"coaches along the very tolerable high-road. The church was big enough"
1047,"to hold the whole population, were people minded to go to church, and"
1047,"indeed a large proportion did go, and all who married were married in"
1047,"it, and everybody, to begin with, was christened at its font and buried"
1047,"at last in its yew-shaded graveyard. Everybody knew everybody in the"
1047,"place. It was, in fact, a definite place and a real human community in"
1047,"those days. There was a pleasant old market-house in the middle of the"
1047,"town with a weekly market, and an annual fair at which much cheerful"
1047,"merry making and homely intoxication occurred; there was a pack of"
1047,"hounds which hunted within five miles of London Bridge, and the local"
1047,"gentry would occasionally enliven the place with valiant cricket matches"
1047,"for a hundred guineas a side, to the vast excitement of the entire"
1047,"population. It was very much the same sort of place that it had been for"
1047,"three or four centuries. A Bromstead Rip van Winkle from 1550 returning"
1047,"in 1750 would have found most of the old houses still as he had known"
1047,"them, the same trades a little improved and differentiated one from the"
1047,"other, the same roads rather more carefully tended, the Inns not very"
1047,"much altered, the ancient familiar market-house. The occasional wheeled"
1047,"traffic would have struck him as the most remarkable difference, next"
1047,"perhaps to the swaggering painted stone monuments instead of brasses"
1047,"and the protestant severity of the communion-table in the parish"
1047,"church,--both from the material point of view very little things. A"
1047,"Rip van Winkle from 1350, again, would have noticed scarcely greater"
1047,"changes; fewer clergy, more people, and particularly more people of"
1047,"the middling sort; the glass in the windows of many of the houses, the"
1047,"stylish chimneys springing up everywhere would have impressed him, and"
1047,"suchlike details. The place would have had the same boundaries, the same"
1047,"broad essential features, would have been still itself in the way that"
1047,"a man is still himself after he has ""filled out"" a little and grown a"
1047,"longer beard and changed his clothes."
1047,""
1047,"But after 1750 something got hold of the world, something that was"
1047,"destined to alter the scale of every human affair."
1047,""
1047,"That something was machinery and a vague energetic disposition to"
1047,"improve material things. In another part of England ingenious people"
1047,"were beginning to use coal in smelting iron, and were producing metal"
1047,"in abundance and metal castings in sizes that had hitherto been"
1047,"unattainable. Without warning or preparation, increment involving"
1047,"countless possibilities of further increment was coming to the strength"
1047,"of horses and men. ""Power,"" all unsuspected, was flowing like a drug"
1047,"into the veins of the social body."
1047,""
1047,"Nobody seems to have perceived this coming of power, and nobody had"
1047,"calculated its probable consequences. Suddenly, almost inadvertently,"
1047,"people found themselves doing things that would have amazed their"
1047,"ancestors. They began to construct wheeled vehicles much more easily and"
1047,"cheaply than they had ever done before, to make up roads and move things"
1047,"about that had formerly been esteemed too heavy for locomotion, to join"
1047,"woodwork with iron nails instead of wooden pegs, to achieve all sorts"
1047,"of mechanical possibilities, to trade more freely and manufacture on a"
1047,"larger scale, to send goods abroad in a wholesale and systematic way,"
1047,"to bring back commodities from overseas, not simply spices and fine"
1047,"commodities, but goods in bulk. The new influence spread to agriculture,"
1047,"iron appliances replaced wooden, breeding of stock became systematic,"
1047,"paper-making and printing increased and cheapened. Roofs of slate and"
1047,"tile appeared amidst and presently prevailed over the original Bromstead"
1047,"thatch, the huge space of Common to the south was extensively enclosed,"
1047,"and what had been an ill-defined horse-track to Dover, only passable"
1047,"by adventurous coaches in dry weather, became the Dover Road, and was"
1047,"presently the route first of one and then of several daily coaches."
1047,"The High Street was discovered to be too tortuous for these awakening"
1047,"energies, and a new road cut off its worst contortions. Residential"
1047,"villas appeared occupied by retired tradesmen and widows, who esteemed"
1047,"the place healthy, and by others of a strange new unoccupied class of"
1047,"people who had money invested in joint-stock enterprises. First one"
1047,"and then several boys' boarding-schools came, drawing their pupils from"
1047,"London,--my grandfather's was one of these. London, twelve miles to the"
1047,"north-west, was making itself felt more and more."
1047,""
1047,"But this was only the beginning of the growth period, the first trickle"
1047,"of the coming flood of mechanical power. Away in the north they were"
1047,"casting iron in bigger and bigger forms, working their way to the"
1047,"production of steel on a large scale, applying power in factories."
1047,"Bromstead had almost doubted in size again long before the railway came;"
1047,"there was hardly any thatch left in the High Street, but instead were"
1047,"houses with handsome brass-knockered front doors and several windows,"
1047,"and shops with shop-fronts all of square glass panes, and the place was"
1047,"lighted publicly now by oil lamps--previously only one flickering lamp"
1047,"outside each of the coaching inns had broken the nocturnal darkness."
1047,"And there was talk, it long remained talk,--of gas. The gasworks came in"
1047,"1834, and about that date my father's three houses must have been built"
1047,"convenient for the London Road. They mark nearly the beginning of the"
1047,"real suburban quality; they were let at first to City people still"
1047,"engaged in business."
1047,""
1047,"And then hard on the gasworks had come the railway and cheap coal; there"
1047,"was a wild outbreak of brickfields upon the claylands to the east, and"
1047,"the Great Growth had begun in earnest. The agricultural placidities that"
1047,"had formerly come to the very borders of the High Street were broken up"
1047,"north, west and south, by new roads. This enterprising person and then"
1047,"that began to ""run up"" houses, irrespective of every other enterprising"
1047,"person who was doing the same thing. A Local Board came into existence,"
1047,"and with much hesitation and penny-wise economy inaugurated drainage"
1047,"works. Rates became a common topic, a fact of accumulating importance."
1047,"Several chapels of zinc and iron appeared, and also a white new church"
1047,"in commercial Gothic upon the common, and another of red brick in the"
1047,"residential district out beyond the brickfields towards Chessington."
1047,""
1047,"The population doubled again and doubled again, and became particularly"
1047,"teeming in the prolific ""working-class"" district about the deep-rutted,"
1047,"muddy, coal-blackened roads between the gasworks, Blodgett's laundries,"
1047,"and the railway goods-yard. Weekly properties, that is to say small"
1047,"houses built by small property owners and let by the week, sprang up"
1047,"also in the Cage Fields, and presently extended right up the London"
1047,"Road. A single national school in an inconvenient situation set itself"
1047,"inadequately to collect subscriptions and teach the swarming, sniffing,"
1047,"grimy offspring of this dingy new population to read. The villages of"
1047,"Beckington, which used to be three miles to the west, and Blamely four"
1047,"miles to the east of Bromstead, were experiencing similar distensions"
1047,"and proliferations, and grew out to meet us. All effect of locality or"
1047,"community had gone from these places long before I was born; hardly any"
1047,"one knew any one; there was no general meeting place any more, the old"
1047,"fairs were just common nuisances haunted by gypsies, van showmen, Cheap"
1047,"Jacks and London roughs, the churches were incapable of a quarter of the"
1047,"population. One or two local papers of shameless veniality reported the"
1047,"proceedings of the local Bench and the local Board, compelled tradesmen"
1047,"who were interested in these affairs to advertise, used the epithet"
1047,"""Bromstedian"" as one expressing peculiar virtues, and so maintained in"
1047,"the general mind a weak tradition of some local quality that embraced"
1047,"us all. Then the parish graveyard filled up and became a scandal, and"
1047,"an ambitious area with an air of appetite was walled in by a Bromstead"
1047,"Cemetery Company, and planted with suitably high-minded and sorrowful"
1047,"varieties of conifer. A stonemason took one of the earlier villas with"
1047,"a front garden at the end of the High Street, and displayed a supply"
1047,"of urns on pillars and headstones and crosses in stone, marble, and"
1047,"granite, that would have sufficed to commemorate in elaborate detail the"
1047,"entire population of Bromstead as one found it in 1750."
1047,""
1047,"The cemetery was made when I was a little boy of five or six; I was in"
1047,"the full tide of building and growth from the first; the second railway"
1047,"with its station at Bromstead North and the drainage followed when I was"
1047,"ten or eleven, and all my childish memories are of digging and wheeling,"
1047,"of woods invaded by building, roads gashed open and littered with iron"
1047,"pipes amidst a fearful smell of gas, of men peeped at and seen toiling"
1047,"away deep down in excavations, of hedges broken down and replaced by"
1047,"planks, of wheelbarrows and builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and"
1047,"swallowed up by drain-pipes. Big trees, and especially elms, cleared"
1047,"of undergrowth and left standing amid such things, acquired a peculiar"
1047,"tattered dinginess rather in the quality of needy widow women who have"
1047,"seen happier days."
1047,""
1047,"The Ravensbrook of my earlier memories was a beautiful stream. It came"
1047,"into my world out of a mysterious Beyond, out of a garden, splashing"
1047,"brightly down a weir which had once been the weir of a mill. (Above the"
1047,"weir and inaccessible there were bulrushes growing in splendid clumps,"
1047,"and beyond that, pampas grass, yellow and crimson spikes of hollyhock,"
1047,"and blue suggestions of wonderland.) From the pool at the foot of"
1047,"this initial cascade it flowed in a leisurely fashion beside a"
1047,"footpath,--there were two pretty thatched cottages on the left, and here"
1047,"were ducks, and there were willows on the right,--and so came to where"
1047,"great trees grew on high banks on either hand and bowed closer, and at"
1047,"last met overhead. This part was difficult to reach because of an old"
1047,"fence, but a little boy might glimpse that long cavern of greenery by"
1047,"wading. Either I have actually seen kingfishers there, or my father has"
1047,"described them so accurately to me that he inserted them into my"
1047,"memory. I remember them there anyhow. Most of that overhung part I never"
1047,"penetrated at all, but followed the field path with my mother and met"
1047,"the stream again, where beyond there were flat meadows, Roper's meadows."
1047,"The Ravensbrook went meandering across the middle of these, now between"
1047,"steep banks, and now with wide shallows at the bends where the cattle"
1047,"waded and drank. Yellow and purple loose-strife and ordinary rushes grew"
1047,"in clumps along the bank, and now and then a willow. On rare occasions"
1047,"of rapture one might see a rat cleaning his whiskers at the water's"
1047,"edge. The deep places were rich with tangled weeds, and in them fishes"
1047,"lurked--to me they were big fishes--water-boatmen and water-beetles"
1047,"traversed the calm surface of these still deeps; in one pool were yellow"
1047,"lilies and water-soldiers, and in the shoaly places hovering fleets of"
1047,"small fry basked in the sunshine--to vanish in a flash at one's shadow."
1047,"In one place, too, were Rapids, where the stream woke with a start from"
1047,"a dreamless brooding into foaming panic and babbled and hastened. Well"
1047,"do I remember that half-mile of rivulet; all other rivers and cascades"
1047,"have their reference to it for me. And after I was eleven, and before we"
1047,"left Bromstead, all the delight and beauty of it was destroyed."
1047,""
1047,"The volume of its water decreased abruptly--I suppose the new drainage"
1047,"works that linked us up with Beckington, and made me first acquainted"
1047,"with the geological quality of the London clay, had to do with"
1047,"that--until only a weak uncleansing trickle remained. That at first"
1047,"did not strike me as a misfortune. An adventurous small boy might walk"
1047,"dryshod in places hitherto inaccessible. But hard upon that came the"
1047,"pegs, the planks and carts and devastation. Roper's meadows, being no"
1047,"longer in fear of floods, were now to be slashed out into parallelograms"
1047,"of untidy road, and built upon with rows of working-class cottages. The"
1047,"roads came,--horribly; the houses followed. They seemed to rise in"
1047,"the night. People moved into them as soon as the roofs were on, mostly"
1047,"workmen and their young wives, and already in a year some of these raw"
1047,"houses stood empty again from defaulting tenants, with windows broken"
1047,"and wood-work warping and rotting. The Ravensbrook became a dump for"
1047,"old iron, rusty cans, abandoned boots and the like, and was a river"
1047,"only when unusual rains filled it for a day or so with an inky flood of"
1047,"surface water...."
1047,""
1047,"That indeed was my most striking perception in the growth of Bromstead."
1047,"The Ravensbrook had been important to my imaginative life; that way"
1047,"had always been my first choice in all my walks with my mother, and its"
1047,"rapid swamping by the new urban growth made it indicative of all the"
1047,"other things that had happened just before my time, or were still, at a"
1047,"less dramatic pace, happening. I realised that building was the enemy."
1047,"I began to understand why in every direction out of Bromstead one walked"
1047,"past scaffold-poles into litter, why fragments of broken brick and"
1047,"cinder mingled in every path, and the significance of the universal"
1047,"notice-boards, either white and new or a year old and torn and battered,"
1047,"promising sites, proffering houses to be sold or let, abusing and"
1047,"intimidating passers-by for fancied trespass, and protecting rights of"
1047,"way."
1047,""
1047,"It is difficult to disentangle now what I understood at this time and"
1047,"what I have since come to understand, but it seems to me that even"
1047,"in those childish days I was acutely aware of an invading and growing"
1047,"disorder. The serene rhythms of the old established agriculture, I see"
1047,"now, were everywhere being replaced by cultivation under notice and"
1047,"snatch crops; hedges ceased to be repaired, and were replaced by cheap"
1047,"iron railings or chunks of corrugated iron; more and more hoardings"
1047,"sprang up, and contributed more and more to the nomad tribes of filthy"
1047,"paper scraps that flew before the wind and overspread the country."
1047,"The outskirts of Bromstead were a maze of exploitation roads that"
1047,"led nowhere, that ended in tarred fences studded with nails (I don't"
1047,"remember barbed wire in those days; I think the Zeitgeist did not"
1047,"produce that until later), and in trespass boards that used vehement"
1047,"language. Broken glass, tin cans, and ashes and paper abounded. Cheap"
1047,"glass, cheap tin, abundant fuel, and a free untaxed Press had rushed"
1047,"upon a world quite unprepared to dispose of these blessings when the"
1047,"fulness of enjoyment was past."
1047,""
1047,"I suppose one might have persuaded oneself that all this was but the"
1047,"replacement of an ancient tranquillity, or at least an ancient balance,"
1047,"by a new order. Only to my eyes, quickened by my father's intimations,"
1047,"it was manifestly no order at all. It was a multitude of incoordinated"
1047,"fresh starts, each more sweeping and destructive than the last, and none"
1047,"of them ever really worked out to a ripe and satisfactory completion."
1047,"Each left a legacy of products, houses, humanity, or what not, in its"
1047,"wake. It was a sort of progress that had bolted; it was change out of"
1047,"hand, and going at an unprecedented pace nowhere in particular."
1047,""
1047,"No, the Victorian epoch was not the dawn of a new era; it was a hasty,"
1047,"trial experiment, a gigantic experiment of the most slovenly and"
1047,"wasteful kind. I suppose it was necessary; I suppose all things are"
1047,"necessary. I suppose that before men will discipline themselves to learn"
1047,"and plan, they must first see in a hundred convincing forms the folly"
1047,"and muddle that come from headlong, aimless and haphazard methods."
1047,"The nineteenth century was an age of demonstrations, some of them very"
1047,"impressive demonstrations, of the powers that have come to mankind, but"
1047,"of permanent achievement, what will our descendants cherish? It is hard"
1047,"to estimate what grains of precious metal may not be found in a mud"
1047,"torrent of human production on so large a scale, but will any one, a"
1047,"hundred years from now, consent to live in the houses the Victorians"
1047,"built, travel by their roads or railways, value the furnishings they"
1047,"made to live among or esteem, except for curious or historical reasons,"
1047,"their prevalent art and the clipped and limited literature that"
1047,"satisfied their souls?"
1047,""
1047,"That age which bore me was indeed a world full of restricted and"
1047,"undisciplined people, overtaken by power, by possessions and great"
1047,"new freedoms, and unable to make any civilised use of them whatever;"
1047,"stricken now by this idea and now by that, tempted first by one"
1047,"possession and then another to ill-considered attempts; it was my"
1047,"father's exploitation of his villa gardens on the wholesale level. The"
1047,"whole of Bromstead as I remember it, and as I saw it last--it is a year"
1047,"ago now--is a dull useless boiling-up of human activities, an immense"
1047,"clustering of futilities. It is as unfinished as ever; the builders'"
1047,"roads still run out and end in mid-field in their old fashion; the"
1047,"various enterprises jumble in the same hopeless contradiction, if"
1047,"anything intensified. Pretentious villas jostle slums, and public-house"
1047,"and tin tabernacle glower at one another across the cat-haunted lot that"
1047,"intervenes. Roper's meadows are now quite frankly a slum; back doors and"
1047,"sculleries gape towards the railway, their yards are hung with tattered"
1047,"washing unashamed; and there seem to be more boards by the railway every"
1047,"time I pass, advertising pills and pickles, tonics and condiments, and"
1047,"suchlike solicitudes of a people with no natural health nor appetite"
1047,"left in them...."
1047,""
1047,"Well, we have to do better. Failure is not failure nor waste wasted if"
1047,"it sweeps away illusion and lights the road to a plan."

1047,""
1047,"Chaotic indiscipline, ill-adjusted effort, spasmodic aims, these give"
1047,"the quality of all my Bromstead memories. The crowning one of them all"
1047,"rises to desolating tragedy. I remember now the wan spring sunshine of"
1047,"that Sunday morning, the stiff feeling of best clothes and aggressive"
1047,"cleanliness and formality, when I and my mother returned from church to"
1047,"find my father dead. He had been pruning the grape vine. He had"
1047,"never had a ladder long enough to reach the sill of the third-floor"
1047,"windows--at house-painting times he had borrowed one from the plumber"
1047,"who mixed his paint--and he had in his own happy-go-lucky way contrived"
1047,"a combination of the garden fruit ladder with a battered kitchen table"
1047,"that served all sorts of odd purposes in an outhouse. He had stayed up"
1047,"this arrangement by means of the garden roller, and the roller had at"
1047,"the critical moment--rolled. He was lying close by the garden door with"
1047,"his head queerly bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe,"
1047,"an expression of pacific contentment on his face, a bamboo curtain rod"
1047,"with a tableknife tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand. We had"
1047,"been rapping for some time at the front door unable to make him hear,"
1047,"and then we came round by the door in the side trellis into the garden"
1047,"and so discovered him."
1047,""
1047,"""Arthur!"" I remember my mother crying with the strangest break in her"
1047,"voice, ""What are you doing there? Arthur! And--SUNDAY!"""
1047,""
1047,"I was coming behind her, musing remotely, when the quality of her voice"
1047,"roused me. She stood as if she could not go near him. He had always"
1047,"puzzled her so, he and his ways, and this seemed only another enigma."
1047,"Then the truth dawned on her, she shrieked as if afraid of him, ran a"
1047,"dozen steps back towards the trellis door and stopped and clasped her"
1047,"ineffectual gloved hands, leaving me staring blankly, too astonished for"
1047,"feeling, at the carelessly flung limbs."
1047,""
1047,"The same idea came to me also. I ran to her. ""Mother!"" I cried, pale to"
1047,"the depths of my spirit, ""IS HE DEAD?"""
1047,""
1047,"I had been thinking two minutes before of the cold fruit pie that"
1047,"glorified our Sunday dinner-table, and how I might perhaps get into the"
1047,"tree at the end of the garden to read in the afternoon. Now an immense"
1047,"fact had come down like a curtain and blotted out all my childish world."
1047,"My father was lying dead before my eyes.... I perceived that my mother"
1047,"was helpless and that things must be done."
1047,""
1047,"""Mother!"" I said, ""we must get Doctor Beaseley,--and carry him indoors."""

1047,"CHAPTER THE THIRD ~~ SCHOLASTIC"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,"My formal education began in a small preparatory school in Bromstead."
1047,"I went there as a day boy. The charge for my instruction was mainly set"
1047,"off by the periodic visits of my father with a large bag of battered"
1047,"fossils to lecture to us upon geology. I was one of those fortunate"
1047,"youngsters who take readily to school work, I had a good memory,"
1047,"versatile interests and a considerable appetite for commendation, and"
1047,"when I was barely twelve I got a scholarship at the City Merchants"
1047,"School and was entrusted with a scholar's railway season ticket to"
1047,"Victoria. After my father's death a large and very animated and solidly"
1047,"built uncle in tweeds from Staffordshire, Uncle Minter, my mother's"
1047,"sister's husband, with a remarkable accent and remarkable vowel sounds,"
1047,"who had plunged into the Bromstead home once or twice for the night but"
1047,"who was otherwise unknown to me, came on the scene, sold off the"
1047,"three gaunt houses with the utmost gusto, invested the proceeds and my"
1047,"father's life insurance money, and got us into a small villa at Penge"
1047,"within sight of that immense facade of glass and iron, the Crystal"
1047,"Palace. Then he retired in a mood of good-natured contempt to his native"
1047,"habitat again. We stayed at Penge until my mother's death."
1047,""
1047,"School became a large part of the world to me, absorbing my time and"
1047,"interest, and I never acquired that detailed and intimate knowledge of"
1047,"Penge and the hilly villadom round about, that I have of the town and"
1047,"outskirts of Bromstead."
1047,""
1047,"It was a district of very much the same character, but it was more"
1047,"completely urbanised and nearer to the centre of things; there were"
1047,"the same unfinished roads, the same occasional disconcerted hedges and"
1047,"trees, the same butcher's horse grazing under a builder's notice-board,"
1047,"the same incidental lapses into slum. The Crystal Palace grounds cut off"
1047,"a large part of my walking radius to the west with impassable fences"
1047,"and forbiddingly expensive turnstiles, but it added to the ordinary"
1047,"spectacle of meteorology a great variety of gratuitous fireworks which"
1047,"banged and flared away of a night after supper and drew me abroad to see"
1047,"them better. Such walks as I took, to Croydon, Wembledon, West Wickham"
1047,"and Greenwich, impressed upon me the interminable extent of London's"
1047,"residential suburbs; mile after mile one went, between houses, villas,"
1047,"rows of cottages, streets of shops, under railway arches, over railway"
1047,"bridges. I have forgotten the detailed local characteristics--if there"
1047,"were any--of much of that region altogether. I was only there two years,"
1047,"and half my perambulations occurred at dusk or after dark. But with"
1047,"Penge I associate my first realisations of the wonder and beauty of"
1047,"twilight and night, the effect of dark walls reflecting lamplight, and"
1047,"the mystery of blue haze-veiled hillsides of houses, the glare of shops"
1047,"by night, the glowing steam and streaming sparks of railway trains and"
1047,"railway signals lit up in the darkness. My first rambles in the evening"
1047,"occurred at Penge--I was becoming a big and independent-spirited"
1047,"boy--and I began my experience of smoking during these twilight prowls"
1047,"with the threepenny packets of American cigarettes then just appearing"
1047,"in the world."
1047,""
1047,"My life centred upon the City Merchants School. Usually I caught the"
1047,"eight-eighteen for Victoria, I had a midday meal and tea; four nights a"
1047,"week I stayed for preparation, and often I was not back home again until"
1047,"within an hour of my bedtime. I spent my half holidays at school"
1047,"in order to play cricket and football. This, and a pretty voracious"
1047,"appetite for miscellaneous reading which was fostered by the Penge"
1047,"Middleton Library, did not leave me much leisure for local topography."
1047,"On Sundays also I sang in the choir at St. Martin's Church, and my"
1047,"mother did not like me to walk out alone on the Sabbath afternoon, she"
1047,"herself slumbered, so that I wrote or read at home. I must confess I was"
1047,"at home as little as I could contrive."
1047,""
1047,"Home, after my father's death, had become a very quiet and uneventful"
1047,"place indeed. My mother had either an unimaginative temperament or her"
1047,"mind was greatly occupied with private religious solicitudes, and I"
1047,"remember her talking to me but little, and that usually upon topics"
1047,"I was anxious to evade. I had developed my own view about low-Church"
1047,"theology long before my father's death, and my meditation upon that"
1047,"event had finished my secret estrangement from my mother's faith. My"
1047,"reason would not permit even a remote chance of his being in hell, he"
1047,"was so manifestly not evil, and this religion would not permit him a"
1047,"remote chance of being out yet. When I was a little boy my mother had"
1047,"taught me to read and write and pray and had done many things for me,"
1047,"indeed she persisted in washing me and even in making my clothes until I"
1047,"rebelled against these things as indignities. But our minds parted very"
1047,"soon. She never began to understand the mental processes of my play,"
1047,"she never interested herself in my school life and work, she could not"
1047,"understand things I said; and she came, I think, quite insensibly to"
1047,"regard me with something of the same hopeless perplexity she had felt"
1047,"towards my father."
1047,""
1047,"Him she must have wedded under considerable delusions. I do not think"
1047,"he deceived her, indeed, nor do I suspect him of mercenariness in"
1047,"their union; but no doubt he played up to her requirements in the half"
1047,"ingenuous way that was and still is the quality of most wooing, and"
1047,"presented himself as a very brisk and orthodox young man. I wonder why"
1047,"nearly all love-making has to be fraudulent. Afterwards he must have"
1047,"disappointed her cruelly by letting one aspect after another of his"
1047,"careless, sceptical, experimental temperament appear. Her mind was fixed"
1047,"and definite, she embodied all that confidence in church and decorum and"
1047,"the assurances of the pulpit which was characteristic of the large mass"
1047,"of the English people--for after all, the rather low-Church section WAS"
1047,"the largest single mass--in early Victorian times. She had dreams, I"
1047,"suspect, of going to church with him side by side; she in a little"
1047,"poke bonnet and a large flounced crinoline, all mauve and magenta and"
1047,"starched under a little lace-trimmed parasol, and he in a tall silk hat"
1047,"and peg-top trousers and a roll-collar coat, and looking rather like"
1047,"the Prince Consort,--white angels almost visibly raining benedictions on"
1047,"their amiable progress. Perhaps she dreamt gently of much-belaced babies"
1047,"and an interestingly pious (but not too dissenting or fanatical) little"
1047,"girl or boy or so, also angel-haunted. And I think, too, she must have"
1047,"seen herself ruling a seemly ""home of taste,"" with a vivarium in the"
1047,"conservatory that opened out of the drawing-room, or again, making"
1047,"preserves in the kitchen. My father's science-teaching, his diagrams"
1047,"of disembowelled humanity, his pictures of prehistoric beasts that"
1047,"contradicted the Flood, his disposition towards soft shirts and loose"
1047,"tweed suits, his inability to use a clothes brush, his spasmodic reading"
1047,"fits and his bulldog pipes, must have jarred cruelly with her rather"
1047,"unintelligent anticipations. His wild moments of violent temper when he"
1047,"would swear and smash things, absurd almost lovable storms that passed"
1047,"like summer thunder, must have been starkly dreadful to her. She"
1047,"was constitutionally inadaptable, and certainly made no attempt to"
1047,"understand or tolerate these outbreaks. She tried them by her standards,"
1047,"and by her standards they were wrong. Her standards hid him from her."
1047,"The blazing things he said rankled in her mind unforgettably."
1047,""
1047,"As I remember them together they chafed constantly. Her attitude"
1047,"to nearly all his moods and all his enterprises was a sceptical"
1047,"disapproval. She treated him as something that belonged to me and not"
1047,"to her. ""YOUR father,"" she used to call him, as though I had got him for"
1047,"her."
1047,""
1047,"She had married late and she had, I think, become mentally"
1047,"self-subsisting before her marriage. Even in those Herne Hill days"
1047,"I used to wonder what was going on in her mind, and I find that old"
1047,"speculative curiosity return as I write this. She took a considerable"
1047,"interest in the housework that our generally servantless condition put"
1047,"upon her--she used to have a charwoman in two or three times a week--but"
1047,"she did not do it with any great skill. She covered most of our"
1047,"furniture with flouncey ill-fitting covers, and she cooked plainly and"
1047,"without very much judgment. The Penge house, as it contained nearly"
1047,"all our Bromstead things, was crowded with furniture, and is chiefly"
1047,"associated in my mind with the smell of turpentine, a condiment she used"
1047,"very freely upon the veneered mahogany pieces. My mother had an equal"
1047,"dread of ""blacks"" by day and the ""night air,"" so that our brightly clean"
1047,"windows were rarely open."
1047,""
1047,"She took a morning paper, and she would open it and glance at the"
1047,"headlines, but she did not read it until the afternoon and then, I"
1047,"think, she was interested only in the more violent crimes, and in"
1047,"railway and mine disasters and in the minutest domesticities of the"
1047,"Royal Family. Most of the books at home were my father's, and I do not"
1047,"think she opened any of them. She had one or two volumes that dated from"
1047,"her own youth, and she tried in vain to interest me in them; there was"
1047,"Miss Strickland's QUEENS OF ENGLAND, a book I remember with particular"
1047,"animosity, and QUEECHY and the WIDE WIDE WORLD. She made these books of"
1047,"hers into a class apart by sewing outer covers upon them of calico and"
1047,"figured muslin. To me in these habiliments they seemed not so much books"
1047,"as confederated old ladies."
1047,""
1047,"My mother was also very punctual with her religious duties, and rejoiced"
1047,"to watch me in the choir."
1047,""
1047,"On winter evenings she occupied an armchair on the other side of the"
1047,"table at which I sat, head on hand reading, and she would be darning"
1047,"stockings or socks or the like. We achieved an effect of rather stuffy"
1047,"comfortableness that was soporific, and in a passive way I think she"
1047,"found these among her happy times. On such occasions she was wont to put"
1047,"her work down on her knees and fall into a sort of thoughtless musing"
1047,"that would last for long intervals and rouse my curiosity. For like most"
1047,"young people I could not imagine mental states without definite forms."
1047,""
1047,"She carried on a correspondence with a number of cousins and friends,"
1047,"writing letters in a slanting Italian hand and dealing mainly with"
1047,"births, marriages and deaths, business starts (in the vaguest terms) and"
1047,"the distresses of bankruptcy."
1047,""
1047,"And yet, you know, she did have a curious intimate life of her own that"
1047,"I suspected nothing of at the time, that only now becomes credible"
1047,"to me. She kept a diary that is still in my possession, a diary of"
1047,"fragmentary entries in a miscellaneous collection of pocket books. She"
1047,"put down the texts of the sermons she heard, and queer stiff little"
1047,"comments on casual visitors,--""Miss G. and much noisy shrieking talk"
1047,"about games and such frivolities and CROQUAY. A. delighted and VERY"
1047,"ATTENTIVE."" Such little human entries abound. She had an odd way of"
1047,"never writing a name, only an initial; my father is always ""A.,"" and I"
1047,"am always ""D."" It is manifest she followed the domestic events in the"
1047,"life of the Princess of Wales, who is now Queen Mother, with peculiar"
1047,"interest and sympathy. ""Pray G. all may be well,"" she writes in one such"
1047,"crisis."
1047,""
1047,"But there are things about myself that I still find too poignant to tell"
1047,"easily, certain painful and clumsy circumstances of my birth in very"
1047,"great detail, the distresses of my infantile ailments. Then later I"
1047,"find such things as this: ""Heard D. s----."" The ""s"" is evidently ""swear"
1047,"""--""G. bless and keep my boy from evil."" And again, with the thin"
1047,"handwriting shaken by distress: ""D. would not go to church, and hardened"
1047,"his heart and said wicked infidel things, much disrespect of the clergy."
1047,"The anthem is tiresome!!! That men should set up to be wiser than"
1047,"their maker!!!"" Then trebly underlined: ""I FEAR HIS FATHER'S TEACHING."""
1047,"Dreadful little tangle of misapprehensions and false judgments! More"
1047,"comforting for me to read, ""D. very kind and good. He grows more"
1047,"thoughtful every day."" I suspect myself of forgotten hypocrisies."
1047,""
1047,"At just one point my mother's papers seem to dip deeper. I think the"
1047,"death of my father must have stirred her for the first time for many"
1047,"years to think for herself. Even she could not go on living in any peace"
1047,"at all, believing that he had indeed been flung headlong into hell. Of"
1047,"this gnawing solicitude she never spoke to me, never, and for her diary"
1047,"also she could find no phrases. But on a loose half-sheet of notepaper"
1047,"between its pages I find this passage that follows, written very"
1047,"carefully. I do not know whose lines they are nor how she came upon"
1047,"them. They run:--"
1047,""
1047,"     ""And if there be no meeting past the grave;"
1047,"      If all is darkness, silence, yet 'tis rest."
1047,"      Be not afraid ye waiting hearts that weep,"
1047,"      For God still giveth His beloved sleep,"
1047,"      And if an endless sleep He wills, so best."""
1047,""
1047,"That scrap of verse amazed me when I read it. I could even wonder if my"
1047,"mother really grasped the import of what she had copied out. It affected"
1047,"me as if a stone-deaf person had suddenly turned and joined in a"
1047,"whispered conversation. It set me thinking how far a mind in its general"
1047,"effect quite hopelessly limited, might range. After that I went through"
1047,"all her diaries, trying to find something more than a conventional term"
1047,"of tenderness for my father. But I found nothing. And yet somehow there"
1047,"grew upon me the realisation that there had been love.... Her love for"
1047,"me, on the other hand, was abundantly expressed."
1047,""
1047,"I knew nothing of that secret life of feeling at the time; such"
1047,"expression as it found was all beyond my schoolboy range. I did not know"
1047,"when I pleased her and I did not know when I distressed her. Chiefly"
1047,"I was aware of my mother as rather dull company, as a mind thorny with"
1047,"irrational conclusions and incapable of explication, as one believing"
1047,"quite wilfully and irritatingly in impossible things. So I suppose it"
1047,"had to be; life was coming to me in new forms and with new requirements."
1047,"It was essential to our situation that we should fail to understand."
1047,"After this space of years I have come to realisations and attitudes that"
1047,"dissolve my estrangement from her, I can pierce these barriers, I"
1047,"can see her and feel her as a loving and feeling and desiring and"
1047,"muddle-headed person. There are times when I would have her alive again,"
1047,"if only that I might be kind to her for a little while and give her"
1047,"some return for the narrow intense affection, the tender desires, she"
1047,"evidently lavished so abundantly on me. But then again I ask how I"
1047,"could make that return? And I realise the futility of such dreaming. Her"
1047,"demand was rigid, and to meet it I should need to act and lie."
1047,""
1047,"So she whose blood fed me, whose body made me, lies in my memory as I"
1047,"saw her last, fixed, still, infinitely intimate, infinitely remote...."

1047,"My own case with my mother, however, does not awaken the same regret I"
1047,"feel when I think of how she misjudged and irked my father, and turned"
1047,"his weaknesses into thorns for her own tormenting. I wish I could look"
1047,"back without that little twinge to two people who were both in their"
1047,"different quality so good. But goodness that is narrow is a pedestrian"
1047,"and ineffectual goodness. Her attitude to my father seems to me one of"
1047,"the essentially tragic things that have come to me personally, one of"
1047,"those things that nothing can transfigure, that REMAIN sorrowful, that I"
1047,"cannot soothe with any explanation, for as I remember him he was indeed"
1047,"the most lovable of weak spasmodic men. But my mother had been trained"
1047,"in a hard and narrow system that made evil out of many things not in"
1047,"the least evil, and inculcated neither kindliness nor charity. All their"
1047,"estrangement followed from that."
1047,""
1047,"These cramping cults do indeed take an enormous toll of human love"
1047,"and happiness, and not only that but what we Machiavellians must needs"
1047,"consider, they make frightful breaches in human solidarity. I suppose I"
1047,"am a deeply religious man, as men of my quality go, but I hate more"
1047,"and more, as I grow older, the shadow of intolerance cast by religious"
1047,"organisations. All my life has been darkened by irrational intolerance,"
1047,"by arbitrary irrational prohibitions and exclusions. Mahometanism"
1047,"with its fierce proselytism, has, I suppose, the blackest record of"
1047,"uncharitableness, but most of the Christian sects are tainted, tainted"
1047,"to a degree beyond any of the anterior paganisms, with this same hateful"
1047,"quality. It is their exclusive claim that sends them wrong, the vain"
1047,"ambition that inspires them all to teach a uniform one-sided God and be"
1047,"the one and only gateway to salvation. Deprecation of all outside the"
1047,"household of faith, an organised undervaluation of heretical goodness"
1047,"and lovableness, follows, necessarily. Every petty difference is"
1047,"exaggerated to the quality of a saving grace or a damning defect."
1047,"Elaborate precautions are taken to shield the believer's mind against"
1047,"broad or amiable suggestions; the faithful are deterred by dark"
1047,"allusions, by sinister warnings, from books, from theatres, from"
1047,"worldly conversation, from all the kindly instruments that mingle human"
1047,"sympathy. For only by isolating its flock can the organisation survive."

1047,"Every month there came to my mother a little magazine called, if I"
1047,"remember rightly, the HOME CHURCHMAN, with the combined authority of"
1047,"print and clerical commendation. It was the most evil thing that ever"
1047,"came into the house, a very devil, a thin little pamphlet with"
1047,"one woodcut illustration on the front page of each number; now the"
1047,"uninviting visage of some exponent of the real and only doctrine and"
1047,"attitudes, now some coral strand in act of welcoming the missionaries of"
1047,"God's mysterious preferences, now a new church in the Victorian Gothic."
1047,"The vile rag it was! A score of vices that shun the policeman have"
1047,"nothing of its subtle wickedness. It was an outrage upon the natural"
1047,"kindliness of men. The contents were all admirably adjusted to keep a"
1047,"spirit in prison. Their force of sustained suggestion was tremendous."
1047,"There would be dreadful intimations of the swift retribution that fell"
1047,"upon individuals for Sabbath-breaking, and upon nations for weakening"
1047,"towards Ritualism, or treating Roman Catholics as tolerable human"
1047,"beings; there would be great rejoicings over the conversion of alleged"
1047,"Jews, and terrible descriptions of the death-beds of prominent infidels"
1047,"with boldly invented last words,--the most unscrupulous lying; there"
1047,"would be the appallingly edifying careers of ""early piety"" lusciously"

1047,"I heard the paper's name with a queer little shock and surveyed the"

1047,"discords who darkened my boyhood. It was amazing to find an influence"
1047,"so terrible embodied in a creature so palpably petty. He was seated some"
1047,"way down a table at right angles to the one at which I sat, a man of"
1047,"mean appearance with a greyish complexion, thin, with a square nose,"
1047,"a heavy wiry moustache and a big Adam's apple sticking out between the"
1047,"wings of his collar. He ate with considerable appetite and unconcealed"
1047,"relish, and as his jaw was underhung, he chummed and made the moustache"
1047,"wave like reeds in the swell of a steamer. It gave him a conscientious"
1047,"look. After dinner he a little forced himself upon me. At that time,"
1047,"though the shadow of my scandal was already upon me, I still seemed to"
1047,"be shaping for great successes, and he was glad to be in conversation"
1047,"with me and anxious to intimate political sympathy and support. I tried"
1047,"to make him talk of the HOME CHURCHMAN and the kindred publications he"

1047,"whiskers and a long bare upper lip. The Jesuits, it seemed, were still"
1047,"hard at it, and Heaven frightfully upset about the Sunday opening of"
1047,"museums and the falling birth-rate, and as touchy and vindictive as"
1047,"ever. There were two vigorous paragraphs upon the utter damnableness"
1047,"of the Rev. R. J. Campbell, a contagious damnableness I gathered, one"
1047,"wasn't safe within a mile of Holborn Viaduct, and a foul-mouthed"

1047,"While I lived at Penge two little things happened to me, trivial in"
1047,"themselves and yet in their quality profoundly significant. They had"
1047,"this in common, that they pierced the texture of the life I was quietly"
1047,"taking for granted and let me see through it into realities--realities"
1047,"I had indeed known about before but never realised. Each of these"
1047,"experiences left me with a sense of shock, with all the values in"
1047,"my life perplexingly altered, attempting readjustment. One of these"
1047,"disturbing and illuminating events was that I was robbed of a new"
1047,"pocket-knife and the other that I fell in love. It was altogether"
1047,"surprising to me to be robbed. You see, as an only child I had always"
1047,"been fairly well looked after and protected, and the result was an"
1047,"amazing confidence in the practical goodness of the people one met in"
1047,"the world. I knew there were robbers in the world, just as I knew there"
1047,"were tigers; that I was ever likely to meet robber or tiger face to face"
1047,"seemed equally impossible."
1047,""
1047,"The knife as I remember it was a particularly jolly one with all sorts"
1047,"of instruments in it, tweezers and a thing for getting a stone out"
1047,"of the hoof of a horse, and a corkscrew; it had cost me a carefully"
1047,"accumulated half-crown, and amounted indeed to a new experience in"
1047,"knives. I had had it for two or three days, and then one afternoon I"
1047,"dropped it through a hole in my pocket on a footpath crossing a field"
1047,"between Penge and Anerley. I heard it fall in the way one does without"
1047,"at the time appreciating what had happened, then, later, before I got"
1047,"home, when my hand wandered into my pocket to embrace the still dear"
1047,"new possession I found it gone, and instantly that memory of something"
1047,"hitting the ground sprang up into consciousness. I went back and"
1047,"commenced a search. Almost immediately I was accosted by the leader of a"
1047,"little gang of four or five extremely dirty and ragged boys of assorted"
1047,"sizes and slouching carriage who were coming from the Anerley direction."
1047,""
1047,"""Lost anythink, Matey?"" said he."
1047,""
1047,"I explained."

1047,"boy in a big bowler hat."

1047,"I supplied the information. His sharp little face scrutinised the ground"

1047,"""GOT it,"" he said, and pounced."

1047,"""Give it 'ere,"" said the big boy hoarsely, and secured it."

1047,"""No bloomin' fear!"" he said, regarding me obliquely. ""Oo said it was"

1047,""
1047,"Remarkable doubts assailed me. ""Of course it's my knife,"" I said. The"
1047,"other boys gathered round me."
1047,""
1047,"""This ain't your knife,"" said the big boy, and spat casually."
1047,""
1047,"""I dropped it just now."""
1047,""
1047,"""Findin's keepin's, I believe,"" said the big boy."

1047,"""Look here!"" I said. ""I saw that kid pick it up. It IS my knife."""
1047,""
1047,"""Rot!"" said the big boy, and slowly, deliberately put my knife into his"
1047,"trouser pocket."
1047,""
1047,"I braced my soul for battle. All civilisation was behind me, but I doubt"
1047,"if it kept the colour in my face. I buttoned my jacket and clenched my"
1047,"fists and advanced on my antagonist--he had, I suppose, the advantage of"
1047,"two years of age and three inches of height. ""Hand over that knife,"" I"
1047,"said."
1047,""
1047,"Then one of the smallest of the band assailed me with extraordinary"
1047,"vigour and swiftness from behind, had an arm round my neck and a knee in"
1047,"my back before I had the slightest intimation of attack, and so got me"
1047,"down. ""I got 'im, Bill,"" squeaked this amazing little ruffian. My nose"
1047,"was flattened by a dirty hand, and as I struck out and hit something"
1047,"like sacking, some one kicked my elbow. Two or three seemed to be at"
1047,"me at the same time. Then I rolled over and sat up to discover them all"
1047,"making off, a ragged flight, footballing my cap, my City Merchants' cap,"
1047,"amongst them. I leapt to my feet in a passion of indignation and pursued"
1047,"them."
1047,""
1047,"But I did not overtake them. We are beings of mixed composition, and I"
1047,"doubt if mine was a single-minded pursuit. I knew that honour required"
1047,"me to pursue, and I had a vivid impression of having just been down"
1047,"in the dust with a very wiry and active and dirty little antagonist of"
1047,"disagreeable odour and incredible and incalculable unscrupulousness,"
1047,"kneeling on me and gripping my arm and neck. I wanted of course to be"
1047,"even with him, but also I doubted if catching him would necessarily"
1047,"involve that. They kicked my cap into the ditch at the end of the field,"
1047,"and made off compactly along a cinder lane while I turned aside to"
1047,"recover my dishonoured headdress. As I knocked the dust out of that and"
1047,"out of my jacket, and brushed my knees and readjusted my very crumpled"
1047,"collar, I tried to focus this startling occurrence in my mind."
1047,""
1047,"I had vague ideas of going to a policeman or of complaining at a police"
1047,"station, but some boyish instinct against informing prevented that. No"
1047,"doubt I entertained ideas of vindictive pursuit and murderous reprisals."
1047,"And I was acutely enraged whenever I thought of my knife. The thing"
1047,"indeed rankled in my mind for weeks and weeks, and altered all the"
1047,"flavour of my world for me. It was the first time I glimpsed the simple"
1047,"brute violence that lurks and peeps beneath our civilisation. A certain"
1047,"kindly complacency of attitude towards the palpably lower classes was"
1047,"qualified for ever."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"4"
1047,""
1047,"But the other experience was still more cardinal. It was the first clear"
1047,"intimation of a new motif in life, the sex motif, that was to rise and"
1047,"increase and accumulate power and enrichment and interweave with and at"
1047,"last dominate all my life."
1047,""
1047,"It was when I was nearly fifteen this happened. It is inseparably"
1047,"connected in my mind with the dusk of warm September evenings. I never"
1047,"met the girl I loved by daylight, and I have forgotten her name. It was"
1047,"some insignificant name."
1047,""
1047,"Yet the peculiar quality of the adventure keeps it shining darkly like"
1047,"some deep coloured gem in the common setting of my memories. It came as"
1047,"something new and strange, something that did not join on to anything"
1047,"else in my life or connect with any of my thoughts or beliefs or habits;"
1047,"it was a wonder, a mystery, a discovery about myself, a discovery"
1047,"about the whole world. Only in after years did sexual feeling lose that"
1047,"isolation and spread itself out to illuminate and pervade and at last"
1047,"possess the whole broad vision of life."
1047,""
1047,"It was in that phase of an urban youth's development, the phase of the"
1047,"cheap cigarette, that this thing happened. One evening I came by chance"
1047,"on a number of young people promenading by the light of a row of shops"
1047,"towards Beckington, and, with all the glory of a glowing cigarette"
1047,"between my lips, I joined their strolling number. These twilight parades"
1047,"of young people, youngsters chiefly of the lower middle-class, are one"
1047,"of the odd social developments of the great suburban growths--unkindly"
1047,"critics, blind to the inner meanings of things, call them, I believe,"
1047,"Monkeys' Parades--the shop apprentices, the young work girls, the boy"
1047,"clerks and so forth, stirred by mysterious intimations, spend their"
1047,"first-earned money upon collars and ties, chiffon hats, smart lace"
1047,"collars, walking-sticks, sunshades or cigarettes, and come valiantly"
1047,"into the vague transfiguring mingling of gaslight and evening, to walk"
1047,"up and down, to eye meaningly, even to accost and make friends. It is"
1047,"a queer instinctive revolt from the narrow limited friendless homes in"
1047,"which so many find themselves, a going out towards something, romance if"
1047,"you will, beauty, that has suddenly become a need--a need that hitherto"
1047,"has lain dormant and unsuspected. They promenade."
1047,""
1047,"Vulgar!--it is as vulgar as the spirit that calls the moth abroad in the"
1047,"evening and lights the body of the glow-worm in the night. I made my"
1047,"way through the throng, a little contemptuously as became a public"
1047,"schoolboy, my hands in my pockets--none of your cheap canes for me!--and"
1047,"very careful of the lie of my cigarette upon my lips. And two girls"
1047,"passed me, one a little taller than the other, with dim warm-tinted"
1047,"faces under clouds of dark hair and with dark eyes like pools reflecting"
1047,"stars."
1047,""
1047,"I half turned, and the shorter one glanced back at me over her"
1047,"shoulder--I could draw you now the pose of her cheek and neck and"
1047,"shoulder--and instantly I was as passionately in love with the girl as"
1047,"I have ever been before or since, as any man ever was with any woman. I"
1047,"turned about and followed them, I flung away my cigarette ostentatiously"
1047,"and lifted my school cap and spoke to them."
1047,""
1047,"The girl answered shyly with her dark eyes on my face. What I said"
1047,"and what she said I cannot remember, but I have little doubt it was"
1047,"something absolutely vapid. It really did not matter; the thing was we"
1047,"had met. I felt as I think a new-hatched moth must feel when suddenly"
1047,"its urgent headlong searching brings it in tremulous amazement upon its"
1047,"mate."
1047,""
1047,"We met, covered from each other, with all the nets of civilisation"
1047,"keeping us apart. We walked side by side."
1047,""
1047,"It led to scarcely more than that. I think we met four or five times"
1047,"altogether, and always with her nearly silent elder sister on the other"
1047,"side of her. We walked on the last two occasions arm in arm, furtively"
1047,"caressing each other's hands, we went away from the glare of the shops"
1047,"into the quiet roads of villadom, and there we whispered instead of"
1047,"talking and looked closely into one another's warm and shaded face."
1047,"""Dear,"" I whispered very daringly, and she answered, ""Dear!"" We had a"
1047,"vague sense that we wanted more of that quality of intimacy and more. We"
1047,"wanted each other as one wants beautiful music again or to breathe again"
1047,"the scent of flowers."
1047,""
1047,"And that is all there was between us. The events are nothing, the thing"
1047,"that matters is the way in which this experience stabbed through the"
1047,"common stuff of life and left it pierced, with a light, with a huge new"
1047,"interest shining through the rent."
1047,""
1047,"When I think of it I can recall even now the warm mystery of her face,"
1047,"her lips a little apart, lips that I never kissed, her soft shadowed"
1047,"throat, and I feel again the sensuous stir of her proximity...."
1047,""
1047,"Those two girls never told me their surname nor let me approach their"
1047,"house. They made me leave them at the corner of a road of small houses"
1047,"near Penge Station. And quite abruptly, without any intimation, they"
1047,"vanished and came to the meeting place no more, they vanished as a"
1047,"moth goes out of a window into the night, and left me possessed of an"
1047,"intolerable want...."
1047,""
1047,"The affair pervaded my existence for many weeks. I could not do my work"
1047,"and I could not rest at home. Night after night I promenaded up and down"
1047,"that Monkeys' Parade full of an unappeasable desire, with a thwarted"
1047,"sense of something just begun that ought to have gone on. I went"
1047,"backwards and forwards on the way to the vanishing place, and at last"
1047,"explored the forbidden road that had swallowed them up. But I never saw"
1047,"her again, except that later she came to me, my symbol of womanhood, in"
1047,"dreams. How my blood was stirred! I lay awake of nights whispering in"
1047,"the darkness for her. I prayed for her."
1047,""
1047,"Indeed that girl, who probably forgot the last vestiges of me when her"
1047,"first real kiss came to her, ruled and haunted me, gave a Queen to my"
1047,"imagination and a texture to all my desires until I became a man."
1047,""
1047,"I generalised her at last. I suddenly discovered that poetry was about"
1047,"her and that she was the key to all that had hitherto seemed nonsense"
1047,"about love. I took to reading novels, and if the heroine could not"
1047,"possibly be like her, dusky and warm and starlike, I put the book"
1047,"aside...."
1047,""
1047,"I hesitate and add here one other confession. I want to tell this thing"
1047,"because it seems to me we are altogether too restrained and secretive"
1047,"about such matters. The cardinal thing in life sneaks in to us darkly"
1047,"and shamefully like a thief in the night."
1047,""
1047,"One day during my Cambridge days--it must have been in my first year"
1047,"before I knew Hatherleigh--I saw in a print-shop window near the Strand"
1047,"an engraving of a girl that reminded me sharply of Penge and its dusky"
1047,"encounter. It was just a half length of a bare-shouldered, bare-breasted"
1047,"Oriental with arms akimbo, smiling faintly. I looked at it, went my way,"
1047,"then turned back and bought it. I felt I must have it. The odd thing"
1047,"is that I was more than a little shamefaced about it. I did not have it"
1047,"framed and hung in my room open to the criticism of my friends, but I"
1047,"kept it in the drawer of my writing-table. And I kept that drawer locked"
1047,"for a year. It speedily merged with and became identified with the dark"
1047,"girl of Penge. That engraving became in a way my mistress. Often when I"
1047,"had sported my oak and was supposed to be reading, I was sitting with it"
1047,"before me."
1047,""
1047,"Obeying some instinct I kept the thing very secret indeed. For a time"
1047,"nobody suspected what was locked in my drawer nor what was locked in me."
1047,"I seemed as sexless as my world required."

1047,"The broad substance of my existence at this time was the City Merchants"
1047,"School. Home was a place where I slept and read, and the mooning"
1047,"explorations of the south-eastern postal district which occupied the"
1047,"restless evenings and spare days of my vacations mere interstices,"
1047,"giving glimpses of enigmatical lights and distant spaces between the"
1047,"woven threads of a school-boy's career. School life began for me every"
1047,"morning at Herne Hill, for there I was joined by three or four other"
1047,"boys and the rest of the way we went together. Most of the streets and"
1047,"roads we traversed in our morning's walk from Victoria are still intact,"
1047,"the storms of rebuilding that have submerged so much of my boyhood's"
1047,"London have passed and left them, and I have revived the impression of"
1047,"them again and again in recent years as I have clattered dinnerward in a"
1047,"hansom or hummed along in a motor cab to some engagement. The main gate"
1047,"still looks out with the same expression of ancient well-proportioned"
1047,"kindliness upon St. Margaret's Close. There are imposing new science"
1047,"laboratories in Chambers Street indeed, but the old playing fields are"
1047,"unaltered except for the big electric trams that go droning and spitting"
1047,"blue flashes along the western boundary. I know Ratten, the new Head,"
1047,"very well, but I have not been inside the school to see if it has"
1047,"changed at all since I went up to Cambridge."
1047,""
1047,"I took all they put before us very readily as a boy, for I had a mind of"
1047,"vigorous appetite, but since I have grown mentally to man's estate and"
1047,"developed a more and more comprehensive view of our national process"
1047,"and our national needs, I am more and more struck by the oddity of the"
1047,"educational methods pursued, their aimless disconnectedness from the"
1047,"constructive forces in the community. I suppose if we are to view the"
1047,"public school as anything more than an institution that has just chanced"
1047,"to happen, we must treat it as having a definite function towards the"
1047,"general scheme of the nation, as being in a sense designed to take the"
1047,"crude young male of the more or less responsible class, to correct"
1047,"his harsh egotisms, broaden his outlook, give him a grasp of the"
1047,"contemporary developments he will presently be called upon to influence"
1047,"and control, and send him on to the university to be made a leading and"
1047,"ruling social man. It is easy enough to carp at schoolmasters and set up"
1047,"for an Educational Reformer, I know, but still it is impossible not"
1047,"to feel how infinitely more effectually--given certain impossibilities"
1047,"perhaps--the job might be done."
1047,""
1047,"My memory of school has indeed no hint whatever of that quality of"
1047,"elucidation it seems reasonable to demand from it. Here all about me"
1047,"was London, a vast inexplicable being, a vortex of gigantic forces, that"
1047,"filled and overwhelmed me with impressions, that stirred my imagination"
1047,"to a perpetual vague enquiry; and my school not only offered no key"
1047,"to it, but had practically no comment to make upon it at all. We were"
1047,"within three miles of Westminster and Charing Cross, the government"
1047,"offices of a fifth of mankind were all within an hour's stroll, great"
1047,"economic changes were going on under our eyes, now the hoardings flamed"
1047,"with election placards, now the Salvation Army and now the unemployed"
1047,"came trailing in procession through the winter-grey streets, now the"
1047,"newspaper placards outside news-shops told of battles in strange places,"
1047,"now of amazing discoveries, now of sinister crimes, abject squalor and"
1047,"poverty, imperial splendour and luxury, Buckingham Palace, Rotten Row,"
1047,"Mayfair, the slums of Pimlico, garbage-littered streets of bawling"
1047,"costermongers, the inky silver of the barge-laden Thames--such was the"
1047,"background of our days. We went across St. Margaret's Close and through"
1047,"the school gate into a quiet puerile world apart from all these things."
1047,"We joined in the earnest acquirement of all that was necessary for Greek"
1047,"epigrams and Latin verse, and for the rest played games. We dipped down"
1047,"into something clear and elegantly proportioned and time-worn and for"
1047,"all its high resolve of stalwart virility a little feeble, like our"
1047,"blackened and decayed portals by Inigo Jones."
1047,""
1047,"Within, we were taught as the chief subjects of instruction, Latin and"
1047,"Greek. We were taught very badly because the men who taught us did not"
1047,"habitually use either of these languages, nobody uses them any more"
1047,"now except perhaps for the Latin of a few Levantine monasteries. At the"
1047,"utmost our men read them. We were taught these languages because long"
1047,"ago Latin had been the language of civilisation; the one way of escape"
1047,"from the narrow and localised life had lain in those days through Latin,"
1047,"and afterwards Greek had come in as the vehicle of a flood of new and"
1047,"amazing ideas. Once these two languages had been the sole means of"
1047,"initiation to the detached criticism and partial comprehension of the"
1047,"world. I can imagine the fierce zeal of our first Heads, Gardener and"
1047,"Roper, teaching Greek like passionate missionaries, as a progressive"
1047,"Chinaman might teach English to the boys of Pekin, clumsily,"
1047,"impatiently, with rod and harsh urgency, but sincerely, patriotically,"
1047,"because they felt that behind it lay revelations, the irresistible"
1047,"stimulus to a new phase of history. That was long ago. A new great"
1047,"world, a vaster Imperialism had arisen about the school, had assimilated"
1047,"all these amazing and incredible ideas, had gone on to new and yet more"
1047,"amazing developments of its own. But the City Merchants School still"
1047,"made the substance of its teaching Latin and Greek, still, with no"
1047,"thought of rotating crops, sowed in a dream amidst the harvesting."
1047,""
1047,"There is no fierceness left in the teaching now. Just after I went up"
1047,"to Trinity, Gates, our Head, wrote a review article in defence of our"
1047,"curriculum. In this, among other indiscretions, he asserted that it was"
1047,"impossible to write good English without an illuminating knowledge of"
1047,"the classic tongues, and he split an infinitive and failed to button up"
1047,"a sentence in saying so. His main argument conceded every objection"
1047,"a reasonable person could make to the City Merchants' curriculum. He"
1047,"admitted that translation had now placed all the wisdom of the past at"
1047,"a common man's disposal, that scarcely a field of endeavour remained"
1047,"in which modern work had not long since passed beyond the ancient"
1047,"achievement. He disclaimed any utility. But there was, he said, a"
1047,"peculiar magic in these grammatical exercises no other subjects of"
1047,"instruction possessed. Nothing else provided the same strengthening and"
1047,"orderly discipline for the mind."
1047,""
1047,"He said that, knowing the Senior Classics he did, himself a Senior"
1047,"Classic!"
1047,""
1047,"Yet in a dim confused way I think he was making out a case. In schools"
1047,"as we knew them, and with the sort of assistant available, the sort of"
1047,"assistant who has been trained entirely on the old lines, he could"
1047,"see no other teaching so effectual in developing attention, restraint,"
1047,"sustained constructive effort and various yet systematic adjustment. And"
1047,"that was as far as his imagination could go."
1047,""
1047,"It is infinitely easier to begin organised human affairs than end them;"
1047,"the curriculum and the social organisation of the English public school"
1047,"are the crowning instances of that. They go on because they have begun."
1047,"Schools are not only immortal institutions but reproductive ones. Our"
1047,"founder, Jabez Arvon, knew nothing, I am sure, of Gates' pedagogic"
1047,"values and would, I feel certain, have dealt with them disrespectfully."
1047,"But public schools and university colleges sprang into existence"
1047,"correlated, the scholars went on to the universities and came back to"
1047,"teach the schools, to teach as they themselves had been taught, before"
1047,"they had ever made any real use of the teaching; the crowd of boys"
1047,"herded together, a crowd perpetually renewed and unbrokenly the same,"
1047,"adjusted itself by means of spontaneously developed institutions. In"
1047,"a century, by its very success, this revolutionary innovation of"
1047,"Renascence public schools had become an immense tradition woven closely"
1047,"into the fabric of the national life. Intelligent and powerful people"
1047,"ceased to talk Latin or read Greek, they had got what was wanted, but"
1047,"that only left the schoolmaster the freer to elaborate his point. Since"
1047,"most men of any importance or influence in the country had been through"
1047,"the mill, it was naturally a little difficult to persuade them that"
1047,"it was not quite the best and most ennobling mill the wit of man could"
1047,"devise. And, moreover, they did not want their children made strange to"
1047,"them. There was all the machinery and all the men needed to teach the"
1047,"old subjects, and none to teach whatever new the critic might propose."
1047,"Such science instruction as my father gave seemed indeed the uninviting"
1047,"alternative to the classical grind. It was certainly an altogether"
1047,"inferior instrument at that time."
1047,""
1047,"So it was I occupied my mind with the exact study of dead languages"
1047,"for seven long years. It was the strangest of detachments. We would sit"
1047,"under the desk of such a master as Topham like creatures who had fallen"
1047,"into an enchanted pit, and he would do his considerable best to work us"
1047,"up to enthusiasm for, let us say, a Greek play. If we flagged he would"
1047,"lash himself to revive us. He would walk about the class-room mouthing"
1047,"great lines in a rich roar, and asking us with a flushed face and"
1047,"shining eyes if it was not ""GLORIOUS."" The very sight of Greek letters"
1047,"brings back to me the dingy, faded, ink-splashed quality of our"
1047,"class-room, the banging of books, Topham's disordered hair, the sheen of"
1047,"his alpaca gown, his deep unmusical intonations and the wide striding"
1047,"of his creaking boots. Glorious! And being plastic human beings we would"
1047,"consent that it was glorious, and some of us even achieved an answering"
1047,"reverberation and a sympathetic flush. I at times responded freely. We"
1047,"all accepted from him unquestioningly that these melodies, these strange"
1047,"sounds, exceeded any possibility of beauty that lay in the Gothic"
1047,"intricacy, the splash and glitter, the jar and recovery, the stabbing"
1047,"lights, the heights and broad distances of our English tongue. That"
1047,"indeed was the chief sin of him. It was not that he was for Greek and"
1047,"Latin, but that he was fiercely against every beauty that was neither"
1047,"classic nor deferred to classical canons."
1047,""
1047,"And what exactly did we make of it, we seniors who understood it best?"
1047,"We visualised dimly through that dust and the grammatical difficulties,"
1047,"the spectacle of the chorus chanting grotesquely, helping out"
1047,"protagonist and antagonist, masked and buskined, with the telling of"
1047,"incomprehensible parricides, of inexplicable incest, of gods faded"
1047,"beyond symbolism, of that Relentless Law we did not believe in for a"
1047,"moment, that no modern western European can believe in. We thought"
1047,"of the characters in the unconvincing wigs and costumes of our school"
1047,"performance. No Gilbert Murray had come as yet to touch these things"
1047,"to life again. It was like the ghost of an antiquarian's toy theatre,"
1047,"a ghost that crumbled and condensed into a gritty dust of construing as"
1047,"one looked at it."
1047,""
1047,"Marks, shindies, prayers and punishments, all flavoured with the"
1047,"leathery stuffiness of time-worn Big Hall...."
1047,""
1047,"And then out one would come through our grey old gate into the evening"
1047,"light and the spectacle of London hurrying like a cataract, London in"
1047,"black and brown and blue and gleaming silver, roaring like the very loom"
1047,"of Time. We came out into the new world no teacher has yet had the power"
1047,"and courage to grasp and expound. Life and death sang all about one,"
1047,"joys and fears on such a scale, in such an intricacy as never Greek"
1047,"nor Roman knew. The interminable procession of horse omnibuses went"
1047,"lumbering past, bearing countless people we knew not whence, we knew"
1047,"not whither. Hansoms clattered, foot passengers jostled one, a thousand"
1047,"appeals of shop and boarding caught the eye. The multi-coloured lights"
1047,"of window and street mingled with the warm glow of the declining day"
1047,"under the softly flushing London skies; the ever-changing placards,"
1047,"the shouting news-vendors, told of a kaleidoscopic drama all about the"
1047,"globe. One did not realise what had happened to us, but the voice"
1047,"of Topham was suddenly drowned and lost, he and his minute, remote"
1047,"gesticulations...."
1047,""
1047,"That submerged and isolated curriculum did not even join on to living"
1047,"interests where it might have done so. We were left absolutely to the"
1047,"hints of the newspapers, to casual political speeches, to the cartoons"
1047,"of the comic papers or a chance reading of some Socialist pamphlet for"
1047,"any general ideas whatever about the huge swirling world process"
1047,"in which we found ourselves. I always look back with particular"
1047,"exasperation to the cessation of our modern history at the year 1815."
1047,"There it pulled up abruptly, as though it had come upon something"
1047,"indelicate...."
1047,""
1047,"But, after all, what would Topham or Flack have made of the huge"
1047,"adjustments of the nineteenth century? Flack was the chief cricketer on"
1047,"the staff; he belonged to that great cult which pretends that the place"
1047,"of this or that county in the struggle for the championship is a matter"
1047,"of supreme importance to boys. He obliged us to affect a passionate"
1047,"interest in the progress of county matches, to work up unnatural"
1047,"enthusiasms. What a fuss there would be when some well-trained boy,"
1047,"panting as if from Marathon, appeared with an evening paper! ""I say, you"
1047,"chaps, Middlesex all out for a hundred and five!"""
1047,""
1047,"Under Flack's pressure I became, I confess, a cricket humbug of the"
1047,"first class. I applied myself industriously year by year to mastering"
1047,"scores and averages; I pretended that Lords or the Oval were the places"
1047,"nearest Paradise for me. (I never went to either.) Through a slight"
1047,"mistake about the county boundary I adopted Surrey for my loyalty,"
1047,"though as a matter of fact we were by some five hundred yards or so in"
1047,"Kent. It did quite as well for my purposes. I bowled rather straight and"
1047,"fast, and spent endless hours acquiring the skill to bowl Flack out. He"
1047,"was a bat in the Corinthian style, rich and voluminous, and succumbed"
1047,"very easily to a low shooter or an unexpected Yorker, but usually he was"
1047,"caught early by long leg. The difficulty was to bowl him before he got"
1047,"caught. He loved to lift a ball to leg. After one had clean bowled him"
1047,"at the practice nets one deliberately gave him a ball to leg just to"
1047,"make him feel nice again."
1047,""
1047,"Flack went about a world of marvels dreaming of leg hits. He has been"
1047,"observed, going across the Park on his way to his highly respectable"
1047,"club in Piccadilly, to break from profound musings into a strange brief"
1047,"dance that ended with an imaginary swipe with his umbrella, a roofer,"
1047,"over the trees towards Buckingham Palace. The hit accomplished, Flack"
1047,"resumed his way."
1047,""
1047,"Inadequately instructed foreigners would pass him in terror, needlessly"
1047,"alert."

1047,""
1047,"These schoolmasters move through my memory as always a little distant"
1047,"and more than a little incomprehensible. Except when they wore flannels,"
1047,"I saw them almost always in old college caps and gowns, a uniform which"
1047,"greatly increased their detachment from the world of actual men. Gates,"
1047,"the head, was a lean loose-limbed man, rather stupid I discovered when I"
1047,"reached the Sixth and came into contact with him, but honest, simple"
1047,"and very eager to be liberal-minded. He was bald, with an almost conical"
1047,"baldness, with a grizzled pointed beard, small featured and, under the"
1047,"stresses of a Zeitgeist that demanded liberality, with an expression of"
1047,"puzzled but resolute resistance to his own unalterable opinions. He made"
1047,"a tall dignified figure in his gown. In my junior days he spoke to me"
1047,"only three or four times, and then he annoyed me by giving me a wrong"
1047,"surname; it was a sore point because I was an outsider and not one of"
1047,"the old school families, the Shoesmiths, the Naylors, the Marklows, the"
1047,"Tophams, the Pevises and suchlike, who came generation after generation."
1047,"I recall him most vividly against the background of faded brown"
1047,"book-backs in the old library in which we less destructive seniors were"
1047,"trusted to work, with the light from the stained-glass window falling"
1047,"in coloured patches on his face. It gave him the appearance of having no"
1047,"colour of his own. He had a habit of scratching the beard on his cheek"
1047,"as he talked, and he used to come and consult us about things and"
1047,"invariably do as we said. That, in his phraseology, was ""maintaining the"
1047,"traditions of the school."""
1047,""
1047,"He had indeed an effect not of a man directing a school, but of a"
1047,"man captured and directed by a school. Dead and gone Elizabethans had"
1047,"begotten a monster that could carry him about in its mouth."
1047,""
1047,"Yet being a man, as I say, with his hair a little stirred by a Zeitgeist"
1047,"that made for change, Gates did at times display a disposition towards"
1047,"developments. City Merchants had no modern side, and utilitarian spirits"
1047,"were carping in the PALL MALL GAZETTE and elsewhere at the omissions"
1047,"from our curriculum, and particularly at our want of German. Moreover,"
1047,"four classes still worked together with much clashing and uproar in the"
1047,"old Big Hall that had once held in a common tumult the entire school."
1047,"Gates used to come and talk to us older fellows about these things."
1047,""
1047,"""I don't wish to innovate unduly,"" he used to say. ""But we ought to get"
1047,"in some German, you know,--for those who like it. The army men will be"
1047,"wanting it some of these days."""
1047,""
1047,"He referred to the organisation of regular evening preparation for the"
1047,"lower boys in Big Hall as a ""revolutionary change,"" but he achieved it,"
1047,"and he declared he began the replacement of the hacked wooden tables, at"
1047,"which the boys had worked since Tudor days, by sloping desks with safety"
1047,"inkpots and scientifically adjustable seats, ""with grave misgivings."""
1047,"And though he never birched a boy in his life, and was, I am convinced,"
1047,"morally incapable of such a scuffle, he retained the block and birch in"
1047,"the school through all his term of office, and spoke at the Headmasters'"
1047,"Conference in temperate approval of corporal chastisement, comparing it,"
1047,"dear soul! to the power of the sword...."
1047,""
1047,"I wish I could, in some measure and without tediousness, convey the"
1047,"effect of his discourses to General Assembly in Big Hall. But that"
1047,"is like trying to draw the obverse and reverse of a sixpence worn to"
1047,"complete illegibility. His tall fine figure stood high on the days, his"
1047,"thoughtful tenor filled the air as he steered his hazardous way"
1047,"through sentences that dragged inconclusive tails and dropped redundant"
1047,"prepositions. And he pleaded ever so urgently, ever so finely, that"
1047,"what we all knew for Sin was sinful, and on the whole best avoided"
1047,"altogether, and so went on with deepening notes and even with short"
1047,"arresting gestures of the right arm and hand, to stir and exhort us"
1047,"towards goodness, towards that modern, unsectarian goodness, goodness"
1047,"in general and nothing in particular, which the Zeitgeist seemed to"
1047,"indicate in those transitional years."

1047,""
1047,"The school never quite got hold of me. Partly I think that was because"
1047,"I was a day-boy and so freer than most of the boys, partly because of"
1047,"a temperamental disposition to see things in my own way and have my"
1047,"private dreams, partly because I was a little antagonised by the family"
1047,"traditions that ran through the school. I was made to feel at first"
1047,"that I was a rank outsider, and I never quite forgot it. I suffered very"
1047,"little bullying, and I never had a fight--in all my time there were only"
1047,"three fights--but I followed my own curiosities. I was already a"
1047,"very keen theologian and politician before I was fifteen. I was also"
1047,"intensely interested in modern warfare. I read the morning papers in"
1047,"the Reading Room during the midday recess, never missed the illustrated"
1047,"weeklies, and often when I could afford it I bought a PALL MALL GAZETTE"
1047,"on my way home."
1047,""
1047,"I do not think that I was very exceptional in that; most intelligent"
1047,"boys, I believe, want naturally to be men, and are keenly interested"
1047,"in men's affairs. There is not the universal passion for a magnified"
1047,"puerility among them it is customary to assume. I was indeed a voracious"
1047,"reader of everything but boys' books--which I detested--and fiction. I"
1047,"read histories, travel, popular science and controversy with particular"
1047,"zest, and I loved maps. School work and school games were quite"
1047,"subordinate affairs for me. I worked well and made a passable figure"
1047,"at games, and I do not think I was abnormally insensitive to the fine"
1047,"quality of our school, to the charm of its mediaeval nucleus, its"
1047,"Gothic cloisters, its scraps of Palladian and its dignified Georgian"
1047,"extensions; the contrast of the old quiet, that in spite of our presence"
1047,"pervaded it everywhere, with the rushing and impending London all"
1047,"about it, was indeed a continual pleasure to me. But these things were"
1047,"certainly not the living and central interests of my life."
1047,""
1047,"I had to conceal my wider outlook to a certain extent--from the masters"
1047,"even more than from the boys. Indeed I only let myself go freely with"
1047,"one boy, Britten, my especial chum, the son of the Agent-General for"
1047,"East Australia. We two discovered in a chance conversation A PROPOS of a"
1047,"map in the library that we were both of us curious why there were Malays"
1047,"in Madagascar, and how the Mecca pilgrims came from the East Indies"
1047,"before steamships were available. Neither of us had suspected that"
1047,"there was any one at all in the school who knew or cared a rap about the"
1047,"Indian Ocean, except as water on the way to India. But Britten had come"
1047,"up through the Suez Canal, and his ship had spoken a pilgrim ship on"
1047,"the way. It gave him a startling quality of living knowledge. From these"
1047,"pilgrims we got to a comparative treatment of religions, and from that,"
1047,"by a sudden plunge, to entirely sceptical and disrespectful confessions"
1047,"concerning Gates' last outbreak of simple piety in School Assembly. We"
1047,"became congenial intimates from that hour."
1047,""
1047,"The discovery of Britten happened to me when we were both in the Lower"
1047,"Fifth. Previously there had been a watertight compartment between the"
1047,"books I read and the thoughts they begot on the one hand and human"
1047,"intercourse on the other. Now I really began my higher education, and"
1047,"aired and examined and developed in conversation the doubts, the ideas,"
1047,"the interpretations that had been forming in my mind. As we were both"
1047,"day-boys with a good deal of control over our time we organised walks"
1047,"and expeditions together, and my habit of solitary and rather vague"
1047,"prowling gave way to much more definite joint enterprises. I went"
1047,"several times to his house, he was the youngest of several brothers, one"
1047,"of whom was a medical student and let us assist at the dissection of a"
1047,"cat, and once or twice in vacation time he came to Penge, and we went"
1047,"with parcels of provisions to do a thorough day in the grounds and"
1047,"galleries of the Crystal Palace, ending with the fireworks at close"
1047,"quarters. We went in a river steamboat down to Greenwich, and fired by"
1047,"that made an excursion to Margate and back; we explored London docks"
1047,"and Bethnal Green Museum, Petticoat Lane and all sorts of out-of-the-way"
1047,"places together."
1047,""
1047,"We confessed shyly to one another a common secret vice, ""Phantom"
1047,"warfare."" When we walked alone, especially in the country, we had both"
1047,"developed the same practice of fighting an imaginary battle about us"
1047,"as we walked. As we went along we were generals, and our attacks pushed"
1047,"along on either side, crouching and gathering behind hedges, cresting"
1047,"ridges, occupying copses, rushing open spaces, fighting from house to"
1047,"house. The hillsides about Penge were honeycombed in my imagination with"
1047,"the pits and trenches I had created to check a victorious invader coming"
1047,"out of Surrey. For him West Kensington was chiefly important as the"
1047,"scene of a desperate and successful last stand of insurrectionary troops"
1047,"(who had seized the Navy, the Bank and other advantages) against a"
1047,"royalist army--reinforced by Germans--advancing for reasons best known"
1047,"to themselves by way of Harrow and Ealing. It is a secret and solitary"
1047,"game, as we found when we tried to play it together. We made a success"
1047,"of that only once. All the way down to Margate we schemed defences and"
1047,"assailed and fought them as we came back against the sunset. Afterwards"
1047,"we recapitulated all that conflict by means of a large scale map of the"
1047,"Thames and little paper ironclads in plan cut out of paper."
1047,""
1047,"A subsequent revival of these imaginings was brought about by Britten's"
1047,"luck in getting, through a friend of his father's, admission for us both"
1047,"to the spectacle of volunteer officers fighting the war game in Caxton"
1047,"Hall. We developed a war game of our own at Britten's home with nearly a"
1047,"couple of hundred lead soldiers, some excellent spring cannons that shot"
1047,"hard and true at six yards, hills of books and a constantly elaborated"
1047,"set of rules. For some months that occupied an immense proportion of"
1047,"our leisure. Some of our battles lasted several days. We kept the game a"
1047,"profound secret from the other fellows. They would not have understood."
1047,""
1047,"And we also began, it was certainly before we were sixteen, to write,"
1047,"for the sake of writing. We liked writing. We had discovered Lamb"
1047,"and the best of the middle articles in such weeklies as the SATURDAY"
1047,"GAZETTE, and we imitated them. Our minds were full of dim uncertain"
1047,"things we wanted to drag out into the light of expression. Britten had"
1047,"got hold of IN MEMORIAM, and I had disinterred Pope's ESSAY ON MAN and"
1047,"RABBI BEN EZRA, and these things had set our theological and cosmic"
1047,"solicitudes talking. I was somewhere between sixteen and eighteen,"
1047,"I know, when he and I walked along the Thames Embankment confessing"
1047,"shamefully to one another that we had never read Lucretius. We thought"
1047,"every one who mattered had read Lucretius."
1047,""
1047,"When I was nearly sixteen my mother was taken ill very suddenly,"
1047,"and died of some perplexing complaint that involved a post-mortem"
1047,"examination; it was, I think, the trouble that has since those days"
1047,"been recognised as appendicitis. This led to a considerable change in"
1047,"my circumstances; the house at Penge was given up, and my Staffordshire"
1047,"uncle arranged for me to lodge during school terms with a needy"
1047,"solicitor and his wife in Vicars Street, S. W., about a mile and a half"
1047,"from the school. So it was I came right into London; I had almost two"
1047,"years of London before I went to Cambridge."
1047,""
1047,"Those were our great days together. Afterwards we were torn apart;"
1047,"Britten went to Oxford, and our circumstances never afterwards threw us"
1047,"continuously together until the days of the BLUE WEEKLY."
1047,""
1047,"As boys, we walked together, read and discussed the same books, pursued"
1047,"the same enquiries. We got a reputation as inseparables and the nickname"
1047,"of the Rose and the Lily, for Britten was short and thick-set with"
1047,"dark close curling hair and a ruddy Irish type of face; I was lean and"
1047,"fair-haired and some inches taller than he. Our talk ranged widely and"
1047,"yet had certain very definite limitations. We were amazingly free with"
1047,"politics and religion, we went to that little meeting-house of William"
1047,"Morris's at Hammersmith and worked out the principles of Socialism"
1047,"pretty thoroughly, and we got up the Darwinian theory with the help"
1047,"of Britten's medical-student brother and the galleries of the Natural"
1047,"History Museum in Cromwell Road. Those wonderful cases on the ground"
1047,"floor illustrating mimicry, dimorphism and so forth, were new in our"
1047,"times, and we went through them with earnest industry and tried over our"
1047,"Darwinism in the light of that. Such topics we did exhaustively. But on"
1047,"the other hand I do not remember any discussion whatever of human sex or"
1047,"sexual relationships. There, in spite of intense secret curiosities, our"
1047,"lips were sealed by a peculiar shyness. And I do not believe we ever had"
1047,"occasion either of us to use the word ""love."" It was not only that we"
1047,"were instinctively shy of the subject, but that we were mightily ashamed"
1047,"of the extent of our ignorance and uncertainty in these matters. We"
1047,"evaded them elaborately with an assumption of exhaustive knowledge."
1047,""
1047,"We certainly had no shyness about theology. We marked the emancipation"
1047,"of our spirits from the frightful teachings that had oppressed our"
1047,"boyhood, by much indulgence in blasphemous wit. We had a secret"
1047,"literature of irreverent rhymes, and a secret art of theological"
1047,"caricature. Britten's father had delighted his family by reading aloud"
1047,"from Dr. Richard Garnett's TWILIGHT OF THE GODS, and Britten conveyed"
1047,"the precious volume to me. That and the BAB BALLADS were the inspiration"
1047,"of some of our earliest lucubrations."
1047,""
1047,"For an imaginative boy the first experience of writing is like a tiger's"
1047,"first taste of blood, and our literary flowerings led very directly to"
1047,"the revival of the school magazine, which had been comatose for some"
1047,"years. But there we came upon a disappointment."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"8"
1047,""
1047,"In that revival we associated certain other of the Sixth Form boys,"
1047,"and notably one for whom our enterprise was to lay the foundations of a"
1047,"career that has ended in the House of Lords, Arthur Cossington, now"
1047,"Lord Paddockhurst. Cossington was at that time a rather heavy, rather"
1047,"good-looking boy who was chiefly eminent in cricket, an outsider even as"
1047,"we were and preoccupied no doubt, had we been sufficiently detached to"
1047,"observe him, with private imaginings very much of the same quality"
1047,"and spirit as our own. He was, we were inclined to think, rather a"
1047,"sentimentalist, rather a poseur, he affected a concise emphatic style,"
1047,"played chess very well, betrayed a belief in will-power, and earned"
1047,"Britten's secret hostility, Britten being a sloven, by the invariable"
1047,"neatness of his collars and ties. He came into our magazine with a"
1047,"vigour that we found extremely surprising and unwelcome."
1047,""
1047,"Britten and I had wanted to write. We had indeed figured our project"
1047,"modestly as a manuscript magazine of satirical, liberal and brilliant"
1047,"literature by which in some rather inexplicable way the vague tumult of"
1047,"ideas that teemed within us was to find form and expression; Cossington,"
1047,"it was manifest from the outset, wanted neither to write nor writing,"
1047,"but a magazine. I remember the inaugural meeting in Shoesmith major's"
1047,"study--we had had great trouble in getting it together--and how"
1047,"effectually Cossington bolted with the proposal."
1047,""
1047,"""I think we fellows ought to run a magazine,"" said Cossington. ""The"
1047,"school used to have one. A school like this ought to have a magazine."""
1047,""
1047,"""The last one died in '84,"" said Shoesmith from the hearthrug. ""Called"
1047,"the OBSERVER. Rot rather."""
1047,""
1047,"""Bad title,"" said Cossington."
1047,""
1047,"""There was a TATLER before that,"" said Britten, sitting on the writing"
1047,"table at the window that was closed to deaden the cries of the Lower"
1047,"School at play, and clashing his boots together."
1047,""
1047,"""We want something suggestive of City Merchants."""
1047,""
1047,"""CITY MERCHANDIZE,"" said Britten."
1047,""
1047,"""Too fanciful. What of ARVONIAN? Richard Arvon was our founder, and it"
1047,"seems almost a duty--"""
1047,""
1047,"""They call them all -usians or -onians,"" said Britten."
1047,""
1047,"""I like CITY MERCHANDIZE,"" I said. ""We could probably find a quotation"
1047,"to suggest--oh! mixed good things."""
1047,""
1047,"Cossington regarded me abstractedly."
1047,""
1047,"""Don't want to put the accent on the City, do we?"" said Shoesmith, who"
1047,"had a feeling for county families, and Naylor supported him by a murmur"
1047,"of approval."
1047,""
1047,"""We ought to call it the ARVONIAN,"" decided Cossington, ""and we might"
1047,"very well have underneath, 'With which is incorporated the OBSERVER.'"
1047,"That picks up the old traditions, makes an appeal to old boys and all"
1047,"that, and it gives us something to print under the title."""
1047,""
1047,"I still held out for CITY MERCHANDIZE, which had taken my fancy. ""Some"
1047,"of the chaps' people won't like it,"" said Naylor, ""certain not to. And"
1047,"it sounds Rum."""
1047,""
1047,"""Sounds Weird,"" said a boy who had not hitherto spoken."
1047,""
1047,"""We aren't going to do anything Queer,"" said Shoesmith, pointedly not"
1047,"looking at Britten."
1047,""
1047,"The question of the title had manifestly gone against us. ""Oh! HAVE it"
1047,"ARVONIAN,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""And next, what size shall we have?"" said Cossington."
1047,""
1047,"""Something like MACMILLAN'S MAGAZINE--or LONGMANS'; LONGMANS' is better"
1047,"because it has a whole page, not columns. It makes no end of difference"
1047,"to one's effects."""
1047,""
1047,"""What effects?"" asked Shoesmith abruptly."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh! a pause or a white line or anything. You've got to write closer for"
1047,"a double column. It's nuggetty. You can't get a swing on your prose."" I"
1047,"had discussed this thoroughly with Britten."
1047,""
1047,"""If the fellows are going to write--"" began Britten."
1047,""
1047,"""We ought to keep off fine writing,"" said Shoesmith. ""It's cheek. I vote"
1047,"we don't have any."""
1047,""
1047,"""We sha'n't get any,"" said Cossington, and then as an olive branch to"
1047,"me, ""unless Remington does a bit. Or Britten. But it's no good making"
1047,"too much space for it."""
1047,""
1047,"""We ought to be very careful about the writing,"" said Shoesmith. ""We"
1047,"don't want to give ourselves away."""
1047,""
1047,"""I vote we ask old Topham to see us through,"" said Naylor."
1047,""
1047,"Britten groaned aloud and every one regarded him. ""Greek epigrams on the"
1047,"fellows' names,"" he said. ""Small beer in ancient bottles. Let's get a"
1047,"stuffed broody hen to SIT on the magazine."""
1047,""
1047,"""We might do worse than a Greek epigram,"" said Cossington. ""One in each"
1047,"number. It--it impresses parents and keeps up our classical tradition."
1047,"And the masters CAN help. We don't want to antagonise them. Of"
1047,"course--we've got to departmentalise. Writing is only one section of the"
1047,"thing. The ARVONIAN has to stand for the school. There's questions"
1047,"of space and questions of expense. We can't turn out a great chunk of"
1047,"printed prose like--like wet cold toast and call it a magazine."""
1047,""
1047,"Britten writhed, appreciating the image."
1047,""
1047,"""There's to be a section of sports. YOU must do that."""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm not going to do any fine writing,"" said Shoesmith."
1047,""
1047,"""What you've got to do is just to list all the chaps and put a note to"
1047,"their play:--'Naylor minor must pass more. Football isn't the place for"
1047,"extreme individualism.' 'Ammersham shapes well as half-back.' Things"
1047,"like that."""
1047,""
1047,"""I could do that all right,"" said Shoesmith, brightening and manifestly"
1047,"becoming pregnant with judgments."
1047,""
1047,"""One great thing about a magazine of this sort,"" said Cossington, ""is"
1047,"to mention just as many names as you can in each number. It keeps the"
1047,"interest alive. Chaps will turn it over looking for their own little"
1047,"bit. Then it all lights up for them."""
1047,""
1047,"""Do you want any reports of matches?"" Shoesmith broke from his"
1047,"meditation."
1047,""
1047,"""Rather. With comments."""
1047,""
1047,"""Naylor surpassed himself and negotiated the lemon safely home,"" said"
1047,"Shoesmith."
1047,""
1047,"""Shut it,"" said Naylor modestly."
1047,""
1047,"""Exactly,"" said Cossington. ""That gives us three features,"" touching"
1047,"them off on his fingers, ""Epigram, Literary Section, Sports. Then we"
1047,"want a section to shove anything into, a joke, a notice of anything"
1047,"that's going on. So on. Our Note Book."""
1047,""
1047,"""Oh, Hell!"" said Britten, and clashed his boots, to the silent"
1047,"disapproval of every one."
1047,""
1047,"""Then we want an editorial."""
1047,""
1047,"""A WHAT?"" cried Britten, with a note of real terror in his voice."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, don't we? Unless we have our Note Book to begin on the front"
1047,"page. It gives a scrappy effect to do that. We want something manly and"
1047,"straightforward and a bit thoughtful, about Patriotism, say, or ESPRIT"
1047,"DE CORPS, or After-Life."""
1047,""
1047,"I looked at Britten. Hitherto we had not considered Cossington mattered"
1047,"very much in the world."
1047,""
1047,"He went over us as a motor-car goes over a dog. There was a sort of"
1047,"energy about him, a new sort of energy to us; we had never realised"
1047,"that anything of the sort existed in the world. We were hopelessly at"
1047,"a disadvantage. Almost instantly we had developed a clear and detailed"
1047,"vision of a magazine made up of everything that was most acceptable"
1047,"in the magazines that flourished in the adult world about us, and had"
1047,"determined to make it a success. He had by a kind of instinct, as it"
1047,"were, synthetically plagiarised every successful magazine and breathed"
1047,"into this dusty mixture the breath of life. He was elected at his own"
1047,"suggestion managing director, with the earnest support of Shoesmith and"
1047,"Naylor, and conducted the magazine so successfully and brilliantly that"
1047,"he even got a whole back page of advertisements from the big sports shop"
1047,"in Holborn, and made the printers pay at the same rate for a notice"
1047,"of certain books of their own which they said they had inserted by"
1047,"inadvertency to fill up space. The only literary contribution in the"
1047,"first number was a column by Topham in faultless stereotyped English in"
1047,"depreciation of some fancied evil called Utilitarian Studies and ending"
1047,"with that noble old quotation:--"

1047,""
1047,"And Flack crowded us out of number two with a bright little paper on the"

1047,"CHAPTER THE FOURTH ~~ ADOLESCENCE"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,"I find it very difficult to trace how form was added to form"
1047,"and interpretation followed interpretation in my ever-spreading,"
1047,"ever-deepening, ever-multiplying and enriching vision of this world into"
1047,"which I had been born. Every day added its impressions, its hints, its"
1047,"subtle explications to the growing understanding. Day after day the"
1047,"living interlacing threads of a mind weave together. Every morning now"
1047,"for three weeks and more (for to-day is Thursday and I started on a"
1047,"Tuesday) I have been trying to convey some idea of the factors and"
1047,"early influences by which my particular scrap of subjective tapestry"
1047,"was shaped, to show the child playing on the nursery floor, the son"
1047,"perplexed by his mother, gazing aghast at his dead father, exploring"
1047,"interminable suburbs, touched by first intimations of the sexual"
1047,"mystery, coming in with a sort of confused avidity towards the centres"
1047,"of the life of London. It is only by such an effort to write it down"
1047,"that one realises how marvellously crowded, how marvellously analytical"
1047,"and synthetic those ears must be. One begins with the little child"
1047,"to whom the sky is a roof of blue, the world a screen of opaque and"
1047,"disconnected facts, the home a thing eternal, and ""being good"" just"
1047,"simple obedience to unquestioned authority; and one comes at last to"
1047,"the vast world of one's adult perception, pierced deep by flaring"
1047,"searchlights of partial understanding, here masked by mists, here"
1047,"refracted and distorted through half translucent veils, here showing"
1047,"broad prospects and limitless vistas and here impenetrably dark."
1047,""
1047,"I recall phases of deep speculation, doubts and even prayers by night,"
1047,"and strange occasions when by a sort of hypnotic contemplation of"
1047,"nothingness I sought to pierce the web of appearances about me. It is"
1047,"hard to measure these things in receding perspective, and now I cannot"
1047,"trace, so closely has mood succeeded and overlaid and obliterated mood,"
1047,"the phases by which an utter horror of death was replaced by the growing"
1047,"realisation of its necessity and dignity. Difficulty of the imagination"
1047,"with infinite space, infinite time, entangled my mind; and moral"
1047,"distress for the pain and suffering of bygone ages that made all thought"
1047,"of reformation in the future seem but the grimmest irony upon now"
1047,"irreparable wrongs. Many an intricate perplexity of these broadening"
1047,"years did not so much get settled as cease to matter. Life crowded me"
1047,"away from it."
1047,""
1047,"I have confessed myself a temerarious theologian, and in that"
1047,"passage from boyhood to manhood I ranged widely in my search for some"
1047,"permanently satisfying Truth. That, too, ceased after a time to be"
1047,"urgently interesting. I came at last into a phase that endures to this"
1047,"day, of absolute tranquillity, of absolute confidence in whatever that"
1047,"Incomprehensible Comprehensive which must needs be the substratum of all"
1047,"things, may be. Feeling OF IT, feeling BY IT, I cannot feel afraid of"
1047,"it. I think I had got quite clearly and finally to that adjustment long"
1047,"before my Cambridge days were done. I am sure that the evil in life is"
1047,"transitory and finite like an accident or distress in the nursery; that"
1047,"God is my Father and that I may trust Him, even though life hurts so"
1047,"that one must needs cry out at it, even though it shows no consequence"
1047,"but failure, no promise but pain...."
1047,""
1047,"But while I was fearless of theology I must confess it was comparatively"
1047,"late before I faced and dared to probe the secrecies of sex. I was"
1047,"afraid of sex. I had an instinctive perception that it would be a large"
1047,"and difficult thing in my life, but my early training was all in"
1047,"the direction of regarding it as an irrelevant thing, as something"
1047,"disconnected from all the broad significances of life, as hostile"
1047,"and disgraceful in its quality. The world was never so emasculated in"
1047,"thought, I suppose, as it was in the Victorian time...."
1047,""
1047,"I was afraid to think either of sex or (what I have always found"
1047,"inseparable from a kind of sexual emotion) beauty. Even as a boy I knew"
1047,"the thing as a haunting and alluring mystery that I tried to keep away"
1047,"from. Its dim presence obsessed me none the less for all the extravagant"
1047,"decency, the stimulating silences of my upbringing...."
1047,""
1047,"The plaster Venuses and Apollos that used to adorn the vast aisle and"
1047,"huge grey terraces of the Crystal Palace were the first intimations of"
1047,"the beauty of the body that ever came into my life. As I write of it I"
1047,"feel again the shameful attraction of those gracious forms. I used to"
1047,"look at them not simply, but curiously and askance. Once at least in"
1047,"my later days at Penge, I spent a shilling in admission chiefly for the"
1047,"sake of them...."
1047,""
1047,"The strangest thing of all my odd and solitary upbringing seems to me"
1047,"now that swathing up of all the splendours of the flesh, that strange"
1047,"combination of fanatical terrorism and shyness that fenced me about with"
1047,"prohibitions. It caused me to grow up, I will not say blankly ignorant,"
1047,"but with an ignorance blurred and dishonoured by shame, by enigmatical"
1047,"warnings, by cultivated aversions, an ignorance in which a fascinated"
1047,"curiosity and desire struggled like a thing in a net. I knew so little"
1047,"and I felt so much. There was indeed no Aphrodite at all in my youthful"
1047,"Pantheon, but instead there was a mysterious and minatory gap. I have"
1047,"told how at last a new Venus was born in my imagination out of gas lamps"
1047,"and the twilight, a Venus with a cockney accent and dark eyes shining"
1047,"out of the dusk, a Venus who was a warm, passion-stirring atmosphere"
1047,"rather than incarnate in a body. And I have told, too, how I bought a"
1047,"picture."
1047,""
1047,"All this was a thing apart from the rest of my life, a locked avoided"
1047,"chamber...."
1047,""
1047,"It was not until my last year at Trinity that I really broke down the"
1047,"barriers of this unwholesome silence and brought my secret broodings to"
1047,"the light of day. Then a little set of us plunged suddenly into what"
1047,"we called at first sociological discussion. I can still recall even the"
1047,"physical feeling of those first tentative talks. I remember them mostly"
1047,"as occurring in the rooms of Ted Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by"
1047,"the Trinity great gate, but we also used to talk a good deal at a man's"
1047,"in King's, a man named, if I remember rightly, Redmayne. The atmosphere"
1047,"of Hatherleigh's rooms was a haze of tobacco smoke against a background"
1047,"brown and deep. He professed himself a socialist with anarchistic"
1047,"leanings--he had suffered the martyrdom of ducking for it--and a huge"
1047,"French May-day poster displaying a splendid proletarian in red and black"
1047,"on a barricade against a flaring orange sky, dominated his decorations."
1047,"Hatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all the place, even"
1047,"the floor, was littered with books, for the most part open and face"
1047,"downward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and"
1047,"our caps, all conscientiously battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like an"
1047,"elephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of mine;"
1047,"the highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from his"
1047,"chequered blue mugs full of audit ale. We sat on oak chairs, except the"
1047,"four or five who crowded on a capacious settle, we drank a lot of beer"
1047,"and were often fuddled, and occasionally quite drunk, and we all smoked"
1047,"reckless-looking pipes,--there was a transient fashion among us for corn"
1047,"cobs for which Mark Twain, I think, was responsible. Our little excesses"
1047,"with liquor were due far more to conscience than appetite, indicated"
1047,"chiefly a resolve to break away from restraints that we suspected were"
1047,"keeping us off the instructive knife-edges of life. Hatherleigh was a"
1047,"good Englishman of the premature type with a red face, a lot of hair, a"
1047,"deep voice and an explosive plunging manner, and it was he who said one"
1047,"evening--Heaven knows how we got to it--""Look here, you know, it's all"
1047,"Rot, this Shutting Up about Women. We OUGHT to talk about them. What are"
1047,"we going to do about them? It's got to come. We're all festering inside"
1047,"about it. Let's out with it. There's too much Decency altogether about"
1047,"this Infernal University!"""
1047,""
1047,"We rose to his challenge a little awkwardly and our first talk"
1047,"was clumsy, there were flushed faces and red ears, and I remember"
1047,"Hatherleigh broke out into a monologue on decency. ""Modesty and"
1047,"Decency,"" said Hatherleigh, ""are Oriental vices. The Jews brought them"
1047,"to Europe. They're Semitic, just like our monasticism here and the"
1047,"seclusion of women and mutilating the dead on a battlefield. And all"
1047,"that sort of thing."""
1047,""
1047,"Hatherleigh's mind progressed by huge leaps, leaps that were usually"
1047,"wildly inaccurate, and for a time we engaged hotly upon the topic of"
1047,"those alleged mutilations and the Semitic responsibility for decency."
1047,"Hatherleigh tried hard to saddle the Semitic race with the less elegant"
1047,"war customs of the Soudan and the northwest frontier of India, and"
1047,"quoted Doughty, at that time a little-known author, and Cunninghame"
1047,"Graham to show that the Arab was worse than a county-town spinster in"
1047,"his regard for respectability. But his case was too preposterous, and"
1047,"Esmeer, with his shrill penetrating voice and his way of pointing with"
1047,"all four long fingers flat together, carried the point against him. He"
1047,"quoted Cato and Roman law and the monasteries of Thibet."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, anyway,"" said Hatherleigh, escaping from our hands like an"
1047,"intellectual frog, ""Semitic or not, I've got no use for decency."""
1047,""
1047,"We argued points and Hatherleigh professed an unusually balanced and"
1047,"tolerating attitude. ""I don't mind a certain refinement and dignity,"" he"
1047,"admitted generously. ""What I object to is this spreading out of decency"
1047,"until it darkens the whole sky, until it makes a man's father afraid to"
1047,"speak of the most important things, until it makes a man afraid to look"
1047,"a frank book in the face or think--even think! until it leads to our"
1047,"coming to--to the business at last with nothing but a few prohibitions,"
1047,"a few hints, a lot of dirty jokes and, and ""--he waved a hand and seemed"
1047,"to seek and catch his image in the air--""oh, a confounded buttered slide"
1047,"of sentiment, to guide us. I tell you I'm going to think about it and"
1047,"talk about it until I see a little more daylight than I do at present."
1047,"I'm twenty-two. Things might happen to me anywhen. You men can go out"
1047,"into the world if you like, to sin like fools and marry like fools,"
1047,"not knowing what you are doing and ashamed to ask. You'll take"
1047,"the consequences, too, I expect, pretty meekly, sniggering a bit,"
1047,"sentimentalising a bit, like--like Cambridge humorists.... I mean to"
1047,"know what I'm doing."""
1047,""
1047,"He paused to drink, and I think I cut in with ideas of my own. But one"
1047,"is apt to forget one's own share in a talk, I find, more than one does"
1047,"the clear-cut objectivity of other people's, and I do not know how far"
1047,"I contributed to this discussion that followed. I am, however, pretty"
1047,"certain that it was then that ideal that we were pleased to call"
1047,"aristocracy and which soon became the common property of our set was"
1047,"developed. It was Esmeer, I know, who laid down and maintained the"
1047,"proposition that so far as minds went there were really only two sorts"
1047,"of man in the world, the aristocrat and the man who subdues his mind to"
1047,"other people's."
1047,""
1047,"""'I couldn't THINK of it, Sir,'"" said Esmeer in his elucidatory tones;"
1047,"""that's what a servant says. His mind even is broken in to run between"
1047,"fences, and he admits it. WE'VE got to be able to think of anything."
1047,"And 'such things aren't for the Likes of Us!' That's another servant's"
1047,"saying. Well, everything IS for the Likes of Us. If we see fit, that"
1047,"is."""
1047,""
1047,"A small fresh-coloured man in grey objected."
1047,""
1047,"""Well,"" exploded Hatherleigh, ""if that isn't so what the deuce are we"
1047,"up here for? Instead of working in mines? If some things aren't to be"
1047,"thought about ever! We've got the privilege of all these extra years for"
1047,"getting things straight in our heads, and then we won't use 'em. Good"
1047,"God! what do you think a university's for?""..."
1047,""
1047,"Esmeer's idea came with an effect of real emancipation to several of"
1047,"us. We were not going to be afraid of ideas any longer, we were going"
1047,"to throw down every barrier of prohibition and take them in and see what"
1047,"came of it. We became for a time even intemperately experimental, and"
1047,"one of us, at the bare suggestion of an eminent psychic investigator,"
1047,"took hashish and very nearly died of it within a fortnight of our great"
1047,"elucidation."
1047,""
1047,"The chief matter of our interchanges was of course the discussion"
1047,"of sex. Once the theme had been opened it became a sore place in"
1047,"our intercourse; none of us seemed able to keep away from it. Our"
1047,"imaginations got astir with it. We made up for lost time and went"
1047,"round it and through it and over it exhaustively. I recall prolonged"
1047,"discussion of polygamy on the way to Royston, muddy November tramps to"
1047,"Madingley, when amidst much profanity from Hatherleigh at the serious"
1047,"treatment of so obsolete a matter, we weighed the reasons, if any, for"
1047,"the institution of marriage. The fine dim night-time spaces of the Great"
1047,"Court are bound up with the inconclusive finales of mighty hot-eared"
1047,"wrangles; the narrows of Trinity Street and Petty Cury and Market Hill"
1047,"have their particular associations for me with that spate of confession"
1047,"and free speech, that almost painful goal delivery of long pent and"
1047,"crappled and sometimes crippled ideas."
1047,""
1047,"And we went on a reading party that Easter to a place called Pulborough"
1047,"in Sussex, where there is a fishing inn and a river that goes under a"
1047,"bridge. It was a late Easter and a blazing one, and we boated and bathed"
1047,"and talked of being Hellenic and the beauty of the body until at moments"
1047,"it seemed to us that we were destined to restore the Golden Age, by the"
1047,"simple abolition of tailors and outfitters."
1047,""
1047,"Those undergraduate talks! how rich and glorious they seemed, how"
1047,"splendidly new the ideas that grew and multiplied in our seething minds!"
1047,"We made long afternoon and evening raids over the Downs towards Arundel,"
1047,"and would come tramping back through the still keen moonlight singing"
1047,"and shouting. We formed romantic friendships with one another, and"
1047,"grieved more or less convincingly that there were no splendid women fit"
1047,"to be our companions in the world. But Hatherleigh, it seemed, had once"
1047,"known a girl whose hair was gloriously red. ""My God!"" said Hatherleigh"
1047,"to convey the quality of her; just simply and with projectile violence:"
1047,"""My God!"""
1047,""
1047,"Benton had heard of a woman who lived with a man refusing to be married"
1047,"to him--we thought that splendid beyond measure,--I cannot now imagine"
1047,"why. She was ""like a tender goddess,"" Benton said. A sort of shame"
1047,"came upon us in the dark in spite of our liberal intentions when Benton"
1047,"committed himself to that. And after such talk we would fall upon great"
1047,"pauses of emotional dreaming, and if by chance we passed a girl in a"
1047,"governess cart, or some farmer's daughter walking to the station, we"
1047,"became alertly silent or obstreperously indifferent to her. For might"
1047,"she not be just that one exception to the banal decency, the sickly"
1047,"pointless conventionality, the sham modesty of the times in which we"
1047,"lived?"
1047,""
1047,"We felt we stood for a new movement, not realising how perennially this"
1047,"same emancipation returns to those ancient courts beside the Cam."
1047,"We were the anti-decency party, we discovered a catch phrase that we"
1047,"flourished about in the Union and made our watchword, namely, ""stark"
1047,"fact."" We hung nude pictures in our rooms much as if they had been"
1047,"flags, to the earnest concern of our bedders, and I disinterred my"
1047,"long-kept engraving and had it framed in fumed oak, and found for it a"
1047,"completer and less restrained companion, a companion I never cared for"
1047,"in the slightest degree...."
1047,""
1047,"This efflorescence did not prevent, I think indeed it rather helped, our"
1047,"more formal university work, for most of us took firsts, and three of"
1047,"us got Fellowships in one year or another. There was Benton who had a"
1047,"Research Fellowship and went to Tubingen, there was Esmeer and myself"
1047,"who both became Residential Fellows. I had taken the Mental and"
1047,"Moral Science Tripos (as it was then), and three years later I got a"
1047,"lectureship in political science. In those days it was disguised in the"
1047,"cloak of Political Economy."

1047,"It was our affectation to be a little detached from the main stream of"
1047,"undergraduate life. We worked pretty hard, but by virtue of our"
1047,"beer, our socialism and suchlike heterodoxy, held ourselves to be"
1047,"differentiated from the swatting reading man. None of us, except Baxter,"
1047,"who was a rowing blue, a rather abnormal blue with an appetite for"
1047,"ideas, took games seriously enough to train, and on the other hand"
1047,"we intimated contempt for the rather mediocre, deliberately humorous,"
1047,"consciously gentlemanly and consciously wild undergraduate men who"
1047,"made up the mass of Cambridge life. After the manner of youth we were"
1047,"altogether too hard on our contemporaries. We battered our caps and"
1047,"tore our gowns lest they should seem new, and we despised these others"
1047,"extremely for doing exactly the same things; we had an idea of ourselves"
1047,"and resented beyond measure a similar weakness in these our brothers."
1047,""
1047,"There was a type, or at least there seemed to us to be a type--I'm a"
1047,"little doubtful at times now whether after all we didn't create it--for"
1047,"which Hatherleigh invented the nickname the ""Pinky Dinkys,"" intending"
1047,"thereby both contempt and abhorrence in almost equal measure. The Pinky"
1047,"Dinky summarised all that we particularly did not want to be, and also,"
1047,"I now perceive, much of what we were and all that we secretly dreaded"
1047,"becoming."
1047,""
1047,"But it is hard to convey the Pinky Dinky idea, for all that it meant so"
1047,"much to us. We spent one evening at least during that reading party upon"
1047,"the Pinky Dinky; we sat about our one fire after a walk in the"
1047,"rain--it was our only wet day--smoked our excessively virile pipes, and"
1047,"elaborated the natural history of the Pinky Dinky. We improvised a"
1047,"sort of Pinky Dinky litany, and Hatherleigh supplied deep notes for the"
1047,"responses."

1047,"meant to get to work upon this whatever office I was given in the new"

1047,"War Office quite as easily as from the Education Office. I am firmly"

1047,"and universities to meet the needs of a modern state, they send their"
1047,"roots too deep and far, the cost would exceed any good that could"
1047,"possibly be effected, and so I have sought a way round this invincible"
1047,"obstacle. I do think it would be quite practicable to side-track, as the"
1047,"Americans say, the whole system by creating hardworking, hard-living,"
1047,"modern and scientific boys' schools, first for the Royal Navy and then"
1047,"for the public service generally, and as they grew, opening them to"
1047,"the public without any absolute obligation to subsequent service."

1047,"the Oxford and Cambridge tradition altogether. I had men in my mind to"
1047,"begin the work, and I should have found others. I should have aimed at"
1047,"making a hard-trained, capable, intellectually active, proud type of"
1047,"man. Everything else would have been made subservient to that. I should"
1047,"have kept my grip on the men through their vacation, and somehow or"
1047,"other I would have contrived a young woman to match them. I think I"

1047,"Tom fashion I did, and that they realised quite early in life that"
1047,"it isn't really virile to reek of tobacco. I should have had military"
1047,"manoeuvres, training ships, aeroplane work, mountaineering and so forth,"
1047,"in the place of the solemn trivialities of games, and I should have fed"

1047,"had he been outside the bars. His utmost travel had been to lecture here"
1047,"and lecture there. His student phase had culminated in papers of quite"
1047,"exceptional brilliance, and he had gone on to lecture with a cheerful"
1047,"combination of wit and mannerism that had made him a success from the"
1047,"beginning. He has lectured ever since. He lectures still. Year by year"
1047,"he has become plumper, more rubicund and more and more of an item for"
1047,"the intelligent visitor to see. Even in my time he was pointed out to"
1047,"people as part of our innumerable enrichments, and obviously he knew it."

1047,"He boasted he took no exercise, and also of his knowledge of port wine."

1047,"Beyond these things he had little pride except that he claimed to have"
1047,"read every novel by a woman writer that had ever entered the Union"
1047,"Library. This, however, he held to be remarkable rather than ennobling,"
1047,"and such boasts as he made of it were tinged with playfulness. Certainly"
1047,"he had a scholar's knowledge of the works of Miss Marie Corelli, Miss"
1047,"Braddon, Miss Elizabeth Glyn and Madame Sarah Grand that would have"
1047,"astonished and flattered those ladies enormously, and he loved nothing"
1047,"so much in his hours of relaxation as to propound and answer difficult"
1047,"questions upon their books. Tusher of King's was his ineffectual rival"
1047,"in this field, their bouts were memorable and rarely other than glorious"
1047,"for Codger; but then Tusher spread himself too much, he also undertook"
1047,"to rehearse whole pages out of Bradshaw, and tell you with all the"

1047,"was a wonderful web he spun out of that queer big active childish brain"

1047,"I have tried to show how, quite early in my life, the fact of"
1047,"disorderliness, the conception of social life as being a multitudinous"
1047,"confusion out of hand, came to me. One always of course simplifies these"
1047,"things in the telling, but I do not think I ever saw the world at large"
1047,"in any other terms. I never at any stage entertained the idea"
1047,"which sustained my mother, and which sustains so many people in the"
1047,"world,--the idea that the universe, whatever superficial discords it"
1047,"may present, is as a matter of fact ""all right,"" is being steered to"
1047,"definite ends by a serene and unquestionable God. My mother thought that"
1047,"Order prevailed, and that disorder was just incidental and foredoomed"
1047,"rebellion; I feel and have always felt that order rebels against and"
1047,"struggles against disorder, that order has an up-hill job, in gardens,"
1047,"experiments, suburbs, everything alike; from the very beginnings of my"
1047,"experience I discovered hostility to order, a constant escaping from"
1047,"control."

1047,"The attempts to rehabilitate Faith in the form of the Individualist's"

1047,"him. I remember as early as the City Merchants' days how Britten and I"
1047,"scoffed at that pompous question-begging word ""Evolution,"" having, so to"
1047,"speak, found it out. Evolution, some illuminating talker had remarked at"
1047,"the Britten lunch table, had led not only to man, but to the liver-fluke"
1047,"and skunk, obviously it might lead anywhere; order came into things only"
1047,"through the struggling mind of man. That lit things wonderfully for"
1047,"us. When I went up to Cambridge I was perfectly clear that life was"
1047,"a various and splendid disorder of forces that the spirit of man sets"
1047,"itself to tame. I have never since fallen away from that persuasion."

1047,"I do not think I was exceptionally precocious in reaching these"
1047,"conclusions and a sort of religious finality for myself by eighteen or"
1047,"nineteen. I know men and women vary very much in these matters, just as"
1047,"children do in learning to talk. Some will chatter at eighteen months"
1047,"and some will hardly speak until three, and the thing has very little"
1047,"to do with their subsequent mental quality. So it is with young people;"
1047,"some will begin their religious, their social, their sexual interests at"
1047,"fourteen, some not until far on in the twenties. Britten and I belonged"
1047,"to one of the precocious types, and Cossington very probably to another."

1047,"there; the real and present world, that is to say, as distinguished from"
1047,"the wonder-lands of atomic and microscopic science and the stars and"
1047,"future time. I had travelled scarcely at all, I had never crossed the"
1047,"Channel, but I had read copiously and I had formed a very good working"
1047,"idea of this round globe with its mountains and wildernesses and forests"
1047,"and all the sorts and conditions of human life that were scattered over"

1047,"In 1895--that was my last year with Britten, for I went up to Cambridge"
1047,"in September--my vision of the world had much the same relation to the"
1047,"vision I have to-day that an ill-drawn daub of a mask has to the direct"
1047,"vision of a human face. Britten and I looked at our world and saw--what"
1047,"did we see? Forms and colours side by side that we had no suspicion were"
1047,"interdependent. We had no conception of the roots of things nor of the"
1047,"reaction of things. It did not seem to us, for example, that business"
1047,"had anything to do with government, or that money and means affected the"
1047,"heroic issues of war. There were no wagons in our war game, and where"
1047,"there were guns, there it was assumed the ammunition was gathered"
1047,"together. Finance again was a sealed book to us; we did not so much"
1047,"connect it with the broad aspects of human affairs as regard it as a"
1047,"sort of intrusive nuisance to be earnestly ignored by all right-minded"
1047,"men. We had no conception of the quality of politics, nor how"
1047,"""interests"" came into such affairs; we believed men were swayed by"
1047,"purely intellectual convictions and were either right or wrong, honest"
1047,"or dishonest (in which case they deserved to be shot), good or bad. We"
1047,"knew nothing of mental inertia, and could imagine the opinion of a whole"
1047,"nation changed by one lucid and convincing exposition. We were capable"
1047,"of the most incongruous transfers from the scroll of history to our own"
1047,"times, we could suppose Brixton ravaged and Hampstead burnt in civil"
1047,"wars for the succession to the throne, or Cheapside a lane of death and"
1047,"the front of the Mansion House set about with guillotines in the course"
1047,"of an accurately transposed French Revolution. We rebuilt London by Act"
1047,"of Parliament, and once in a mood of hygienic enterprise we transferred"
1047,"its population EN MASSE to the North Downs by an order of the Local"
1047,"Government Board. We thought nothing of throwing religious organisations"
1047,"out of employment or superseding all the newspapers by freely"
1047,"distributed bulletins. We could contemplate the possibility of laws"
1047,"abolishing whole classes; we were equal to such a dream as the peaceful"
1047,"and orderly proclamation of Communism from the steps of St. Paul's"
1047,"Cathedral, after the passing of a simply worded bill,--a close and not"
1047,"unnaturally an exciting division carrying the third reading. I remember"
1047,"quite distinctly evolving that vision. We were then fully fifteen and we"
1047,"were perfectly serious about it. We were not fools; it was simply that"
1047,"as yet we had gathered no experience at all of the limits and powers of"
1047,"legislation and conscious collective intention...."

1047,"I think this statement does my boyhood justice, and yet I have my"
1047,"doubts. It is so hard now to say what one understood and what one did"

1047,"outlook, but also that a boy fluctuates between phases of quite adult"
1047,"understanding and phases of tawdrily magnificent puerility. Sometimes"
1047,"I myself was in those tumbrils that went along Cheapside to the Mansion"

1047,"it was I who sat judging and condemning and ruling (sleeping in"
1047,"my clothes and feeding very simply) the soul and autocrat of the"
1047,"Provisional Government, which occupied, of all inconvenient places! the"

1047,"I cannot trace the development of my ideas at Cambridge, but I believe"

1047,"At Cambridge my ideas ceased to live in a duologue; in exchange for"
1047,"Britten, with whom, however, I corresponded lengthily, stylishly and"
1047,"self-consciously for some years, I had now a set of congenial friends. I"
1047,"got talk with some of the younger dons, I learnt to speak in the Union,"
1047,"and in my little set we were all pretty busily sharpening each other's"
1047,"wits and correcting each other's interpretations. Cambridge made"
1047,"politics personal and actual. At City Merchants' we had had no sense"
1047,"of effective contact; we boasted, it is true, an under secretary and a"
1047,"colonial governor among our old boys, but they were never real to"
1047,"us; such distinguished sons as returned to visit the old school were"
1047,"allusive and pleasant in the best Pinky Dinky style, and pretended to"
1047,"be in earnest about nothing but our football and cricket, to mourn the"
1047,"abolition of ""water,"" and find a shuddering personal interest in the"
1047,"ancient swishing block. At Cambridge I felt for the first time that I"
1047,"touched the thing that was going on. Real living statesmen came down to"
1047,"debate in the Union, the older dons had been their college intimates,"
1047,"their sons and nephews expounded them to us and made them real to us."
1047,"They invited us to entertain ideas; I found myself for the first time"
1047,"in my life expected to read and think and discuss, my secret vice had"
1047,"become a virtue."
1047,""
1047,"That combination-room world is at last larger and more populous and"
1047,"various than the world of schoolmasters. The Shoesmiths and Naylors who"
1047,"had been the aristocracy of City Merchants' fell into their place in my"
1047,"mind; they became an undistinguished mass on the more athletic side of"
1047,"Pinky Dinkyism, and their hostility to ideas and to the expression"
1047,"of ideas ceased to limit and trouble me. The brighter men of each"
1047,"generation stay up; these others go down to propagate their tradition,"
1047,"as the fathers of families, as mediocre professional men, as assistant"
1047,"masters in schools. Cambridge which perfects them is by the nature"

1047,"Combination Rooms were full of personal gossip about him and Disraeli"
1047,"and the other big figures of the gladiatorial stage of Parlimentary"
1047,"history, talk that leaked copiously into such sets as mine. The ceiling"
1047,"of our guest chamber at Trinity was glorious with the arms of Sir"
1047,"William Harcourt, whose Death Duties had seemed at first like a"
1047,"socialist dawn. Mr. Evesham we asked to come to the Union every year,"
1047,"Masters, Chamberlain and the old Duke of Devonshire; they did not come"
1047,"indeed, but their polite refusals brought us all, as it were, within"
1047,"personal touch of them. One heard of cabinet councils and meetings at"
1047,"country houses. Some of us, pursuing such interests, went so far as to"
1047,"read political memoirs and the novels of Disraeli and Mrs. Humphry Ward."

1047,"I do not know now whether it was during my school-days or at Cambridge"
1047,"that I first began not merely to see the world as a great contrast of"
1047,"rich and poor, but to feel the massive effect of that multitudinous"
1047,"majority of people who toil continually, who are for ever anxious about"
1047,"ways and means, who are restricted, ill clothed, ill fed and ill"
1047,"housed, who have limited outlooks and continually suffer misadventures,"
1047,"hardships and distresses through the want of money. My lot had fallen"
1047,"upon the fringe of the possessing minority; if I did not know the want"
1047,"of necessities I knew shabbiness, and the world that let me go on to a"
1047,"university education intimated very plainly that there was not a thing"
1047,"beyond the primary needs that my stimulated imagination might demand"
1047,"that it would not be an effort for me to secure. A certain aggressive"
1047,"radicalism against the ruling and propertied classes followed almost"
1047,"naturally from my circumstances. It did not at first connect itself at"
1047,"all with the perception of a planless disorder in human affairs that had"
1047,"been forced upon me by the atmosphere of my upbringing, nor did it link"
1047,"me in sympathy with any of the profounder realities of poverty. It was"
1047,"a personal independent thing. The dingier people one saw in the back"
1047,"streets and lower quarters of Bromstead and Penge, the drift of dirty"
1047,"children, ragged old women, street loafers, grimy workers that made"
1047,"the social background of London, the stories one heard of privation and"
1047,"sweating, only joined up very slowly with the general propositions I was"

1047,"a garrulous old thing with a dusty black bonnet over one eye and an"
1047,"ostentatiously clean apron outside the dark mysteries that clothed her,"

1047,"my uncle and guardian; I walked about and saw Bursley Wakes and much of"
1047,"the human aspects of organised industrialism at close quarters for the"
1047,"first time. The picture of a splendid Working Man cheated out of his"
1047,"innate glorious possibilities, and presently to arise and dash this"
1047,"scoundrelly and scandalous system of private ownership to fragments,"
1047,"began to give place to a limitless spectacle of inefficiency, to a"

1047,"Chris Robinson went and spoke at Bennett Hall in Newnham College, and"
1047,"left Cambridge in the evening amidst the cheers of twenty men or so."
1047,"Socialism was at such a low ebb politically in those days that it didn't"
1047,"even rouse men to opposition."
1047,""
1047,"And there sat Chris under that flamboyant and heroic Worker of the"
1047,"poster, a little wrinkled grey-bearded apologetic man in ready-made"
1047,"clothes, with watchful innocent brown eyes and a persistent and"
1047,"invincible air of being out of his element. He sat with his stout boots"
1047,"tucked up under his chair, and clung to a teacup and saucer and"
1047,"looked away from us into the fire, and we all sat about on tables and"
1047,"chair-arms and windowsills and boxes and anywhere except upon chairs"
1047,"after the manner of young men. The only other chair whose seat was"
1047,"occupied was the one containing his knitted woollen comforter and his"
1047,"picturesque old beach-photographer's hat. We were all shy and didn't"
1047,"know how to take hold of him now we had got him, and, which was"
1047,"disconcertingly unanticipated, he was manifestly having the same"
1047,"difficulty with us. We had expected to be gripped."
1047,""
1047,"""I'll not be knowing what to say to these Chaps,"" he repeated with a"
1047,"north-country quality in his speech."
1047,""
1047,"We made reassuring noises."
1047,""
1047,"The Ambassador of the Workers stirred his tea earnestly through an"
1047,"uncomfortable pause."
1047,""
1047,"""I'd best tell 'em something of how things are in Lancashire, what"
1047,"with the new machines and all that,"" he speculated at last with red"
1047,"reflections in his thoughtful eyes."
1047,""
1047,"We had an inexcusable dread that perhaps he would make a mess of the"
1047,"meeting."
1047,""
1047,"But when he was no longer in the unaccustomed meshes of refined"
1047,"conversation, but speaking with an audience before him, he became a"
1047,"different man. He declared he would explain to us just exactly what"
1047,"socialism was, and went on at once to an impassioned contrast of social"
1047,"conditions. ""You young men,"" he said ""come from homes of luxury; every"
1047,"need you feel is supplied--"""
1047,""
1047,"We sat and stood and sprawled about him, occupying every inch of"
1047,"Redmayne's floor space except the hearthrug-platform, and we listened"
1047,"to him and thought him over. He was the voice of wrongs that made us"
1047,"indignant and eager. We forgot for a time that he had been shy and"
1047,"seemed not a little incompetent, his provincial accent became a beauty"
1047,"of his earnest speech, we were carried away by his indignations. We"
1047,"looked with shining eyes at one another and at the various dons who had"
1047,"dropped in and were striving to maintain a front of judicious severity."
1047,"We felt more and more that social injustice must cease, and cease"
1047,"forthwith. We felt we could not sleep upon it. At the end we clapped and"
1047,"murmured our applause and wanted badly to cheer."
1047,""
1047,"Then like a lancet stuck into a bladder came the heckling. Denson, that"
1047,"indolent, liberal-minded sceptic, did most of the questioning. He lay"
1047,"contorted in a chair, with his ugly head very low, his legs crossed and"
1047,"his left boot very high, and he pointed his remarks with a long thin"
1047,"hand and occasionally adjusted the unstable glasses that hid his watery"
1047,"eyes. ""I don't want to carp,"" he began. ""The present system, I admit,"
1047,"stands condemned. Every present system always HAS stood condemned in the"
1047,"minds of intelligent men. But where it seems to me you get thin, is just"
1047,"where everybody has been thin, and that's when you come to the remedy."""
1047,""
1047,"""Socialism,"" said Chris Robinson, as if it answered everything, and"
1047,"Hatherleigh said ""Hear! Hear!"" very resolutely."
1047,""
1047,"""I suppose I OUGHT to take that as an answer,"" said Denson, getting"
1047,"his shoulder-blades well down to the seat of his chair; ""but I don't."
1047,"I don't, you know. It's rather a shame to cross-examine you after this"
1047,"fine address of yours""--Chris Robinson on the hearthrug made acquiescent"
1047,"and inviting noises--""but the real question remains how exactly are you"
1047,"going to end all these wrongs? There are the administrative questions."
1047,"If you abolish the private owner, I admit you abolish a very complex"
1047,"and clumsy way of getting businesses run, land controlled and things"
1047,"in general administered, but you don't get rid of the need of"
1047,"administration, you know."""
1047,""
1047,"""Democracy,"" said Chris Robinson."
1047,""
1047,"""Organised somehow,"" said Denson. ""And it's just the How perplexes me."
1047,"I can quite easily imagine a socialist state administered in a sort of"
1047,"scrambling tumult that would be worse than anything we have got now."
1047,""
1047,"""Nothing could be worse than things are now,"" said Chris Robinson. ""I"
1047,"have seen little children--"""
1047,""
1047,"""I submit life on an ill-provisioned raft, for example, could easily be"
1047,"worse--or life in a beleagured town."""

1047,"Murmurs."
1047,""
1047,"They wrangled for some time, and it had the effect upon me of coming out"
1047,"from the glow of a good matinee performance into the cold daylight of"
1047,"late afternoon. Chris Robinson did not shine in conflict with Denson; he"
1047,"was an orator and not a dialectician, and he missed Denson's points and"
1047,"displayed a disposition to plunge into untimely pathos and indignation."
1047,"And Denson hit me curiously hard with one of his shafts. ""Suppose,"" he"
1047,"said, ""you found yourself prime minister--"""
1047,""
1047,"I looked at Chris Robinson, bright-eyed and his hair a little ruffled"
1047,"and his whole being rhetorical, and measured him against the huge"
1047,"machine of government muddled and mysterious. Oh! but I was perplexed!"
1047,""
1047,"And then we took him back to Hatherleigh's rooms and drank beer and"
1047,"smoked about him while he nursed his knee with hairy wristed hands that"
1047,"protruded from his flannel shirt, and drank lemonade under the cartoon"
1047,"of that emancipated Worker, and we had a great discursive talk with him."
1047,""
1047,"""Eh! you should see our big meetings up north?"" he said."
1047,""
1047,"Denson had ruffled him and worried him a good deal, and ever and again"
1047,"he came back to that discussion. ""It's all very easy for your learned"
1047,"men to sit and pick holes,"" he said, ""while the children suffer and die."
1047,"They don't pick holes up north. They mean business."""
1047,""
1047,"He talked, and that was the most interesting part of it all, of his"
1047,"going to work in a factory when he was twelve--""when you Chaps were all"
1047,"with your mammies ""--and how he had educated himself of nights until he"
1047,"would fall asleep at his reading."
1047,""
1047,"""It's made many of us keen for all our lives,"" he remarked, ""all that"
1047,"clemming for education. Why! I longed all through one winter to read a"
1047,"bit of Darwin. I must know about this Darwin if I die for it, I said."
1047,"And I could no' get the book."""
1047,""
1047,"Hatherleigh made an enthusiastic noise and drank beer at him with round"
1047,"eyes over the mug."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, anyhow I wasted no time on Greek and Latin,"" said Chris Robinson."
1047,"""And one learns to go straight at a thing without splitting straws. One"
1047,"gets hold of the Elementals."""
1047,""
1047,"(Well, did they? That was the gist of my perplexity.)"
1047,""
1047,"""One doesn't quibble,"" he said, returning to his rankling memory of"
1047,"Denson, ""while men decay and starve."""

1047,"""But suppose,"" I said, suddenly dropping into opposition, ""the"
1047,"alternative is to risk a worse disaster--or do something patently"

1047,"It is a little difficult now to get back to the feelings of that"

1047,"criticised and torn to shreds;--never was a man so violently exalted and"
1047,"then, himself assisting, so relentlessly called down. But in the middle"

1047,"discovery of machinery and cotton waste and the under officer and the"
1047,"engineer, and ""shop"" as a poetic dialect, became almost a national"

1047,"haunting quotations, he stirred Britten and myself to futile imitations,"

1047,"A book that stands out among these memories, that stimulated me"

1047,"OUR CONQUERORS. It is one of the books that have made me. In that I got"
1047,"a supplement and corrective of Kipling. It was the first detached and"
1047,"adverse criticism of the Englishman I had ever encountered. It must have"
1047,"been published already nine or ten years when I read it. The country"
1047,"had paid no heed to it, had gone on to the expensive lessons of the War"
1047,"because of the dull aversion our people feel for all such intimations,"
1047,"and so I could read it as a book justified. The war endorsed its every"
1047,"word for me, underlined each warning indication of the gigantic dangers"

1047,"disciplined while we slouched, aggressive and preparing to bring our"
1047,"Imperial pride to a reckoning, was extremely novel and distasteful to"
1047,"me. It set me worrying of nights. It put all my projects for social and"
1047,"political reconstruction upon a new uncomfortable footing. It made them"
1047,"no longer merely desirable but urgent. Instead of pride and the love"
1047,"of making one might own to a baser motive. Under Kipling's sway I had a"
1047,"little forgotten the continent of Europe, treated it as a mere envious"

1047,"the story of Victor Radnor's fight with society to vindicate the woman"

1047,"full of bitter enlightenment, I can do Meredith justice, and admit the"
1047,"conflict was not only essential but cardinal in his picture, that the"
1047,"terrible inflexibility of the rich aunts and the still more terrible"
1047,"claim of Mrs. Burman Radnor, the ""infernal punctilio,"" and Dudley"
1047,"Sowerby's limitations, were the central substance of that inalertness"

1047,"Next morning we were breathing a thin exhilarating air that seemed to"
1047,"have washed our very veins to an incredible cleanliness, and"
1047,"eating hard-boiled eggs in a vast clear space of rime-edged rocks,"
1047,"snow-mottled, above a blue-gashed glacier. All about us the monstrous"
1047,"rock surfaces rose towards the shining peaks above, and there were"
1047,"winding moraines from which the ice had receded, and then dark"
1047,"clustering fir trees far below."

1047,"saw from the shoulder of the mountain above the Gemmi, and the early"
1047,"summer dawn breaking over Italy as we moved from our night's crouching"
1047,"and munched bread and chocolate and stretched our stiff limbs among the"
1047,"tumbled and precipitous rocks that hung over Lake Cingolo, and surveyed"
1047,"the winding tiring rocky track going down and down to Antronapiano."
1047,""
1047,"And our thoughts were as comprehensive as our impressions. Willersley's"
1047,"mind abounded in historical matter; he had an inaccurate abundant habit"
1047,"of topographical reference; he made me see and trace and see again the"

1047,"great Peace among the warring tribes of men...."
1047,""
1047,"In the retrospect each of us seems to have been talking about our"
1047,"outlook almost continually. Each of us, you see, was full of the same"
1047,"question, very near and altogether predominant to us, the question:"
1047,"""What am I going to do with my life?"" He saw it almost as importantly as"
1047,"I, but from a different angle, because his choice was largely made and"
1047,"mine still hung in the balance."

1047,"""I feel we might do so many things,"" I said, ""and everything that calls"
1047,"one, calls one away from something else."""
1047,""
1047,"Willersley agreed without any modest disavowals."
1047,""
1047,"""We have got to think out,"" he said, ""just what we are and what we are"

1047,""
1047,"""Social Service--education. Whatever else matters or doesn't matter, it"

1047,"""I don't limit myself too narrowly,"" he added. ""After all, the work is"

1047,"joining wall to wall and way to way, the new great England rising out"
1047,"of the decaying old... we are the real statesmen--I like that use of"

1047,"Willersley is middle-aged now, with silver in his hair and a deepening"
1047,"benevolence in his always amiable face, and he has very fairly kept his"
1047,"word. He has lived for social service and to do vast masses of"
1047,"useful, undistinguished, fertilising work. Think of the days of"
1047,"arid administrative plodding and of contention still more arid and"
1047,"unrewarded, that he must have spent! His little affectations of gesture"
1047,"and manner, imitative affectations for the most part, have increased,"
1047,"and the humorous beam and the humorous intonations have become a thing"
1047,"he puts on every morning like an old coat. His devotion is mingled with"
1047,"a considerable whimsicality, and they say he is easily flattered by"
1047,"subordinates and easily offended into opposition by colleagues; he has"
1047,"made mistakes at times and followed wrong courses, still there he is,"
1047,"a flat contradiction to all the ordinary doctrine of motives, a man who"
1047,"has foregone any chances of wealth and profit, foregone any easier paths"
1047,"to distinction, foregone marriage and parentage, in order to serve the"
1047,"community. He does it without any fee or reward except his personal"
1047,"self-satisfaction in doing this work, and he does it without any hope"
1047,"of future joys and punishments, for he is an implacable Rationalist. No"
1047,"doubt he idealises himself a little, and dreams of recognition. No"
1047,"doubt he gets his pleasure from a sense of power, from the spending"
1047,"and husbanding of large sums of public money, and from the inevitable"
1047,"proprietorship he must feel in the fair, fine, well-ordered schools he"
1047,"has done so much to develop. ""But for me,"" he can say, ""there would have"
1047,"been a Job about those diagrams, and that subject or this would have"
1047,"been less ably taught.""..."
1047,""
1047,"The fact remains that for him the rewards have been adequate, if not to"
1047,"content at any rate to keep him working. Of course he covets the"
1047,"notice of the world he has served, as a lover covets the notice of his"
1047,"mistress. Of course he thinks somewhere, somewhen, he will get credit."
1047,"Only last year I heard some men talking of him, and they were noting,"
1047,"with little mean smiles, how he had shown himself self-conscious while"
1047,"there was talk of some honorary degree-giving or other; it would, I have"
1047,"no doubt, please him greatly if his work were to flower into a crimson"
1047,"gown in some Academic parterre. Why shouldn't it? But that is incidental"
1047,"vanity at the worst; he goes on anyhow. Most men don't."
1047,""
1047,"But we had our walk twenty years and more ago now. He was oldish even"
1047,"then as a young man, just as he is oldish still in middle age. Long"
1047,"may his industrious elderliness flourish for the good of the world! He"
1047,"lectured a little in conversation then; he lectures more now and listens"
1047,"less, toilsomely disentangling what you already understand, giving you"
1047,"in detail the data you know; these are things like callosities that come"
1047,"from a man's work."

1047,"Our long three weeks' talk comes back to me as a memory of ideas and"
1047,"determinations slowly growing, all mixed up with a smell of wood smoke"
1047,"and pine woods and huge precipices and remote gleams of snow-fields and"
1047,"the sound of cascading torrents rushing through deep gorges far below."
1047,"It is mixed, too, with gossips with waitresses and fellow travellers,"
1047,"with my first essays in colloquial German and Italian, with disputes"
1047,"about the way to take, and other things that I will tell of in another"
1047,"section. But the white passion of human service was our dominant theme."
1047,"Not simply perhaps nor altogether unselfishly, but quite honestly, and"
1047,"with at least a frequent self-forgetfulness, did we want to do fine and"
1047,"noble things, to help in their developing, to lessen misery, to broaden"
1047,"and exalt life. It is very hard--perhaps it is impossible--to present"
1047,"in a page or two the substance and quality of nearly a month's"
1047,"conversation, conversation that is casual and discursive in form, that"
1047,"ranges carelessly from triviality to immensity, and yet is constantly"
1047,"resuming a constructive process, as workmen on a wall loiter and jest"
1047,"and go and come back, and all the while build."
1047,""
1047,"We got it more and more definite that the core of our purpose beneath"

1047,"said I, ""is the enemy."" That remains my belief to this day. Clearness"
1047,"and order, light and foresight, these things I know for Good. It was"
1047,"muddle had just given us all the still freshly painful disasters and"
1047,"humiliations of the war, muddle that gives us the visibly sprawling"
1047,"disorder of our cities and industrial country-side, muddle that gives us"
1047,"the waste of life, the limitations, wretchedness and unemployment of the"
1047,"poor. Muddle! I remember myself quoting Kipling--"

1047,"We talked of the splendid world of men that might grow out of such"
1047,"unpaid and ill-paid work as we were setting our faces to do. We spoke"
1047,"of the intricate difficulties, the monstrous passive resistances, the"
1047,"hostilities to such a development as we conceived our work subserved,"
1047,"and we spoke with that underlying confidence in the invincibility of the"
1047,"causes we adopted that is natural to young and scarcely tried men."
1047,""
1047,"We talked much of the detailed life of politics so far as it was known"
1047,"to us, and there Willersley was more experienced and far better informed"
1047,"than I; we discussed possible combinations and possible developments,"
1047,"and the chances of some great constructive movement coming from"
1047,"the heart-searchings the Boer war had occasioned. We would sink to"
1047,"gossip--even at the Suetonius level. Willersley would decline towards"
1047,"illuminating anecdotes that I capped more or less loosely from my"
1047,"private reading. We were particularly wise, I remember, upon the"
1047,"management of newspapers, because about that we knew nothing whatever."
1047,"We perceived that great things were to be done through newspapers. We"
1047,"talked of swaying opinion and moving great classes to massive action."
1047,""
1047,"Men are egotistical even in devotion. All our splendid projects were"
1047,"thickset with the first personal pronoun. We both could write, and all"
1047,"that we said in general terms was reflected in the particular in our"
1047,"minds; it was ourselves we saw, and no others, writing and speaking"
1047,"that moving word. We had already produced manuscript and passed the"
1047,"initiations of proof reading; I had been a frequent speaker in the"
1047,"Union, and Willersley was an active man on the School Board. Our feet"
1047,"were already on the lower rungs that led up and up. He was six and"
1047,"twenty, and I twenty-two. We intimated our individual careers in terms"
1047,"of bold expectation. I had prophetic glimpses of walls and hoardings"
1047,"clamorous with ""Vote for Remington,"" and Willersley no doubt saw himself"
1047,"chairman of this committee and that, saying a few slightly ironical"
1047,"words after the declaration of the poll, and then sitting friendly"
1047,"beside me on the government benches. There was nothing impossible in"
1047,"such dreams. Why not the Board of Education for him? My preference at"
1047,"that time wavered between the Local Government Board--I had great ideas"
1047,"about town-planning, about revisions of municipal areas and re-organised"
1047,"internal transit--and the War Office. I swayed strongly towards the"
1047,"latter as the journey progressed. My educational bias came later."

1047,"The swelling ambitions that have tramped over Alpine passes! How many"
1047,"of them, like mine, have come almost within sight of realisation before"

1047,"There were times when we posed like young gods (of unassuming exterior),"
1047,"and times when we were full of the absurdest little solicitudes about"
1047,"our prospects. There were times when one surveyed the whole world of"
1047,"men as if it was a little thing at one's feet, and by way of contrast"
1047,"I remember once lying in bed--it must have been during this holiday,"
1047,"though I cannot for the life of me fix where--and speculating whether"

1047,"of so improbable. There were lapses when it seemed to me I could never"
1047,"be anything but just the entirely unimportant and undistinguished young"
1047,"man I was for ever and ever. I couldn't even think of myself as five and"
1047,"thirty."

1047,"Willersley and I professed ourselves Socialists, but by this time I knew"
1047,"my Rodbertus as well as my Marx, and there was much in our socialism"
1047,"that would have shocked Chris Robinson as much as anything in life could"
1047,"have shocked him. Socialism as a simple democratic cry we had done with"
1047,"for ever. We were socialists because Individualism for us meant muddle,"
1047,"meant a crowd of separated, undisciplined little people all obstinately"
1047,"and ignorantly doing things jarringly, each one in his own way."

1047,"""Essentially,"" said Willersley, ""essentially we're for conscription, in"

1047,""
1047,"Order and devotion were the very essence of our socialism, and a"
1047,"splendid collective vigour and happiness its end. We projected an ideal"

1047,"as balanced and beautiful as a body, as beneficent as sunshine, the"
1047,"organised state that should end muddle for ever; it ruled all our ideals"
1047,"and gave form to all our ambitions."

1047,"Every man was to be definitely related to that, to have his predominant"

1047,"amidst a confusion of heat-bitten greenery. I had been sitting silently"

1047,"I broke into speech, giving form to the thoughts that had been"
1047,"accumulating. My words have long since passed out of my memory, the"
1047,"phrases of familiar expression have altered for me, but the substance"
1047,"remains as clear as ever. I said how we were in our measure emperors"
1047,"and kings, men undriven, free to do as we pleased with life; we classed"
1047,"among the happy ones, our bread and common necessities were given us for"
1047,"nothing, we had abilities,--it wasn't modesty but cowardice to behave"
1047,"as if we hadn't--and Fortune watched us to see what we might do with"
1047,"opportunity and the world."

1047,"about like all those grubby little beasts down there, seeking nothing"
1047,"but mean little vanities and indulgencies--and then take credit for"
1047,"modesty? I KNOW I am capable. I KNOW I have imagination. Modesty! I know"
1047,"if I don't attempt the very biggest things in life I am a damned shirk."

1047,"nearer landscape, and the southward waters with remote coast towns"

1047,"town and saw that multitudinous place in all its beauty of width and"
1047,"abundance and clustering human effort, and once as I was steaming past"
1047,"the brown low hills of Staten Island towards the towering vigour and"
1047,"clamorous vitality of New York City, that mood rose to its quintessence."
1047,"And once it came to me, as I shall tell, on Dover cliffs. And a hundred"
1047,"times when I have thought of England as our country might be, with no"
1047,"wretched poor, no wretched rich, a nation armed and ordered, trained and"
1047,"purposeful amidst its vales and rivers, that emotion of collective ends"

1047,"the thought of women's beauty, their magic presence in the world beside"

1047,"miles away--and as we came down we passed a group of five or six of them"
1047,"resting by the wayside. Their burthens were beside them, and one like"
1047,"Ceres held a reaping hook in her brown hand. She watched us approaching"
1047,"and smiled faintly, her eyes at mine."
1047,""
1047,"There was some greeting, and two of them laughed together."
1047,""
1047,"We passed."
1047,""
1047,"""Glorious girls they were,"" said Willersley, and suddenly an immense"
1047,"sense of boredom enveloped me. I saw myself striding on down that"
1047,"winding road, talking of politics and parties and bills of parliament"
1047,"and all sorts of dessicated things. That road seemed to me to wind on"
1047,"for ever down to dust and infinite dreariness. I knew it for a way of"
1047,"death. Reality was behind us."
1047,""
1047,"Willersley set himself to draw a sociological moral. ""I'm not so"
1047,"sure,"" he said in a voice of intense discriminations, ""after all, that"
1047,"agricultural work isn't good for women."""
1047,""
1047,"""Damn agricultural work!"" I said, and broke out into a vigorous cursing"
1047,"of all I held dear. ""Fettered things we are!"" I cried. ""I wonder why I"
1047,"stand it!"""
1047,""
1047,"""Stand what?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Why don't I go back and make love to those girls and let the world and"
1047,"you and everything go hang? Deep breasts and rounded limbs--and we poor"
1047,"emasculated devils go tramping by with the blood of youth in us!..."""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm not quite sure, Remington,"" said Willersley, looking at me with"
1047,"a deliberately quaint expression over his glasses, ""that picturesque"
1047,"scenery is altogether good for your morals."""
1047,""
1047,"That fever was still in my blood when we came to Locarno."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"13"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"Along the hot and dusty lower road between the Orrido of Traffiume and"
1047,"Cannobio Willersley had developed his first blister. And partly because"
1047,"of that and partly because there was a bag at the station that gave us"
1047,"the refreshment of clean linen and partly because of the lazy lower air"
1047,"into which we had come, we decided upon three or four days' sojourn in"
1047,"the Empress Hotel."
1047,""
1047,"We dined that night at a table-d'hote, and I found myself next to an"
1047,"Englishwoman who began a conversation that was resumed presently in the"
1047,"hotel lounge. She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three or thirty-four,"
1047,"slenderly built, with a warm reddish skin and very abundant fair"
1047,"golden hair, the wife of a petulant-looking heavy-faced man of perhaps"
1047,"fifty-three, who smoked a cigar and dozed over his coffee and"
1047,"presently went to bed. ""He always goes to bed like that,"" she confided"
1047,"startlingly. ""He sleeps after all his meals. I never knew such a man to"
1047,"sleep."""
1047,""
1047,"Then she returned to our talk, whatever it was."
1047,""
1047,"We had begun at the dinner table with itineraries and the usual"
1047,"topographical talk, and she had envied our pedestrian travel. ""My"
1047,"husband doesn't walk,"" she said. ""His heart is weak and he cannot manage"
1047,"the hills."""
1047,""
1047,"There was something friendly and adventurous in her manner; she conveyed"
1047,"she liked me, and when presently Willersley drifted off to write"
1047,"letters our talk sank at once to easy confidential undertones. I felt"
1047,"enterprising, and indeed it is easy to be daring with people one has"
1047,"never seen before and may never see again. I said I loved beautiful"
1047,"scenery and all beautiful things, and the pointing note in my voice made"
1047,"her laugh. She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as I can remember I"
1047,"said she made them bold. ""Blue they are,"" she remarked, smiling archly."
1047,"""I like blue eyes."" Then I think we compared ages, and she said she was"
1047,"the Woman of Thirty, ""George Moore's Woman of Thirty."""
1047,""
1047,"I had not read George Moore at the time, but I pretended to understand."
1047,""
1047,"That, I think, was our limit that evening. She went to bed, smiling"
1047,"good-night quite prettily down the big staircase, and I and Willersley"
1047,"went out to smoke in the garden. My head was full of her, and I found it"
1047,"necessary to talk about her. So I made her a problem in sociology. ""Who"
1047,"the deuce are these people?"" I said, ""and how do they get a living? They"
1047,"seem to have plenty of money. He strikes me as being--Willersley, what"
1047,"is a drysalter? I think he's a retired drysalter."""
1047,""
1047,"Willersley theorised while I thought of the woman and that provocative"
1047,"quality of dash she had displayed. The next day at lunch she and I met"
1047,"like old friends. A huge mass of private thinking during the interval"
1047,"had been added to our effect upon one another. We talked for a time of"
1047,"insignificant things."
1047,""
1047,"""What do you do,"" she asked rather quickly, ""after lunch? Take a"
1047,"siesta?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Sometimes,"" I said, and hung for a moment eye to eye."
1047,""
1047,"We hadn't a doubt of each other, but my heart was beating like a steamer"
1047,"propeller when it lifts out of the water."
1047,""
1047,"""Do you get a view from your room?"" she asked after a pause."
1047,""
1047,"""It's on the third floor, Number seventeen, near the staircase. My"
1047,"friend's next door."""
1047,""
1047,"She began to talk of books. She was interested in Christian Science,"
1047,"she said, and spoke of a book. I forget altogether what that book was"
1047,"called, though I remember to this day with the utmost exactness the"
1047,"purplish magenta of its cover. She said she would lend it to me and"
1047,"hesitated."
1047,""
1047,"Willersley wanted to go for an expedition across the lake that"
1047,"afternoon, but I refused. He made some other proposals that I rejected"
1047,"abruptly. ""I shall write in my room,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""Why not write down here?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I shall write in my room,"" I snarled like a thwarted animal, and he"
1047,"looked at me curiously. ""Very well,"" he said; ""then I'll make some notes"
1047,"and think about that order of ours out under the magnolias."""
1047,""
1047,"I hovered about the lounge for a time buying postcards and feverishly"
1047,"restless, watching the movements of the other people. Finally I went up"
1047,"to my room and sat down by the windows, staring out. There came a"
1047,"little tap at the unlocked door and in an instant, like the go of a taut"
1047,"bowstring, I was up and had it open."
1047,""
1047,"""Here is that book,"" she said, and we hesitated."
1047,""
1047,"""COME IN!"" I whispered, trembling from head to foot."
1047,""
1047,"""You're just a boy,"" she said in a low tone."
1047,""
1047,"I did not feel a bit like a lover, I felt like a burglar with the"
1047,"safe-door nearly opened. ""Come in,"" I said almost impatiently, for"
1047,"anyone might be in the passage, and I gripped her wrist and drew her"
1047,"towards me."
1047,""
1047,"""What do you mean?"" she answered with a faint smile on her lips, and"
1047,"awkward and yielding."
1047,""
1047,"I shut the door behind her, still holding her with one hand, then turned"
1047,"upon her--she was laughing nervously--and without a word drew her to me"
1047,"and kissed her. And I remember that as I kissed her she made a little"
1047,"noise almost like the purring miaow with which a cat will greet one and"
1047,"her face, close to mine, became solemn and tender."
1047,""
1047,"She was suddenly a different being from the discontented wife who had"
1047,"tapped a moment since on my door, a woman transfigured...."
1047,""
1047,"That evening I came down to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I"
1047,"was a man. I felt myself the most wonderful and unprecedented of"
1047,"adventurers. It was hard to believe that any one in the world before"
1047,"had done as much. My mistress and I met smiling, we carried things off"
1047,"admirably, and it seemed to me that Willersley was the dullest old dog"
1047,"in the world. I wanted to give him advice. I wanted to give him derisive"
1047,"pokes. After dinner and coffee in the lounge I was too excited and"
1047,"hilarious to go to bed, I made him come with me down to the cafe under"
1047,"the arches by the pier, and there drank beer and talked extravagant"
1047,"nonsense about everything under the sun, in order not to talk about the"
1047,"happenings of the afternoon. All the time something shouted within me:"
1047,"""I am a man! I am a man!""..."
1047,""
1047,"""What shall we do to-morrow?"" said he."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm for loafing,"" I said. ""Let's row in the morning and spend to-morrow"
1047,"afternoon just as we did to-day."""
1047,""
1047,"""They say the church behind the town is worth seeing."""
1047,""
1047,"""We'll go up about sunset; that's the best time for it. We can start"
1047,"about five."""
1047,""
1047,"We heard music, and went further along the arcade to discover a place"
1047,"where girls in operatic Swiss peasant costume were singing and dancing"
1047,"on a creaking, protesting little stage. I eyed their generous display"
1047,"of pink neck and arm with the seasoned eye of a man who has lived in the"
1047,"world. Life was perfectly simple and easy, I felt, if one took it the"
1047,"right way."
1047,""
1047,"Next day Willersley wanted to go on, but I delayed. Altogether I kept"
1047,"him back four days. Then abruptly my mood changed, and we decided"
1047,"to start early the following morning. I remember, though a little"
1047,"indistinctly, the feeling of my last talk with that woman whose surname,"
1047,"odd as it may seem, either I never learnt or I have forgotten. (Her"
1047,"christian name was Milly.) She was tired and rather low-spirited, and"
1047,"disposed to be sentimental, and for the first time in our intercourse I"
1047,"found myself liking her for the sake of her own personality. There was"
1047,"something kindly and generous appearing behind the veil of naive and"
1047,"uncontrolled sensuality she had worn. There was a curious quality of"
1047,"motherliness in her attitude to me that something in my nature answered"
1047,"and approved. She didn't pretend to keep it up that she had yielded to"
1047,"my initiative. ""I've done you no harm,"" she said a little doubtfully, an"
1047,"odd note for a man's victim! And, ""we've had a good time. You have liked"
1047,"me, haven't you?"""
1047,""
1047,"She interested me in her lonely dissatisfied life; she was childless and"
1047,"had no hope of children, and her husband was the only son of a rich"
1047,"meat salesman, very mean, a mighty smoker--""he reeks of it,"" she said,"
1047,"""always""--and interested in nothing but golf, billiards (which he played"
1047,"very badly), pigeon shooting, convivial Free Masonry and Stock Exchange"
1047,"punting. Mostly they drifted about the Riviera. Her mother had contrived"
1047,"her marriage when she was eighteen. They were the first samples I ever"
1047,"encountered of the great multitude of functionless property owners which"
1047,"encumbers modern civilisation--but at the time I didn't think much of"
1047,"that aspect of them...."
1047,""
1047,"I tell all this business as it happened without comment, because I"
1047,"have no comment to make. It was all strange to me, strange rather than"
1047,"wonderful, and, it may be, some dream of beauty died for ever in those"
1047,"furtive meetings; it happened to me, and I could scarcely have been"
1047,"more irresponsible in the matter or controlled events less if I had"
1047,"been suddenly pushed over a cliff into water. I swam, of course--finding"
1047,"myself in it. Things tested me, and I reacted, as I have told. The bloom"
1047,"of my innocence, if ever there had been such a thing, was gone. And here"
1047,"is the remarkable thing about it; at the time and for some days I was"
1047,"over-weeningly proud; I have never been so proud before or since; I felt"
1047,"I had been promoted to virility; I was unable to conceal my exultation"
1047,"from Willersley. It was a mood of shining shameless ungracious"
1047,"self-approval. As he and I went along in the cool morning sunshine by"
1047,"the rice fields in the throat of the Val Maggia a silence fell between"
1047,"us."
1047,""
1047,"""You know?"" I said abruptly,--""about that woman?"""
1047,""
1047,"Willersley did not answer for a moment. He looked at me over the corner"
1047,"of his spectacles."
1047,""
1047,"""Things went pretty far?"" he asked."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh! all the way!"" and I had a twinge of fatuous pride in my"
1047,"unpremeditated achievement."
1047,""
1047,"""She came to your room?"""
1047,""
1047,"I nodded."
1047,""
1047,"""I heard her. I heard her whispering.... The whispering and rustling and"
1047,"so on. I was in my room yesterday.... Any one might have heard you."""
1047,""
1047,"I went on with my head in the air."
1047,""
1047,"""You might have been caught, and that would have meant endless trouble."
1047,"You might have incurred all sorts of consequences. What did you know"
1047,"about her?... We have wasted four days in that hot close place. When we"
1047,"found that League of Social Service we were talking about,"" he said"
1047,"with a determined eye upon me, ""chastity will be first among the virtues"
1047,"prescribed."""
1047,""
1047,"""I shall form a rival league,"" I said a little damped. ""I'm hanged if I"
1047,"give up a single desire in me until I know why."""
1047,""
1047,"He lifted his chin and stared before him through his glasses at nothing."
1047,"""There are some things,"" he said, ""that a man who means to work--to do"
1047,"great public services--MUST turn his back upon. I'm not discussing the"
1047,"rights or wrongs of this sort of thing. It happens to be the conditions"
1047,"we work under. It will probably always be so. If you want to experiment"
1047,"in that way, if you want even to discuss it,--out you go from political"
1047,"life. You must know that's so.... You're a strange man, Remington, with"
1047,"a kind of kink in you. You've a sort of force. You might happen to do"
1047,"immense things.... Only--"""
1047,""
1047,"He stopped. He had said all that he had forced himself to say."
1047,""
1047,"""I mean to take myself as I am,"" I said. ""I'm going to get experience"
1047,"for humanity out of all my talents--and bury nothing."""
1047,""
1047,"Willersley twisted his face to its humorous expression. ""I doubt if"
1047,"sexual proclivities,"" he said drily, ""come within the scope of the"
1047,"parable."""
1047,""
1047,"I let that go for a little while. Then I broke out. ""Sex!"" said I, ""is"
1047,"a fundamental thing in life. We went through all this at Trinity. I'm"
1047,"going to look at it, experience it, think about it--and get it square"
1047,"with the rest of life. Career and Politics must take their chances of"
1047,"that. It's part of the general English slackness that they won't look"
1047,"this in the face. Gods! what a muffled time we're coming out of! Sex"
1047,"means breeding, and breeding is a necessary function in a nation."
1047,"The Romans broke up upon that. The Americans fade out amidst their"
1047,"successes. Eugenics--"""
1047,""
1047,"""THAT wasn't Eugenics,"" said Willersley."
1047,""
1047,"""It was a woman,"" I said after a little interval, feeling oddly that"
1047,"I had failed altogether to answer him, and yet had a strong dumb case"
1047,"against him."

1047,"CHAPTER THE FIRST ~~ MARGARET IN STAFFORDSHIRE"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,"I must go back a little way with my story. In the previous book I"
1047,"have described the kind of education that happens to a man of my class"
1047,"nowadays, and it has been convenient to leap a phase in my experience"
1047,"that I must now set out at length. I want to tell in this second"
1047,"hook how I came to marry, and to do that I must give something of the"
1047,"atmosphere in which I first met my wife and some intimations of the"
1047,"forces that went to her making. I met her in Staffordshire while I was"
1047,"staying with that uncle of whom I have already spoken, the uncle who"
1047,"sold my father's houses and settled my mother in Penge. Margaret was"
1047,"twenty then and I was twenty-two."
1047,""
1047,"It was just before the walking tour in Switzerland that opened up"
1047,"so much of the world to me. I saw her once, for an afternoon, and"
1047,"circumstances so threw her up in relief that I formed a very vivid"
1047,"memory of her. She was in the sharpest contrast with the industrial"
1047,"world about her; she impressed me as a dainty blue flower might do,"
1047,"come upon suddenly on a clinker heap. She remained in my mind at once a"
1047,"perplexing interrogation and a symbol...."
1047,""
1047,"But first I must tell of my Staffordshire cousins and the world that"
1047,"served as a foil for her."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I first went to stay with my cousins when I was an awkward youth of"
1047,"sixteen, wearing deep mourning for my mother. My uncle wanted to talk"
1047,"things over with me, he said, and if he could, to persuade me to go into"
1047,"business instead of going up to Cambridge."
1047,""
1047,"I remember that visit on account of all sorts of novel things, but"
1047,"chiefly, I think, because it was the first time I encountered anything"
1047,"that deserves to be spoken of as wealth. For the first time in my life"
1047,"I had to do with people who seemed to have endless supplies of money,"
1047,"unlimited good clothes, numerous servants; whose daily life was made"
1047,"up of things that I had hitherto considered to be treats or exceptional"
1047,"extravagances. My cousins of eighteen and nineteen took cabs, for"
1047,"instance, with the utmost freedom, and travelled first-class in the"
1047,"local trains that run up and down the district of the Five Towns with an"
1047,"entire unconsciousness of the magnificence, as it seemed to me, of such"
1047,"a proceeding."
1047,""
1047,"The family occupied a large villa in Newcastle, with big lawns before"
1047,"it and behind, a shrubbery with quite a lot of shrubs, a coach house"
1047,"and stable, and subordinate dwelling-places for the gardener and the"
1047,"coachman. Every bedroom contained a gas heater and a canopied brass"
1047,"bedstead, and had a little bathroom attached equipped with the porcelain"
1047,"baths and fittings my uncle manufactured, bright and sanitary and"
1047,"stamped with his name, and the house was furnished throughout with"
1047,"chairs and tables in bright shining wood, soft and prevalently"
1047,"red Turkish carpets, cosy corners, curtained archways, gold-framed"
1047,"landscapes, overmantels, a dining-room sideboard like a palace with"
1047,"a large Tantalus, and electric light fittings of a gay and expensive"
1047,"quality. There was a fine billiard-room on the ground floor with three"
1047,"comfortable sofas and a rotating bookcase containing an excellent"
1047,"collection of the English and American humorists from THREE MEN IN"
1047,"A BOAT to the penultimate Mark Twain. There was also a conservatory"
1047,"opening out of the dining-room, to which the gardener brought potted"
1047,"flowers in their season...."
1047,""
1047,"My aunt was a little woman with a scared look and a cap that would"
1047,"get over one eye, not very like my mother, and nearly eight years her"
1047,"junior; she was very much concerned with keeping everything nice, and"
1047,"unmercifully bullied by my two cousins, who took after their father and"
1047,"followed the imaginations of their own hearts. They were tall, dark,"
1047,"warmly flushed girls handsome rather than pretty. Gertrude, the eldest"
1047,"and tallest, had eyes that were almost black; Sibyl was of a stouter"
1047,"build, and her eyes, of which she was shamelessly proud, were dark blue."
1047,"Sibyl's hair waved, and Gertrude's was severely straight. They treated"
1047,"me on my first visit with all the contempt of the adolescent girl for a"
1047,"boy a little younger and infinitely less expert in the business of life"
1047,"than herself. They were very busy with the writings of notes and certain"
1047,"mysterious goings and comings of their own, and left me very much to"
1047,"my own devices. Their speech in my presence was full of unfathomable"
1047,"allusions. They were the sort of girls who will talk over and through an"
1047,"uninitiated stranger with the pleasantest sense of superiority."
1047,""
1047,"I met them at breakfast and at lunch and at the half-past six o'clock"
1047,"high tea that formed the third chief meal of the day. I heard them"
1047,"rattling off the compositions of Chaminade and Moskowski, with great"
1047,"decision and effect, and hovered on the edge of tennis foursomes"
1047,"where it was manifest to the dullest intelligence that my presence was"
1047,"unnecessary. Then I went off to find some readable book in the place,"
1047,"but apart from miscellaneous popular novels, some veterinary works, a"
1047,"number of comic books, old bound volumes of THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS"
1047,"and a large, popular illustrated History of England, there was very"
1047,"little to be found. My aunt talked to me in a casual feeble way, chiefly"
1047,"about my mother's last illness. The two had seen very little of each"
1047,"other for many years; she made no secret of it that the ineligible"
1047,"qualities of my father were the cause of the estrangement. The only"
1047,"other society in the house during the day was an old and rather decayed"
1047,"Skye terrier in constant conflict with what were no doubt imaginary"
1047,"fleas. I took myself off for a series of walks, and acquired a"
1047,"considerable knowledge of the scenery and topography of the Potteries."
1047,""
1047,"It puzzled my aunt that I did not go westward, where it was country-side"
1047,"and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses"
1047,"and flowers. But always I went eastward, where in a long valley"
1047,"industrialism smokes and sprawls. That was the stuff to which I turned"
1047,"by nature, to the human effort, and the accumulation and jar of men's"
1047,"activities. And in such a country as that valley social and economic"
1047,"relations were simple and manifest. Instead of the limitless confusion"
1047,"of London's population, in which no man can trace any but the most"
1047,"slender correlation between rich and poor, in which everyone seems"
1047,"disconnected and adrift from everyone, you can see here the works,"
1047,"the potbank or the ironworks or what not, and here close at hand the"
1047,"congested, meanly-housed workers, and at a little distance a small"
1047,"middle-class quarter, and again remoter, the big house of the employer."
1047,"It was like a very simplified diagram--after the untraceable confusion"
1047,"of London."
1047,""
1047,"I prowled alone, curious and interested, through shabby back streets of"
1047,"mean little homes; I followed canals, sometimes canals of mysteriously"
1047,"heated waters with ghostly wisps of steam rising against blackened walls"
1047,"or a distant prospect of dustbin-fed vegetable gardens, I saw the women"
1047,"pouring out from the potbanks, heard the hooters summoning the toilers"
1047,"to work, lost my way upon slag heaps as big as the hills of the south"
1047,"country, dodged trains at manifestly dangerous level crossings, and"
1047,"surveyed across dark intervening spaces, the flaming uproar, the"
1047,"gnome-like activities of iron foundries. I heard talk of strikes and"
1047,"rumours of strikes, and learnt from the columns of some obscure labour"
1047,"paper I bought one day, of the horrors of the lead poisoning that was in"
1047,"those days one of the normal risks of certain sorts of pottery workers."
1047,"Then back I came, by the ugly groaning and clanging steam train of that"
1047,"period, to my uncle's house and lavish abundance of money and more or"
1047,"less furtive flirtations and the tinkle of Moskowski and Chaminade."
1047,"It was, I say, diagrammatic. One saw the expropriator and the"
1047,"expropriated--as if Marx had arranged the picture. It was as jumbled and"
1047,"far more dingy and disastrous than any of the confusions of building and"
1047,"development that had surrounded my youth at Bromstead and Penge, but"
1047,"it had a novel quality of being explicable. I found great virtue in the"
1047,"word ""exploitation."""
1047,""
1047,"There stuck in my mind as if it was symbolical of the whole thing the"
1047,"twisted figure of a man, whose face had been horribly scalded--I can't"
1047,"describe how, except that one eye was just expressionless white--and"
1047,"he ground at an organ bearing a card which told in weak and bitterly"
1047,"satirical phrasing that he had been scalded by the hot water from"
1047,"the tuyeres of the blast furnace of Lord Pandram's works. He had been"
1047,"scalded and quite inadequately compensated and dismissed. And Lord"
1047,"Pandram was worth half a million."
1047,""
1047,"That upturned sightless white eye of his took possession of my"
1047,"imagination. I don't think that even then I was swayed by any crude"
1047,"melodramatic conception of injustice. I was quite prepared to believe"
1047,"the card wasn't a punctiliously accurate statement of fact, and that"
1047,"a case could be made out for Lord Pandram. Still there in the muddy"
1047,"gutter, painfully and dreadfully, was the man, and he was smashed and"
1047,"scalded and wretched, and he ground his dismal hurdygurdy with a weary"
1047,"arm, calling upon Heaven and the passer-by for help, for help and some"
1047,"sort of righting--one could not imagine quite what. There he was as a"
1047,"fact, as a by-product of the system that heaped my cousins with trinkets"
1047,"and provided the comic novels and the abundant cigars and spacious"
1047,"billiard-room of my uncle's house. I couldn't disconnect him and them."
1047,""
1047,"My uncle on his part did nothing to conceal the state of war that"
1047,"existed between himself and his workers, and the mingled contempt and"
1047,"animosity he felt from them."

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"3"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"Prosperity had overtaken my uncle. So quite naturally he believed that"
1047,"every man who was not as prosperous as he was had only himself to blame."
1047,"He was rich and he had left school and gone into his father's business"
1047,"at fifteen, and that seemed to him the proper age at which everyone's"
1047,"education should terminate. He was very anxious to dissuade me from"
1047,"going up to Cambridge, and we argued intermittently through all my"
1047,"visit."
1047,""
1047,"I had remembered him as a big and buoyant man, striding destructively"
1047,"about the nursery floor of my childhood, and saluting my existence by"
1047,"slaps, loud laughter, and questions about half herrings and half eggs"
1047,"subtly framed to puzzle and confuse my mind. I didn't see him for some"
1047,"years until my father's death, and then he seemed rather smaller,"
1047,"though still a fair size, yellow instead of red and much less radiantly"
1047,"aggressive. This altered effect was due not so much to my own changed"
1047,"perspectives, I fancy, as to the facts that he was suffering for"
1047,"continuous cigar smoking, and being taken in hand by his adolescent"
1047,"daughters who had just returned from school."
1047,""
1047,"During my first visit there was a perpetual series of--the only word is"
1047,"rows, between them and him. Up to the age of fifteen or thereabouts, he"
1047,"had maintained his ascendancy over them by simple old-fashioned physical"
1047,"chastisement. Then after an interlude of a year it had dawned upon them"
1047,"that power had mysteriously departed from him. He had tried stopping"
1047,"their pocket money, but they found their mother financially amenable;"
1047,"besides which it was fundamental to my uncle's attitude that he should"
1047,"give them money freely. Not to do so would seem like admitting a"
1047,"difficulty in making it. So that after he had stopped their allowances"
1047,"for the fourth time Sybil and Gertrude were prepared to face beggary"
1047,"without a qualm. It had been his pride to give them the largest"
1047,"allowance of any girls at the school, not even excepting the"
1047,"granddaughter of Fladden the Borax King, and his soul recoiled from this"
1047,"discipline as it had never recoiled from the ruder method of the"
1047,"earlier phase. Both girls had developed to a high pitch in their mutual"
1047,"recriminations a gift for damaging retort, and he found it an altogether"
1047,"deadlier thing than the power of the raised voice that had always"
1047,"cowed my aunt. Whenever he became heated with them, they frowned as if"
1047,"involuntarily, drew in their breath sharply, said: ""Daddy, you really"
1047,"must not say--"" and corrected his pronunciation. Then, at a great"
1047,"advantage, they resumed the discussion...."
1047,""
1047,"My uncle's views about Cambridge, however, were perfectly clear and"
1047,"definite. It was waste of time and money. It was all damned foolery."
1047,"Did they make a man a better business man? Not a bit of it. He gave"
1047,"instances. It spoilt a man for business by giving him ""false ideas."""
1047,"Some men said that at college a man formed useful friendships. What use"
1047,"were friendships to a business man? He might get to know lords, but, as"
1047,"my uncle pointed out, a lord's requirements in his line of faience were"
1047,"little greater than a common man's. If college introduced him to hotel"
1047,"proprietors there might be something in it. Perhaps it helped a man into"
1047,"Parliament, Parliament still being a confused retrogressive corner"
1047,"in the world where lawyers and suchlike sheltered themselves from the"
1047,"onslaughts of common-sense behind a fog of Latin and Greek and twaddle"
1047,"and tosh; but I wasn't the sort to go into Parliament, unless I meant to"
1047,"be a lawyer. Did I mean to be a lawyer? It cost no end of money, and"
1047,"was full of uncertainties, and there were no judges nor great solicitors"
1047,"among my relations. ""Young chaps think they get on by themselves,"" said"
1047,"my uncle. ""It isn't so. Not unless they take their coats off. I took"
1047,"mine off before I was your age by nigh a year."""
1047,""
1047,"We were at cross purposes from the outset, because I did not think men"
1047,"lived to make money; and I was obtuse to the hints he was throwing out"
1047,"at the possibilities of his own potbank, not willfully obtuse, but just"
1047,"failing to penetrate his meaning. Whatever City Merchants had or had"
1047,"not done for me, Flack, Topham and old Gates had certainly barred my"
1047,"mistaking the profitable production and sale of lavatory basins and"
1047,"bathroom fittings for the highest good. It was only upon reflection that"
1047,"it dawned upon me that the splendid chance for a young fellow with my"
1047,"uncle, ""me, having no son of my own,"" was anything but an illustration"
1047,"for comparison with my own chosen career."
1047,""
1047,"I still remember very distinctly my uncle's talk,--he loved to speak"
1047,"""reet Staffordshire""--his rather flabby face with the mottled complexion"
1047,"that told of crude ill-regulated appetites, his clumsy gestures--he kept"
1047,"emphasising his points by prodding at me with his finger--the ill-worn,"
1047,"costly, grey tweed clothes, the watch chain of plain solid gold, and"
1047,"soft felt hat thrust back from his head. He tackled me first in the"
1047,"garden after lunch, and then tried to raise me to enthusiasm by taking"
1047,"me to his potbank and showing me its organisation, from the dusty"
1047,"grinding mills in which whitened men worked and coughed, through the"
1047,"highly ventilated glazing room in which strangely masked girls looked"
1047,"ashamed of themselves,--""They'll risk death, the fools, to show their"
1047,"faces to a man,"" said my uncle, quite audibly--to the firing kilns and"
1047,"the glazing kilns, and so round the whole place to the railway siding"
1047,"and the gratifying spectacle of three trucks laden with executed orders."
1047,""
1047,"Then we went up a creaking outside staircase to his little office, and"
1047,"he showed off before me for a while, with one or two subordinates and"
1047,"the telephone."
1047,""
1047,"""None of your Gas,"" he said, ""all this. It's Real every bit of it. Hard"
1047,"cash and hard glaze."""
1047,""
1047,"""Yes,"" I said, with memories of a carelessly read pamphlet in my mind,"
1047,"and without any satirical intention, ""I suppose you MUST use lead in"
1047,"your glazes?"""
1047,""
1047,"Whereupon I found I had tapped the ruling grievance of my uncle's"
1047,"life. He hated leadless glazes more than he hated anything, except"
1047,"the benevolent people who had organised the agitation for their use."
1047,"""Leadless glazes ain't only fit for buns,"" he said. ""Let me tell you, my"
1047,"boy--"""
1047,""
1047,"He began in a voice of bland persuasiveness that presently warmed to"
1047,"anger, to explain the whole matter. I hadn't the rights of the matter"
1047,"at all. Firstly, there was practically no such thing as lead poisoning."
1047,"Secondly, not everyone was liable to lead poisoning, and it would"
1047,"be quite easy to pick out the susceptible types--as soon as they had"
1047,"it--and put them to other work. Thirdly, the evil effects of"
1047,"lead poisoning were much exaggerated. Fourthly, and this was in a"
1047,"particularly confidential undertone, many of the people liked to get"
1047,"lead poisoning, especially the women, because it caused abortion."
1047,"I might not believe it, but he knew it for a fact. Fifthly, the"
1047,"work-people simply would not learn the gravity of the danger, and would"
1047,"eat with unwashed hands, and incur all sorts of risks, so that as my"
1047,"uncle put it: ""the fools deserve what they get."" Sixthly, he and several"
1047,"associated firms had organised a simple and generous insurance scheme"
1047,"against lead-poisoning risks. Seventhly, he never wearied in rational"
1047,"(as distinguished from excessive, futile and expensive) precautions"
1047,"against the disease. Eighthly, in the ill-equipped shops of his minor"
1047,"competitors lead poisoning was a frequent and virulent evil, and people"
1047,"had generalised from these exceptional cases. The small shops, he"
1047,"hazarded, looking out of the cracked and dirty window at distant"
1047,"chimneys, might be advantageously closed...."
1047,""
1047,"""But what's the good of talking?"" said my uncle, getting off the table"
1047,"on which he had been sitting. ""Seems to me there'll come a time when a"
1047,"master will get fined if he don't run round the works blowing his girls"
1047,"noses for them. That's about what it'll come to."""
1047,""
1047,"He walked to the black mantelpiece and stood on the threadbare rug, and"
1047,"urged me not to be misled by the stories of prejudiced and interested"
1047,"enemies of our national industries."
1047,""
1047,"""They'll get a strike one of these days, of employers, and then we'll"
1047,"see a bit,"" he said. ""They'll drive Capital abroad and then they'll"
1047,"whistle to get it back again.""..."
1047,""
1047,"He led the way down the shaky wooden steps and cheered up to tell me"
1047,"of his way of checking his coal consumption. He exchanged a ferocious"
1047,"greeting with one or two workpeople, and so we came out of the factory"
1047,"gates into the ugly narrow streets, paved with a peculiarly hard"
1047,"diapered brick of an unpleasing inky-blue colour, and bordered with the"
1047,"mean and squalid homes of his workers. Doors stood open and showed grimy"
1047,"interiors, and dirty ill-clad children played in the kennel."
1047,""
1047,"We passed a sickly-looking girl with a sallow face, who dragged her"
1047,"limbs and peered at us dimly with painful eyes. She stood back, as"
1047,"partly blinded people will do, to allow us to pass, although there was"
1047,"plenty of room for us."
1047,""
1047,"I glanced back at her."
1047,""
1047,"""THAT'S ploombism,"" said my uncle casually."
1047,""
1047,"""What?"" said I."
1047,""
1047,"""Ploombism. And the other day I saw a fool of a girl, and what d'you"
1047,"think? She'd got a basin that hadn't been fired, a cracked piece of"
1047,"biscuit it was, up on the shelf over her head, just all over glaze,"
1047,"killing glaze, man, and she was putting up her hand if you please, and"
1047,"eating her dinner out of it. Got her dinner in it!"
1047,""
1047,"""Eating her dinner out of it,"" he repeated in loud and bitter tones, and"
1047,"punched me hard in the ribs."
1047,""
1047,"""And then they comes to THAT--and grumbles. And the fools up in"
1047,"Westminster want you to put in fans here and fans there--the Longton"
1047,"fools have.... And then eating their dinners out of it all the time!""..."
1047,""
1047,"At high tea that night--my uncle was still holding out against evening"
1047,"dinner--Sibyl and Gertrude made what was evidently a concerted demand"
1047,"for a motor-car."
1047,""
1047,"""You've got your mother's brougham,"" he said, ""that's good enough for"
1047,"you."" But he seemed shaken by the fact that some Burslem rival was"
1047,"launching out with the new invention. ""He spoils his girls,"" he"
1047,"remarked. ""He's a fool,"" and became thoughtful."
1047,""
1047,"Afterwards he asked me to come to him into his study; it was a room with"
1047,"a writing-desk and full of pieces of earthenware and suchlike litter,"
1047,"and we had our great row about Cambridge."
1047,""
1047,"""Have you thought things over, Dick?"" he said."
1047,""
1047,"""I think I'll go to Trinity, Uncle,"" I said firmly. ""I want to go to"
1047,"Trinity. It is a great college."""
1047,""
1047,"He was manifestly chagrined. ""You're a fool,"" he said."
1047,""
1047,"I made no answer."
1047,""
1047,"""You're a damned fool,"" he said. ""But I suppose you've got to do it. You"
1047,"could have come here--That don't matter, though, now... You'll have your"
1047,"time and spend your money, and be a poor half-starved clergyman, mucking"
1047,"about with the women all the day and afraid to have one of your own"
1047,"ever, or you'll be a schoolmaster or some such fool for the rest of your"
1047,"life. Or some newspaper chap. That's what you'll get from Cambridge. I'm"
1047,"half a mind not to let you. Eh? More than half a mind...."""
1047,""
1047,"""You've got to do the thing you can,"" he said, after a pause, ""and"
1047,"likely it's what you're fitted for."""

1047,""

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I paid several short visits to Staffordshire during my Cambridge days,"
1047,"and always these relations of mine produced the same effect of hardness."
1047,"My uncle's thoughts had neither atmosphere nor mystery. He lived in"
1047,"a different universe from the dreams of scientific construction that"
1047,"filled my mind. He could as easily have understood Chinese poetry. His"
1047,"motives were made up of intense rivalries with other men of his class"
1047,"and kind, a few vindictive hates springing from real and fancied"
1047,"slights, a habit of acquisition that had become a second nature, a keen"
1047,"love both of efficiency and display in his own affairs. He seemed to"
1047,"me to have no sense of the state, no sense and much less any love of"
1047,"beauty, no charity and no sort of religious feeling whatever. He had"
1047,"strong bodily appetites, he ate and drank freely, smoked a great deal,"
1047,"and occasionally was carried off by his passions for a ""bit of a spree"""
1047,"to Birmingham or Liverpool or Manchester. The indulgences of these"
1047,"occasions were usually followed by a period of reaction, when he was"
1047,"urgent for the suppression of nudity in the local Art Gallery and a"
1047,"harsh and forcible elevation of the superficial morals of the valley."
1047,"And he spoke of the ladies who ministered to the delights of his"
1047,"jolly-dog period, when he spoke of them at all, by the unprintable"
1047,"feminine equivalent. My aunt he treated with a kindly contempt and"
1047,"considerable financial generosity, but his daughters tore his heart; he"
1047,"was so proud of them, so glad to find them money to spend, so resolved"
1047,"to own them, so instinctively jealous of every man who came near them."
1047,""
1047,"My uncle has been the clue to a great number of men for me. He was an"
1047,"illuminating extreme. I have learnt what not to expect from them through"
1047,"him, and to comprehend resentments and dangerous sudden antagonisms I"
1047,"should have found incomprehensible in their more complex forms, if I had"
1047,"not first seen them in him in their feral state."
1047,""
1047,"With his soft felt hat at the back of his head, his rather heavy, rather"
1047,"mottled face, his rationally thick boots and slouching tweed-clad form,"
1047,"a little round-shouldered and very obstinate looking, he strolls through"
1047,"all my speculations sucking his teeth audibly, and occasionally throwing"
1047,"out a shrewd aphorism, the intractable unavoidable ore of the new"
1047,"civilisation."
1047,""
1047,"Essentially he was simple. Generally speaking, he hated and despised in"
1047,"equal measure whatever seemed to suggest that he personally was not"
1047,"the most perfect human being conceivable. He hated all education after"
1047,"fifteen because he had had no education after fifteen, he hated all"
1047,"people who did not have high tea until he himself under duress gave up"
1047,"high tea, he hated every game except football, which he had played and"
1047,"could judge, he hated all people who spoke foreign languages because he"
1047,"knew no language but Staffordshire, he hated all foreigners because he"
1047,"was English, and all foreign ways because they were not his ways. Also"
1047,"he hated particularly, and in this order, Londoner's, Yorkshiremen,"
1047,"Scotch, Welch and Irish, because they were not ""reet Staffordshire,"" and"
1047,"he hated all other Staffordshire men as insufficiently ""reet."" He wanted"
1047,"to have all his own women inviolate, and to fancy he had a call upon"
1047,"every other woman in the world. He wanted to have the best cigars and"
1047,"the best brandy in the world to consume or give away magnificently, and"
1047,"every one else to have inferior ones. (His billiard table was an extra"
1047,"large size, specially made and very inconvenient.) And he hated Trade"
1047,"Unions because they interfered with his autocratic direction of his"
1047,"works, and his workpeople because they were not obedient and untiring"
1047,"mechanisms to do his bidding. He was, in fact, a very naive, vigorous"
1047,"human being. He was about as much civilised, about as much tamed to the"
1047,"ideas of collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African"
1047,"negro."
1047,""
1047,"There are hordes of such men as he throughout all the modern industrial"
1047,"world. You will find the same type with the slightest modifications in"
1047,"the Pas de Calais or Rhenish Prussia or New Jersey or North Italy. No"
1047,"doubt you would find it in New Japan. These men have raised themselves"
1047,"up from the general mass of untrained, uncultured, poorish people in a"
1047,"hard industrious selfish struggle. To drive others they have had first"
1047,"to drive themselves. They have never yet had occasion nor leisure to"
1047,"think of the state or social life as a whole, and as for dreams or"
1047,"beauty, it was a condition of survival that they should ignore such"
1047,"cravings. All the distinctive qualities of my uncle can be thought of as"
1047,"dictated by his conditions; his success and harshness, the extravagances"
1047,"that expressed his pride in making money, the uncongenial luxury that"
1047,"sprang from rivalry, and his self-reliance, his contempt for broad"
1047,"views, his contempt for everything that he could not understand."
1047,""
1047,"His daughters were the inevitable children of his life. Queer girls they"
1047,"were! Curiously ""spirited"" as people phrase it, and curiously limited."
1047,"During my Cambridge days I went down to Staffordshire several times. My"
1047,"uncle, though he still resented my refusal to go into his business, was"
1047,"also in his odd way proud of me. I was his nephew and poor relation, and"
1047,"yet there I was, a young gentleman learning all sorts of unremunerative"
1047,"things in the grandest manner, ""Latin and mook,"" while the sons of his"
1047,"neighhours, not nephews merely, but sons, stayed unpolished in their"
1047,"native town. Every time I went down I found extensive changes and"
1047,"altered relations, and before I had settled down to them off I went"
1047,"again. I don't think I was one person to them; I was a series of"
1047,"visitors. There is a gulf of ages between a gaunt schoolboy of sixteen"
1047,"in unbecoming mourning and two vividly self-conscious girls of eighteen"
1047,"and nineteen, but a Cambridge ""man"" of two and twenty with a first and"
1047,"good tennis and a growing social experience, is a fair contemporary for"
1047,"two girls of twenty-three and twenty-four."
1047,""
1047,"A motor-car appeared, I think in my second visit, a bottle-green"
1047,"affair that opened behind, had dark purple cushions, and was controlled"
1047,"mysteriously by a man in shiny black costume and a flat cap. The high"
1047,"tea had been shifted to seven and rechristened dinner, but my uncle"
1047,"would not dress nor consent to have wine; and after one painful"
1047,"experiment, I gathered, and a scene, he put his foot down and prohibited"
1047,"any but high-necked dresses."
1047,""
1047,"""Daddy's perfectly impossible,"" Sybil told me."
1047,""
1047,"The foot had descended vehemently! ""My own daughters!"" he had said,"
1047,"""dressed up like--""--and had arrested himself and fumbled and decided to"
1047,"say--""actresses, and showin' their fat arms for every fool to stare"
1047,"at!"" Nor would he have any people invited to dinner. He didn't, he had"
1047,"explained, want strangers poking about in his house when he came home"
1047,"tired. So such calling as occurred went on during his absence in the"
1047,"afternoon."
1047,""
1047,"One of the peculiarities of the life of these ascendant families of"
1047,"the industrial class to which wealth has come, is its tremendous"
1047,"insulations. There were no customs of intercourse in the Five Towns. All"
1047,"the isolated prosperities of the district sprang from economising, hard"
1047,"driven homes, in which there was neither time nor means for hospitality."
1047,"Social intercourse centred very largely upon the church or chapel,"
1047,"and the chapels were better at bringing people together than the"
1047,"Establishment to which my cousins belonged. Their chief outlet to the"
1047,"wider world lay therefore through the acquaintances they had formed at"
1047,"school, and through two much less prosperous families of relations who"
1047,"lived at Longton and Hanley. A number of gossiping friendships with old"
1047,"school mates were ""kept up,"" and my cousins would ""spend the afternoon"""
1047,"or even spend the day with these; such occasions led to other encounters"
1047,"and interlaced with the furtive correspondences and snatched meetings"
1047,"that formed the emotional thread of their lives. When the billiard table"
1047,"had been new, my uncle had taken to asking in a few approved friends for"
1047,"an occasional game, but mostly the billiard-room was for glory and the"
1047,"girls. Both of them played very well. They never, so far as I know,"
1047,"dined out, and when at last after bitter domestic conflicts they began"
1047,"to go to dances, they went with the quavering connivance of my aunt,"
1047,"and changed into ball frocks at friends' houses on the way. There was a"
1047,"tennis club that formed a convenient afternoon rendezvous, and I recall"
1047,"that in the period of my earlier visits the young bloods of the district"
1047,"found much satisfaction in taking girls for drives in dog-carts and"
1047,"suchlike high-wheeled vehicles, a disposition that died in tangled"
1047,"tandems at the apparition of motor-car's."
1047,""
1047,"My aunt and uncle had conceived no plans in life for their daughters at"
1047,"all. In the undifferentiated industrial community from which they had"
1047,"sprung, girls got married somehow, and it did not occur to them that"
1047,"the concentration of property that had made them wealthy, had cut their"
1047,"children off from the general social sea in which their own awkward"
1047,"meeting had occurred, without necessarily opening any other world in"
1047,"exchange. My uncle was too much occupied with the works and his business"
1047,"affairs and his private vices to philosophise about his girls; he wanted"
1047,"them just to keep girls, preferably about sixteen, and to be a sort"
1047,"of animated flowers and make home bright and be given things. He was"
1047,"irritated that they would not remain at this, and still more irritated"
1047,"that they failed to suppress altogether their natural interest in young"
1047,"men. The tandems would be steered by weird and devious routes to evade"
1047,"the bare chance of his bloodshot eye. My aunt seemed to have no ideas"
1047,"whatever about what was likely to happen to her children. She had indeed"
1047,"no ideas about anything; she took her husband and the days as they came."
1047,""
1047,"I can see now the pathetic difficulty of my cousins' position in life;"
1047,"the absence of any guidance or instruction or provision for their"
1047,"development. They supplemented the silences of home by the conversation"
1047,"of schoolfellows and the suggestions of popular fiction. They had to"
1047,"make what they could out of life with such hints as these. The church"
1047,"was far too modest to offer them any advice. It was obtruded upon my"
1047,"mind upon my first visit that they were both carrying on correspondences"
1047,"and having little furtive passings and seeings and meetings with the"
1047,"mysterious owners of certain initials, S. and L. K., and, if I remember"
1047,"rightly, ""the R. N."" brothers and cousins, I suppose, of their friends."
1047,"The same thing was going on, with a certain intensification, at my next"
1047,"visit, excepting only that the initials were different. But when I"
1047,"came again their methods were maturer or I was no longer a negligible"
1047,"quantity, and the notes and the initials were no longer flaunted quite"
1047,"so openly in my face."
1047,""
1047,"My cousins had worked it out from the indications of their universe that"
1047,"the end of life is to have a ""good time."" They used the phrase. That"
1047,"and the drives in dog-carts were only the first of endless points of"
1047,"resemblance between them and the commoner sort of American girl. When"
1047,"some years ago I paid my first and only visit to America I seemed to"
1047,"recover my cousins' atmosphere as soon as I entered the train at Euston."
1047,"There were three girls in my compartment supplied with huge decorated"
1047,"cases of sweets, and being seen off by a company of friends, noisily"
1047,"arch and eager about the ""steamer letters"" they would get at Liverpool;"
1047,"they were the very soul-sisters of my cousins. The chief elements of a"
1047,"good time, as my cousins judged it, as these countless thousands of rich"
1047,"young women judge it, are a petty eventfulness, laughter, and to feel"
1047,"that you are looking well and attracting attention. Shopping is one of"
1047,"its leading joys. You buy things, clothes and trinkets for yourself and"
1047,"presents for your friends. Presents always seemed to be flying about"
1047,"in that circle; flowers and boxes of sweets were common currency. My"
1047,"cousins were always getting and giving, my uncle caressed them with"
1047,"parcels and cheques. They kissed him and he exuded sovereigns as a"
1047,"stroked APHIS exudes honey. It was like the new language of the Academy"
1047,"of Lagado to me, and I never learnt how to express myself in it, for"
1047,"nature and training make me feel encumbered to receive presents and"
1047,"embarrassed in giving them. But then, like my father, I hate and"
1047,"distrust possessions."
1047,""
1047,"Of the quality of their private imagination I never learnt anything; I"
1047,"suppose it followed the lines of the fiction they read and was romantic"
1047,"and sentimental. So far as marriage went, the married state seemed at"
1047,"once very attractive and dreadfully serious to them, composed in equal"
1047,"measure of becoming important and becoming old. I don't know what they"
1047,"thought about children. I doubt if they thought about them at all. It"
1047,"was very secret if they did."
1047,""
1047,"As for the poor and dingy people all about them, my cousins were always"
1047,"ready to take part in a Charitable Bazaar. They were unaware of any"
1047,"economic correlation of their own prosperity and that circumambient"
1047,"poverty, and they knew of Trade Unions simply as disagreeable external"
1047,"things that upset my uncle's temper. They knew of nothing wrong in"
1047,"social life at all except that there were ""Agitators."" It surprised them"
1047,"a little, I think, that Agitators were not more drastically put down."
1047,"But they had a sort of instinctive dread of social discussion as of"
1047,"something that might breach the happiness of their ignorance...."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"5"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"My cousins did more than illustrate Marx for me; they also undertook a"
1047,"stage of my emotional education. Their method in that as in everything"
1047,"else was extremely simple, but it took my inexperience by surprise."
1047,""
1047,"It must have been on my third visit that Sybil took me in hand. Hitherto"
1047,"I seemed to have seen her only in profile, but now she became almost"
1047,"completely full face, manifestly regarded me with those violet eyes"
1047,"of hers. She passed me things I needed at breakfast--it was the first"
1047,"morning of my visit--before I asked for them."
1047,""
1047,"When young men are looked at by pretty cousins, they become intensely"
1047,"aware of those cousins. It seemed to me that I had always admired"
1047,"Sybil's eyes very greatly, and that there was something in her"
1047,"temperament congenial to mine. It was odd I had not noted it on my"
1047,"previous visits."
1047,""
1047,"We walked round the garden somewhen that morning, and talked about"
1047,"Cambridge. She asked quite a lot of questions about my work and my"
1047,"ambitions. She said she had always felt sure I was clever."
1047,""
1047,"The conversation languished a little, and we picked some flowers for the"
1047,"house. Then she asked if I could run. I conceded her various starts and"
1047,"we raced up and down the middle garden path. Then, a little breathless,"
1047,"we went into the new twenty-five guinea summer-house at the end of the"
1047,"herbaceous border."
1047,""
1047,"We sat side by side, pleasantly hidden from the house, and she became"
1047,"anxious about her hair, which was slightly and prettily disarranged, and"
1047,"asked me to help her with the adjustment of a hairpin. I had never in my"
1047,"life been so near the soft curly hair and the dainty eyebrow and eyelid"
1047,"and warm soft cheek of a girl, and I was stirred--"
1047,""
1047,"It stirs me now to recall it."
1047,""
1047,"I became a battleground of impulses and inhibitions."
1047,""
1047,"""Thank you,"" said my cousin, and moved a little away from me."
1047,""
1047,"She began to talk about friendship, and lost her thread and forgot the"
1047,"little electric stress between us in a rather meandering analysis of her"
1047,"principal girl friends."
1047,""
1047,"But afterwards she resumed her purpose."
1047,""
1047,"I went to bed that night with one proposition overshadowing everything"
1047,"else in my mind, namely, that kissing my cousin Sybil was a difficult,"
1047,"but not impossible, achievement. I do not recall any shadow of a doubt"
1047,"whether on the whole it was worth doing. The thing had come into my"
1047,"existence, disturbing and interrupting its flow exactly as a fever does."
1047,"Sybil had infected me with herself."
1047,""
1047,"The next day matters came to a crisis in the little upstairs"
1047,"sitting-room which had been assigned me as a study during my visit."
1047,"I was working up there, or rather trying to work in spite of the"
1047,"outrageous capering of some very primitive elements in my brain, when"
1047,"she came up to me, under a transparent pretext of looking for a book."
1047,""
1047,"I turned round and then got up at the sight of her. I quite forget what"
1047,"our conversation was about, but I know she led me to believe I might"
1047,"kiss her. Then when I attempted to do so she averted her face."
1047,""
1047,"""How COULD you?"" she said; ""I didn't mean that!"""
1047,""
1047,"That remained the state of our relations for two days. I developed a"
1047,"growing irritation with and resentment against cousin Sybil, combined"
1047,"with an intense desire to get that kiss for which I hungered and"
1047,"thirsted. Cousin Sybil went about in the happy persuasion that I was"
1047,"madly in love with her, and her game, so far as she was concerned,"
1047,"was played and won. It wasn't until I had fretted for two days that"
1047,"I realised that I was being used for the commonest form of excitement"
1047,"possible to a commonplace girl; that dozens perhaps of young men had"
1047,"played the part of Tantalus at cousin Sybil's lips. I walked about my"
1047,"room at nights, damning her and calling her by terms which on the whole"
1047,"she rather deserved, while Sybil went to sleep pitying ""poor old Dick!"""
1047,""
1047,"""Damn it!"" I said, ""I WILL be equal with you."""
1047,""
1047,"But I never did equalise the disadvantage, and perhaps it's as well, for"
1047,"I fancy that sort of revenge cuts both people too much for a rational"
1047,"man to seek it...."
1047,""
1047,"""Why are men so silly?"" said cousin Sybil next morning, wriggling back"
1047,"with down-bent head to release herself from what should have been a"
1047,"compelling embrace."
1047,""
1047,"""Confound it!"" I said with a flash of clear vision. ""You STARTED this"
1047,"game."""
1047,""
1047,"""Oh!"""
1047,""
1047,"She stood back against a hedge of roses, a little flushed and excited"
1047,"and interested, and ready for the delightful defensive if I should renew"
1047,"my attack."
1047,""
1047,"""Beastly hot for scuffling,"" I said, white with anger. ""I don't know"
1047,"whether I'm so keen on kissing you, Sybil, after all. I just thought you"
1047,"wanted me to."""
1047,""
1047,"I could have whipped her, and my voice stung more than my words."
1047,""
1047,"Our eyes met; a real hatred in hers leaping up to meet mine."
1047,""
1047,"""Let's play tennis,"" I said, after a moment's pause."
1047,""
1047,"""No,"" she answered shortly, ""I'm going indoors."""
1047,""
1047,"""Very well."""
1047,""
1047,"And that ended the affair with Sybil."
1047,""
1047,"I was still in the full glare of this disillusionment when Gertrude"
1047,"awoke from some preoccupation to an interest in my existence. She"
1047,"developed a disposition to touch my hand by accident, and let her"
1047,"fingers rest in contact with it for a moment,--she had pleasant soft"
1047,"hands;--she began to drift into summer houses with me, to let her arm"
1047,"rest trustfully against mine, to ask questions about Cambridge. They"
1047,"were much the same questions that Sybil had asked. But I controlled"
1047,"myself and maintained a profile of intelligent and entirely civil"
1047,"indifference to her blandishments."
1047,""
1047,"What Gertrude made of it came out one evening in some talk--I forget"
1047,"about what--with Sybil."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh, Dick!"" said Gertrude a little impatiently, ""Dick's Pi."""
1047,""
1047,"And I never disillusioned her by any subsequent levity from this theory"
1047,"of my innate and virginal piety."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"6"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"It was against this harsh and crude Staffordshire background that"
1047,"I think I must have seen Margaret for the first time. I say I think"
1047,"because it is quite possible that we had passed each other in the"
1047,"streets of Cambridge, no doubt with that affectation of mutual disregard"
1047,"which was once customary between undergraduates and Newnham girls. But"
1047,"if that was so I had noted nothing of the slender graciousness that"
1047,"shone out so pleasingly against the bleaker midland surroundings."
1047,""
1047,"She was a younger schoolfellow of my cousins', and the step-daughter"
1047,"of Seddon, a prominent solicitor of Burslem. She was not only not in"
1047,"my cousins' generation but not in their set, she was one of a small"
1047,"hardworking group who kept immaculate note-books, and did as much as is"
1047,"humanly possible of that insensate pile of written work that the Girls'"
1047,"Public School movement has inflicted upon school-girls. She really"
1047,"learnt French and German admirably and thoroughly, she got as far in"
1047,"mathematics as an unflinching industry can carry any one with no great"
1047,"natural aptitude, and she went up to Bennett Hall, Newnham, after the"
1047,"usual conflict with her family, to work for the History Tripos."
1047,""
1047,"There in her third year she made herself thoroughly ill through"
1047,"overwork, so ill that she had to give up Newnham altogether and go"
1047,"abroad with her stepmother. She made herself ill, as so many girls do"
1047,"in those university colleges, through the badness of her home and school"
1047,"training. She thought study must needs be a hard straining of the mind."
1047,"She worried her work, she gave herself no leisure to see it as a whole,"
1047,"she felt herself not making headway and she cut her games and exercise"
1047,"in order to increase her hours of toil, and worked into the night. She"
1047,"carried a knack of laborious thoroughness into the blind alleys and"
1047,"inessentials of her subject. It didn't need the badness of the food for"
1047,"which Bennett Hall is celebrated and the remarkable dietary of nocturnal"
1047,"cocoa, cakes and soft biscuits with which the girls have supplemented"
1047,"it, to ensure her collapse. Her mother brought her home, fretting and"
1047,"distressed, and then finding her hopelessly unhappy at home, took her"
1047,"and her half-brother, a rather ailing youngster of ten who died three"
1047,"years later, for a journey to Italy."
1047,""
1047,"Italy did much to assuage Margaret's chagrin. I think all three of them"
1047,"had a very good time there. At home Mr. Seddon, her step-father, played"
1047,"the part of a well-meaning blight by reason of the moods that arose"
1047,"from nervous dyspepsia. They went to Florence, equipped with various"
1047,"introductions and much sound advice from sympathetic Cambridge friends,"
1047,"and having acquired an ease in Italy there, went on to Siena, Orvieto,"
1047,"and at last Rome. They returned, if I remember rightly, by Pisa,"
1047,"Genoa, Milan and Paris. Six months or more they had had abroad, and now"
1047,"Margaret was back in Burslem, in health again and consciously a very"
1047,"civilised person."
1047,""
1047,"New ideas were abroad, it was Maytime and a spring of abundant"
1047,"flowers--daffodils were particularly good that year--and Mrs. Seddon"
1047,"celebrated her return by giving an afternoon reception at short notice,"
1047,"with the clear intention of letting every one out into the garden if the"
1047,"weather held."
1047,""
1047,"The Seddons had a big old farmhouse modified to modern ideas of comfort"
1047,"on the road out towards Misterton, with an orchard that had been rather"
1047,"pleasantly subdued from use to ornament. It had rich blossoming cherry"
1047,"and apple trees. Large patches of grass full of nodding yellow trumpets"
1047,"had been left amidst the not too precisely mown grass, which was as"
1047,"it were grass path with an occasional lapse into lawn or glade. And"
1047,"Margaret, hatless, with the fair hair above her thin, delicately pink"
1047,"face very simply done, came to meet our rather too consciously dressed"
1047,"party,--we had come in the motor four strong, with my aunt in grey silk."
1047,"Margaret wore a soft flowing flowered blue dress of diaphanous material,"
1047,"all unconnected with the fashion and tied with pretty ribbons, like a"
1047,"slenderer, unbountiful Primavera."
1047,""
1047,"It was one of those May days that ape the light and heat of summer, and"
1047,"I remember disconnectedly quite a number of brightly lit figures and"
1047,"groups walking about, and a white gate between orchard and garden and a"
1047,"large lawn with an oak tree and a red Georgian house with a verandah and"
1047,"open French windows, through which the tea drinking had come out upon"
1047,"the moss-edged flagstones even as Mrs. Seddon had planned."
1047,""
1047,"The party was almost entirely feminine except for a little curate with"
1047,"a large head, a good voice and a radiant manner, who was obviously"
1047,"attracted by Margaret, and two or three young husbands still"
1047,"sufficiently addicted to their wives to accompany them. One of them"
1047,"I recall as a quite romantic figure with abundant blond curly hair on"
1047,"which was poised a grey felt hat encircled by a refined black band. He"
1047,"wore, moreover, a loose rich shot silk tie of red and purple, a long"
1047,"frock coat, grey trousers and brown shoes, and presently he removed his"
1047,"hat and carried it in one hand. There were two tennis-playing youths"
1047,"besides myself. There was also one father with three daughters in"
1047,"anxious control, a father of the old school scarcely half broken"
1047,"in, reluctant, rebellious and consciously and conscientiously ""reet"
1047,"Staffordshire."" The daughters were all alert to suppress the possible"
1047,"plungings, the undesirable humorous impulses of this almost feral guest."
1047,"They nipped his very gestures in the bud. The rest of the people were"
1047,"mainly mothers with daughters--daughters of all ages, and a scattering"
1047,"of aunts, and there was a tendency to clotting, parties kept together"
1047,"and regarded parties suspiciously. Mr. Seddon was in hiding, I think,"
1047,"all the time, though not formally absent."
1047,""
1047,"Matters centred upon the tea in the long room of the French windows,"
1047,"where four trim maids went to and fro busily between the house and the"
1047,"clumps of people seated or standing before it; and tennis and croquet"
1047,"were intermittently visible and audible beyond a bank of rockwork rich"
1047,"with the spikes and cups and bells of high spring."
1047,""
1047,"Mrs. Seddon presided at the tea urn, and Margaret partly assisted and"
1047,"partly talked to me and my cousin Sibyl--Gertrude had found a disused"
1047,"and faded initial and was partnering him at tennis in a state of gentle"
1047,"revival--while their mother exercised a divided chaperonage from a seat"
1047,"near Mrs. Seddon. The little curate, stirring a partially empty cup of"
1047,"tea, mingled with our party, and preluded, I remember, every observation"
1047,"he made by a vigorous resumption of stirring."
1047,""
1047,"We talked of Cambridge, and Margaret kept us to it. The curate was a"
1047,"Selwyn man and had taken a pass degree in theology, but Margaret had"
1047,"come to Gaylord's lecturers in Trinity for a term before her breakdown,"
1047,"and understood these differences. She had the eagerness of an exile"
1047,"to hear the old familiar names of places and personalities. We capped"
1047,"familiar anecdotes and were enthusiastic about Kings' Chapel and the"
1047,"Backs, and the curate, addressing himself more particularly to Sibyl,"
1047,"told a long confused story illustrative of his disposition to reckless"
1047,"devilry (of a pure-minded kindly sort) about upsetting two canoes quite"
1047,"needlessly on the way to Grantchester."
1047,""
1047,"I can still see Margaret as I saw her that afternoon, see her fresh fair"
1047,"face, with the little obliquity of the upper lip, and her brow always"
1047,"slightly knitted, and her manner as of one breathlessly shy but"
1047,"determined. She had rather open blue eyes, and she spoke in an even"
1047,"musical voice with the gentlest of stresses and the ghost of a lisp."
1047,"And it was true, she gathered, that Cambridge still existed. ""I went"
1047,"to Grantchester,"" she said, ""last year, and had tea under the"
1047,"apple-blossom. I didn't think then I should have to come down."" (It was"
1047,"that started the curate upon his anecdote.)"
1047,""
1047,"""I've seen a lot of pictures, and learnt a lot about them--at the Pitti"
1047,"and the Brera,--the Brera is wonderful--wonderful places,--but it isn't"
1047,"like real study,"" she was saying presently.... ""We bought bales of"
1047,"photographs,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"I thought the bales a little out of keeping."
1047,""
1047,"But fair-haired and quite simply and yet graciously and fancifully"
1047,"dressed, talking of art and beautiful things and a beautiful land, and"
1047,"with so much manifest regret for learning denied, she seemed a"
1047,"different kind of being altogether from my smart, hard, high-coloured,"
1047,"black-haired and resolutely hatted cousin; she seemed translucent beside"
1047,"Gertrude. Even the little twist and droop of her slender body was a"
1047,"grace to me."
1047,""
1047,"I liked her from the moment I saw her, and set myself to interest and"
1047,"please her as well as I knew how."
1047,""
1047,"We recalled a case of ragging that had rustled the shrubs of Newnham,"
1047,"and then Chris Robinson's visit--he had given a talk to Bennett Hall"
1047,"also--and our impression of him."
1047,""
1047,"""He disappointed me, too,"" said Margaret."
1047,""
1047,"I was moved to tell Margaret something of my own views in the matter of"
1047,"social progress, and she listened--oh! with a kind of urged attention,"
1047,"and her brow a little more knitted, very earnestly. The little curate"
1047,"desisted from the appendices and refuse heaps and general debris of his"
1047,"story, and made himself look very alert and intelligent."
1047,""
1047,"""We did a lot of that when I was up in the eighties,"" he said. ""I'm glad"
1047,"Imperialism hasn't swamped you fellows altogether."""
1047,""
1047,"Gertrude, looking bright and confident, came to join our talk from the"
1047,"shrubbery; the initial, a little flushed and evidently in a state of"
1047,"refreshed relationship, came with her, and a cheerful lady in pink"
1047,"and more particularly distinguished by a pink bonnet joined our little"
1047,"group. Gertrude had been sipping admiration and was not disposed to play"
1047,"a passive part in the talk."
1047,""
1047,"""Socialism!"" she cried, catching the word. ""It's well Pa isn't here. He"
1047,"has Fits when people talk of socialism. Fits!"""
1047,""
1047,"The initial laughed in a general kind of way."

1047,"The curate said there was socialism AND socialism, and looked at"
1047,"Margaret to gauge whether he had been too bold in this utterance. But"
1047,"she was all, he perceived, for broad-mindness, and he stirred himself"
1047,"(and incidentally his tea) to still more liberality of expression. He"
1047,"said the state of the poor was appalling, simply appalling; that there"
1047,"were times when he wanted to shatter the whole system, ""only,"" he said,"
1047,"turning to me appealingly, ""What have we got to put in its place?"""
1047,""
1047,"""The thing that exists is always the more evident alternative,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"The little curate looked at it for a moment. ""Precisely,"" he said"
1047,"explosively, and turned stirring and with his head a little on one side,"
1047,"to hear what Margaret was saying."
1047,""
1047,"Margaret was saying, with a swift blush and an effect of daring, that"
1047,"she had no doubt she was a socialist."
1047,""
1047,"""And wearing a gold chain!"" said Gertrude, ""And drinking out of"
1047,"eggshell! I like that!"""
1047,""
1047,"I came to Margaret's rescue. ""It doesn't follow that because one's a"
1047,"socialist one ought to dress in sackcloth and ashes."""
1047,""
1047,"The initial coloured deeply, and having secured my attention by prodding"
1047,"me slightly with the wrist of the hand that held his teacup, cleared his"
1047,"throat and suggested that ""one ought to be consistent."""
1047,""
1047,"I perceived we were embarked upon a discussion of the elements. We began"
1047,"an interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions of general"
1047,"ideas that are dear to the heart of youth. I and Margaret supported one"
1047,"another as socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and the initial maintained"
1047,"an anti-socialist position, the curate attempted a cross-bench position"
1047,"with an air of intending to come down upon us presently with a casting"
1047,"vote. He reminded us of a number of useful principles too often"
1047,"overlooked in argument, that in a big question like this there was much"
1047,"to be said on both sides, that if every one did his or her duty to every"
1047,"one about them there would be no difficulty with social problems at all,"
1047,"that over and above all enactments we needed moral changes in people"
1047,"themselves. My cousin Gertrude was a difficult controversialist to"
1047,"manage, being unconscious of inconsistency in statement and absolutely"
1047,"impervious to reply. Her standpoint was essentially materialistic;"
1047,"she didn't see why she shouldn't have a good time because other people"
1047,"didn't; they would have a good time, she was sure, if she didn't. She"
1047,"said that if we did give up everything we had to other people, they"
1047,"wouldn't very likely know what to do with it. She asked if we were so"
1047,"fond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and expressed"
1047,"the inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism, everything would"
1047,"be just the same again in ten years' time. She also threw upon us the"
1047,"imputation of ingratitude for a beautiful world by saying that so far as"
1047,"she was concerned she didn't want to upset everything. She was contented"
1047,"with things as they were, thank you."
1047,""
1047,"The discussion led in some way that I don't in the least recall now, and"
1047,"possibly by abrupt transitions, to a croquet foursome in which Margaret"
1047,"involved the curate without involving herself, and then stood beside me"
1047,"on the edge of the lawn while the others played. We watched silently for"
1047,"a moment."
1047,""
1047,"""I HATE that sort of view,"" she said suddenly in a confidential"
1047,"undertone, with her delicate pink flush returning."

1047,""
1047,"""To think we are just to enjoy ourselves,"" she went on; ""just to go on"
1047,"dressing and playing and having meals and spending money!"" She seemed"
1047,"to be referring not simply to my cousins, but to the whole world of"
1047,"industry and property about us. ""But what is one to do?"" she asked. ""I"
1047,"do wish I had not had to come down. It's all so pointless here. There"
1047,"seems to be nothing going forward, no ideas, no dreams. No one here"

1047,""
1047,"""Could you--?"" I began a little doubtfully."
1047,""
1047,"""I suppose I couldn't,"" she answered, after a thoughtful moment. ""I"
1047,"suppose it would come to nothing. And yet I feel there is so much to"
1047,"be done for the world, so much one ought to be doing.... I want to do"
1047,"something for the world."""

1047,"I can see her now as she stood there with her brows nearly frowning, her"
1047,"blue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant. ""One feels that"
1047,"there are so many things going on--out of one's reach,"" she said."

1047,"I went back in the motor-car with my mind full of her, the quality of"

1047,"was, I say, like a protesting blue flower upon a cinder heap. It is"
1047,"curious, too, how she connects and mingles with the furious quarrel"
1047,"I had with my uncle that very evening. That came absurdly. Indirectly"
1047,"Margaret was responsible. My mind was running on ideas she had revived"

1047,"""Not me. But a world that had a collective plan and knew where it meant"
1047,"to be going would do a sight better, anyhow. We're all swimming in a"
1047,"flood of ill-calculated chances--"""

1047,"""You'll be making out I organised that business down there--by"

1047,"""There's a lot of chance in the making of all great businesses,"" I said."

1047,"My uncle remarked that that showed how much I knew about businesses."
1047,"If chance made businesses, why was it that he always succeeded and grew"
1047,"while those fools Ackroyd and Sons always took second place? He showed"
1047,"a disposition to tell the glorious history of how once Ackroyd's"
1047,"overshadowed him, and how now he could buy up Ackroyd's three times"
1047,"over. But I wanted to get out what was in my mind."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh!"" I said, ""as between man and man and business and business, some"
1047,"of course get the pull by this quality or that--but it's forces quite"
1047,"outside the individual case that make the big part of any success"
1047,"under modern conditions. YOU never invented pottery, nor any process in"
1047,"pottery that matters a rap in your works; it wasn't YOUR foresight that"
1047,"joined all England up with railways and made it possible to organise"
1047,"production on an altogether different scale. You really at the utmost"

1047,"to fit what happened to be the requirements of the time, and who"
1047,"happened to be in a position to take advantage of them--"""
1047,""
1047,"It was then my uncle cried out and called me a damned young puppy, and"
1047,"became involved in some unexpected trouble of his own."

1047,"I woke up as it were from my analysis of the situation to discover him"
1047,"bent over a splendid spittoon, cursing incoherently, retching a little,"
1047,"and spitting out the end of his cigar which he had bitten off in his"
1047,"last attempt at self-control, and withal fully prepared as soon as he"
1047,"had cleared for action to give me just all that he considered to be the"
1047,"contents of his mind upon the condition of mine."
1047,""
1047,"Well, why shouldn't I talk my mind to him? He'd never had an outside"
1047,"view of himself for years, and I resolved to stand up to him. We went"
1047,"at it hammer and tongs! It became clear that he supposed me to be a"
1047,"Socialist, a zealous, embittered hater of all ownership--and also an"
1047,"educated man of the vilest, most pretentiously superior description."
1047,"His principal grievance was that I thought I knew everything; to that he"
1047,"recurred again and again...."
1047,""
1047,"We had been maintaining an armed truce with each other since my resolve"
1047,"to go up to Cambridge, and now we had out all that had accumulated"
1047,"between us. There had been stupendous accumulations...."
1047,""
1047,"The particular things we said and did in that bawling encounter matter"
1047,"nothing at all in this story. I can't now estimate how near we came"
1047,"to fisticuffs. It ended with my saying, after a pungent reminder of"
1047,"benefits conferred and remembered, that I didn't want to stay another"
1047,"hour in his house. I went upstairs, in a state of puerile fury, to"
1047,"pack and go off to the Railway Hotel, while he, with ironical civility,"
1047,"telephoned for a cab."
1047,""
1047,"""Good riddance!"" shouted my uncle, seeing me off into the night."
1047,""
1047,"On the face of it our row was preposterous, but the underlying reality"
1047,"of our quarrel was the essential antagonism, it seemed to me, in all"
1047,"human affairs, the antagonism between ideas and the established method,"
1047,"that is to say, between ideas and the rule of thumb. The world I hate"
1047,"is the rule-of-thumb world, the thing I and my kind of people exist"
1047,"for primarily is to battle with that, to annoy it, disarrange it,"
1047,"reconstruct it. We question everything, disturb anything that cannot"
1047,"give a clear justification to our questioning, because we believe"
1047,"inherently that our sense of disorder implies the possibility of a"
1047,"better order. Of course we are detestable. My uncle was of that other"
1047,"vaster mass who accept everything for the thing it seems to be, hate"
1047,"enquiry and analysis as a tramp hates washing, dread and resist change,"
1047,"oppose experiment, despise science. The world is our battleground; and"
1047,"all history, all literature that matters, all science, deals with this"
1047,"conflict of the thing that is and the speculative ""if"" that will destroy"

1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I was twenty-seven when I met Margaret again, and the intervening"
1047,"five years had been years of vigorous activity for me, if not of very"
1047,"remarkable growth. When I saw her again, I could count myself a grown"
1047,"man. I think, indeed, I counted myself more completely grown than I was."
1047,"At any rate, by all ordinary standards, I had ""got on"" very well, and"
1047,"my ideas, if they had not changed very greatly, had become much more"
1047,"definite and my ambitions clearer and bolder."
1047,""
1047,"I had long since abandoned my fellowship and come to London. I had"
1047,"published two books that had been talked about, written several"
1047,"articles, and established a regular relationship with the WEEKLY REVIEW"
1047,"and the EVENING GAZETTE. I was a member of the Eighty Club and learning"
1047,"to adapt the style of the Cambridge Union to larger uses. The London"
1047,"world had opened out to me very readily. I had developed a pleasant"
1047,"variety of social connections. I had made the acquaintance of Mr."
1047,"Evesham, who had been attracted by my NEW RULER, and who talked about"
1047,"it and me, and so did a very great deal to make a way for me into the"
1047,"company of prominent and amusing people. I dined out quite frequently."
1047,"The glitter and interest of good London dinner parties became a common"
1047,"experience. I liked the sort of conversation one got at them extremely,"
1047,"the little glow of duologues burning up into more general discussions,"
1047,"the closing-in of the men after the going of the women, the sage,"
1047,"substantial masculine gossiping, the later resumption of effective talk"
1047,"with some pleasant woman, graciously at her best. I had a wide range"
1047,"of houses; Cambridge had linked me to one or two correlated sets of"
1047,"artistic and literary people, and my books and Mr. Evesham and opened"
1047,"to me the big vague world of ""society."" I wasn't aggressive nor"
1047,"particularly snobbish nor troublesome, sometimes I talked well, and if I"
1047,"had nothing interesting to say I said as little as possible, and I had"
1047,"a youthful gravity of manner that was liked by hostesses. And the other"
1047,"side of my nature that first flared through the cover of restraints at"
1047,"Locarno, that too had had opportunity to develop along the line London"
1047,"renders practicable. I had had my experiences and secrets and adventures"
1047,"among that fringe of ill-mated or erratic or discredited women the"
1047,"London world possesses. The thing had long ago ceased to be a matter of"
1047,"magic or mystery, and had become a question of appetites and excitement,"
1047,"and among other things the excitement of not being found out."
1047,""
1047,"I write rather doubtfully of my growing during this period. Indeed I"
1047,"find it hard to judge whether I can say that I grew at all in any real"
1047,"sense of the word, between three and twenty and twenty-seven. It seems"
1047,"to me now to have been rather a phase of realisation and clarification."
1047,"All the broad lines of my thought were laid down, I am sure, by the date"
1047,"of my Locarno adventure, but in those five years I discussed things over"
1047,"and over again with myself and others, filled out with concrete fact"
1047,"forms I had at first apprehended sketchily and conversationally,"
1047,"measured my powers against my ideals and the forces in the world about"
1047,"me. It was evident that many men no better than myself and with no"
1047,"greater advantages than mine had raised themselves to influential and"
1047,"even decisive positions in the worlds of politics and thought. I was"
1047,"gathering the confidence and knowledge necessary to attack the world in"
1047,"the large manner; I found I could write, and that people would let"
1047,"me write if I chose, as one having authority and not as the scribes."
1047,"Socially and politically and intellectually I knew myself for an honest"
1047,"man, and that quite without any deliberation on my part this showed"
1047,"and made things easy for me. People trusted my good faith from the"
1047,"beginning--for all that I came from nowhere and had no better position"
1047,"than any adventurer."
1047,""
1047,"But the growth process was arrested, I was nothing bigger at"
1047,"twenty-seven than at twenty-two, however much saner and stronger, and"
1047,"any one looking closely into my mind during that period might well have"
1047,"imagined growth finished altogether. It is particularly evident to me"
1047,"now that I came no nearer to any understanding of women during that"
1047,"time. That Locarno affair was infinitely more to me than I had supposed."
1047,"It ended something--nipped something in the bud perhaps--took me at a"
1047,"stride from a vague, fine, ignorant, closed world of emotion to intrigue"
1047,"and a perfectly definite and limited sensuality. It ended my youth, and"
1047,"for a time it prevented my manhood. I had never yet even peeped at the"
1047,"sweetest, profoundest thing in the world, the heart and meaning of a"
1047,"girl, or dreamt with any quality of reality of a wife or any such thing"
1047,"as a friend among womanhood. My vague anticipation of such things in"
1047,"life had vanished altogether. I turned away from their possibility. It"
1047,"seemed to me I knew what had to be known about womankind. I wanted to"
1047,"work hard, to get on to a position in which I could develop and forward"
1047,"my constructive projects. Women, I thought, had nothing to do with that."
1047,"It seemed clear I could not marry for some years; I was attractive to"
1047,"certain types of women, I had vanity enough to give me an agreeable"
1047,"confidence in love-making, and I went about seeking a convenient"
1047,"mistress quite deliberately, some one who should serve my purpose and"
1047,"say in the end, like that kindly first mistress of mine, ""I've done you"
1047,"no harm,"" and so release me. It seemed the only wise way of disposing"
1047,"of urgencies that might otherwise entangle and wreck the career I was"
1047,"intent upon."
1047,""
1047,"I don't apologise for, or defend my mental and moral phases. So it was"
1047,"I appraised life and prepared to take it, and so it is a thousand"
1047,"ambitious men see it to-day...."
1047,""
1047,"For the rest these five years were a period of definition. My political"
1047,"conceptions were perfectly plain and honest. I had one constant desire"
1047,"ruling my thoughts. I meant to leave England and the empire better"
1047,"ordered than I found it, to organise and discipline, to build up a"
1047,"constructive and controlling State out of my world's confusions. We"
1047,"had, I saw, to suffuse education with public intention, to develop a new"
1047,"better-living generation with a collectivist habit of thought, to link"
1047,"now chaotic activities in every human affair, and particularly to catch"
1047,"that escaped, world-making, world-ruining, dangerous thing, industrial"
1047,"and financial enterprise, and bring it back to the service of the"
1047,"general good. I had then the precise image that still serves me as a"
1047,"symbol for all I wish to bring about, the image of an engineer building"
1047,"a lock in a swelling torrent--with water pressure as his only source of"
1047,"power. My thoughts and acts were habitually turned to that enterprise;"
1047,"it gave shape and direction to all my life. The problem that most"
1047,"engaged my mind during those years was the practical and personal"
1047,"problem of just where to apply myself to serve this almost innate"
1047,"purpose. How was I, a child of this confusion, struggling upward through"
1047,"the confusion, to take hold of things? Somewhere between politics and"
1047,"literature my grip must needs be found, but where? Always I seem to"
1047,"have been looking for that in those opening years, and disregarding"
1047,"everything else to discover it."

1047,""
1047,"The Baileys, under whose auspices I met Margaret again, were in the"
1047,"sharpest contrast with the narrow industrialism of the Staffordshire"
1047,"world. They were indeed at the other extreme of the scale, two active"
1047,"self-centred people, excessively devoted to the public service. It was"
1047,"natural I should gravitate to them, for they seemed to stand for the"
1047,"maturer, more disciplined, better informed expression of all I was then"
1047,"urgent to attempt to do. The bulk of their friends were politicians or"
1047,"public officials, they described themselves as publicists--a vague yet"
1047,"sufficiently significant term. They lived and worked in a hard little"
1047,"house in Chambers Street, Westminster, and made a centre for quite an"
1047,"astonishing amount of political and social activity."
1047,""
1047,"Willersley took me there one evening. The place was almost pretentiously"
1047,"matter-of-fact and unassuming. The narrow passage-hall, papered with"
1047,"some ancient yellowish paper, grained to imitate wood, was choked with"
1047,"hats and cloaks and an occasional feminine wrap. Motioned rather than"
1047,"announced by a tall Scotch servant woman, the only domestic I ever"
1047,"remember seeing there, we made our way up a narrow staircase past the"
1047,"open door of a small study packed with blue-books, to discover Altiora"
1047,"Bailey receiving before the fireplace in her drawing-room. She was a"
1047,"tall commanding figure, splendid but a little untidy in black silk and"
1047,"red beads, with dark eyes that had no depths, with a clear hard voice"
1047,"that had an almost visible prominence, aquiline features and straight"
1047,"black hair that was apt to get astray, that was now astray like the"
1047,"head feathers of an eagle in a gale. She stood with her hands behind her"
1047,"back, and talked in a high tenor of a projected Town Planning Bill with"
1047,"Blupp, who was practically in those days the secretary of the local"
1047,"Government Board. A very short broad man with thick ears and fat white"
1047,"hands writhing intertwined behind him, stood with his back to us, eager"
1047,"to bark interruptions into Altiora's discourse. A slender girl in pale"
1047,"blue, manifestly a young political wife, stood with one foot on the"
1047,"fender listening with an expression of entirely puzzled propitiation."
1047,"A tall sandy-bearded bishop with the expression of a man in a trance"
1047,"completed this central group."
1047,""
1047,"The room was one of those long apartments once divided by folding doors,"
1047,"and reaching from back to front, that are common upon the first floors"
1047,"of London houses. Its walls were hung with two or three indifferent"
1047,"water colours, there was scarcely any furniture but a sofa or so and a"
1047,"chair, and the floor, severely carpeted with matting, was crowded with"
1047,"a curious medley of people, men predominating. Several were in evening"
1047,"dress, but most had the morning garb of the politician; the women were"
1047,"either severely rational or radiantly magnificent. Willersley pointed"
1047,"out to me the wife of the Secretary of State for War, and I recognised"
1047,"the Duchess of Clynes, who at that time cultivated intellectuality. I"
1047,"looked round, identifying a face here or there, and stepping back trod"
1047,"on some one's toe, and turned to find it belonged to the Right Hon. G."
1047,"B. Mottisham, dear to the PUNCH caricaturists. He received my apology"
1047,"with that intentional charm that is one of his most delightful traits,"
1047,"and resumed his discussion. Beside him was Esmeer of Trinity, whom I had"
1047,"not seen since my Cambridge days...."
1047,""
1047,"Willersley found an ex-member of the School Board for whom he had"
1047,"affinities, and left me to exchange experiences and comments upon the"
1047,"company with Esmeer. Esmeer was still a don; but he was nibbling, he"
1047,"said, at certain negotiations with the TIMES that might bring him"
1047,"down to London. He wanted to come to London. ""We peep at things from"
1047,"Cambridge,"" he said."
1047,""
1047,"""This sort of thing,"" I said, ""makes London necessary. It's the oddest"
1047,"gathering."""
1047,""
1047,"""Every one comes here,"" said Esmeer. ""Mostly we hate them like"
1047,"poison--jealousy--and little irritations--Altiora can be a horror at"
1047,"times--but we HAVE to come."""

1047,"""Things are being done?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Oh!--no doubt of it. It's one of the parts of the British"
1047,"machinery--that doesn't show.... But nobody else could do it."
1047,""
1047,"""Two people,"" said Esmeer, ""who've planned to be a power--in an original"
1047,"way. And by Jove! they've done it!"""
1047,""
1047,"I did not for some time pick out Oscar Bailey, and then Esmeer"
1047,"showed him to me in elaborately confidential talk in a corner with a"
1047,"distinguished-looking stranger wearing a ribbon. Oscar had none of the"
1047,"fine appearance of his wife; he was a short sturdy figure with a rounded"
1047,"protruding abdomen and a curious broad, flattened, clean-shaven face"
1047,"that seemed nearly all forehead. He was of Anglo-Hungarian extraction,"
1047,"and I have always fancied something Mongolian in his type. He peered"
1047,"up with reddish swollen-looking eyes over gilt-edged glasses that were"
1047,"divided horizontally into portions of different refractive power, and he"
1047,"talking in an ingratiating undertone, with busy thin lips, an eager lisp"
1047,"and nervous movements of the hand."
1047,""
1047,"People say that thirty years before at Oxford he was almost exactly the"
1047,"same eager, clever little man he was when I first met him. He had come"
1047,"up to Balliol bristling with extraordinary degrees and prizes captured"
1047,"in provincial and Irish and Scotch universities--and had made a name for"
1047,"himself as the most formidable dealer in exact fact the rhetoricians"
1047,"of the Union had ever had to encounter. From Oxford he had gone on to a"
1047,"position in the Higher Division of the Civil Service, I think in the"
1047,"War Office, and had speedily made a place for himself as a political"
1047,"journalist. He was a particularly neat controversialist, and very full"
1047,"of political and sociological ideas. He had a quite astounding memory"
1047,"for facts and a mastery of detailed analysis, and the time afforded"
1047,"scope for these gifts. The later eighties were full of politico-social"
1047,"discussion, and he became a prominent name upon the contents list of the"
1047,"NINETEENTH CENTURY, the FORTNIGHTLY and CONTEMPORARY chiefly as a half"
1047,"sympathetic but frequently very damaging critic of the socialism of that"
1047,"period. He won the immense respect of every one specially interested in"
1047,"social and political questions, he soon achieved the limited distinction"
1047,"that is awarded such capacity, and at that I think he would have"
1047,"remained for the rest of his life if he had not encountered Altiora."
1047,""
1047,"But Altiora Macvitie was an altogether exceptional woman, an"
1047,"extraordinary mixture of qualities, the one woman in the world who could"
1047,"make something more out of Bailey than that. She had much of the"
1047,"vigour and handsomeness of a slender impudent young man, and an"
1047,"unscrupulousness altogether feminine. She was one of those women who"
1047,"are waiting in--what is the word?--muliebrity. She had courage and"
1047,"initiative and a philosophical way of handling questions, and she could"
1047,"be bored by regular work like a man. She was entirely unfitted for her"
1047,"sex's sphere. She was neither uncertain, coy nor hard to please, and"
1047,"altogether too stimulating and aggressive for any gentleman's hours of"
1047,"ease. Her cookery would have been about as sketchy as her handwriting,"
1047,"which was generally quite illegible, and she would have made, I feel"
1047,"sure, a shocking bad nurse. Yet you mustn't imagine she was an inelegant"
1047,"or unbeautiful woman, and she is inconceivable to me in high collars or"
1047,"any sort of masculine garment. But her soul was bony, and at the base"
1047,"of her was a vanity gaunt and greedy! When she wasn't in a state of"
1047,"personal untidiness that was partly a protest against the waste of hours"
1047,"exacted by the toilet and partly a natural disinclination, she had a"
1047,"gypsy splendour of black and red and silver all her own. And somewhen in"
1047,"the early nineties she met and married Bailey."
1047,""
1047,"I know very little about her early years. She was the only daughter of"
1047,"Sir Deighton Macvitie, who applied the iodoform process to cotton,"
1047,"and only his subsequent unfortunate attempts to become a Cotton King"
1047,"prevented her being a very rich woman. As it was she had a tolerable"
1047,"independence. She came into prominence as one of the more able of the"
1047,"little shoal of young women who were led into politico-philanthropic"
1047,"activities by the influence of the earlier novels of Mrs. Humphry"
1047,"Ward--the Marcella crop. She went ""slumming"" with distinguished vigour,"
1047,"which was quite usual in those days--and returned from her experiences"
1047,"as an amateur flower girl with clear and original views about the"
1047,"problem--which is and always had been unusual. She had not married, I"
1047,"suppose because her standards were high, and men are cowards and with an"
1047,"instinctive appetite for muliebrity. She had kept house for her father"
1047,"by speaking occasionally to the housekeeper, butler and cook her mother"
1047,"had left her, and gathering the most interesting dinner parties she"
1047,"could, and had married off four orphan nieces in a harsh and successful"
1047,"manner. After her father's smash and death she came out as a writer"
1047,"upon social questions and a scathing critic of the Charity Organisation"
1047,"Society, and she was three and thirty and a little at loose ends when"
1047,"she met Oscar Bailey, so to speak, in the CONTEMPORARY REVIEW. The"
1047,"lurking woman in her nature was fascinated by the ease and precision"
1047,"with which the little man rolled over all sorts of important and"
1047,"authoritative people, she was the first to discover a sort of"
1047,"imaginative bigness in his still growing mind, the forehead perhaps"
1047,"carried him off physically, and she took occasion to meet and subjugate"
1047,"him, and, so soon as he had sufficiently recovered from his abject"
1047,"humility and a certain panic at her attentions, marry him."
1047,""
1047,"This had opened a new phase in the lives of Bailey and herself. The two"
1047,"supplemented each other to an extraordinary extent. Their subsequent"
1047,"career was, I think, almost entirely her invention. She was aggressive,"
1047,"imaginative, and had a great capacity for ideas, while he was almost"
1047,"destitute of initiative, and could do nothing with ideas except remember"
1047,"and discuss them. She was, if not exact, at least indolent, with a"
1047,"strong disposition to save energy by sketching--even her handwriting"
1047,"showed that--while he was inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless"
1047,"invariable calligraphy that grew larger and clearer as the years passed"
1047,"by. She had a considerable power of charming; she could be just as nice"
1047,"to people--and incidentally just as nasty--as she wanted to be. He was"
1047,"always just the same, a little confidential and SOTTO VOCE, artlessly"
1047,"rude and egoistic in an undignified way. She had considerable social"
1047,"experience, good social connections, and considerable social ambition,"
1047,"while he had none of these things. She saw in a flash her opportunity"
1047,"to redeem his defects, use his powers, and do large, novel, rather"
1047,"startling things. She ran him. Her marriage, which shocked her friends"
1047,"and relations beyond measure--for a time they would only speak of Bailey"
1047,"as ""that gnome""--was a stroke of genius, and forthwith they proceeded"
1047,"to make themselves the most formidable and distinguished couple"
1047,"conceivable. P. B. P., she boasted, was engraved inside their wedding"
1047,"rings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant it to be no idle threat. She had"
1047,"discovered very early that the last thing influential people will do is"
1047,"to work. Everything in their lives tends to make them dependent upon a"
1047,"supply of confidently administered detail. Their business is with the"
1047,"window and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon"
1047,"the stock behind for what goes into the window. She linked with that the"
1047,"fact that Bailey had a mind as orderly as a museum, and an invincible"
1047,"power over detail. She saw that if two people took the necessary pains"
1047,"to know the facts of government and administration with precision, to"
1047,"gather together knowledge that was dispersed and confused, to be able to"
1047,"say precisely what had to be done and what avoided in this eventuality"
1047,"or that, they would necessarily become a centre of reference for all"
1047,"sorts of legislative proposals and political expedients, and she went"
1047,"unhesitatingly upon that."
1047,""
1047,"Bailey, under her vigorous direction, threw up his post in the"
1047,"Civil Service and abandoned sporadic controversies, and they devoted"
1047,"themselves to the elaboration and realisation of this centre of public"
1047,"information she had conceived as their role. They set out to study"
1047,"the methods and organisation and realities of government in the most"
1047,"elaborate manner. They did the work as no one had ever hitherto dreamt"
1047,"of doing it. They planned the research on a thoroughly satisfying scale,"
1047,"and arranged their lives almost entirely for it. They took that house"
1047,"in Chambers Street and furnished it with severe economy, they discovered"
1047,"that Scotch domestic who is destined to be the guardian and tyrant of"
1047,"their declining years, and they set to work. Their first book, ""The"
1047,"Permanent Official,"" fills three plump volumes, and took them and their"
1047,"two secretaries upwards of four years to do. It is an amazingly good"
1047,"book, an enduring achievement. In a hundred directions the history and"
1047,"the administrative treatment of the public service was clarified for all"
1047,"time...."
1047,""
1047,"They worked regularly every morning from nine to twelve, they lunched"
1047,"lightly but severely, in the afternoon they ""took exercise"" or Bailey"
1047,"attended meetings of the London School Board, on which he served, he"
1047,"said, for the purposes of study--he also became a railway director"
1047,"for the same end. In the late afternoon Altiora was at home to various"
1047,"callers, and in the evening came dinner or a reception or both."
1047,""
1047,"Her dinners and gatherings were a very important feature in their"
1047,"scheme. She got together all sorts of interesting people in or about"
1047,"the public service, she mixed the obscurely efficient with the"
1047,"ill-instructed famous and the rudderless rich, got together in one room"
1047,"more of the factors in our strange jumble of a public life than had ever"
1047,"met easily before. She fed them with a shameless austerity that kept the"
1047,"conversation brilliant, on a soup, a plain fish, and mutton or boiled"
1047,"fowl and milk pudding, with nothing to drink but whisky and soda, and"
1047,"hot and cold water, and milk and lemonade. Everybody was soon very glad"
1047,"indeed to come to that. She boasted how little her housekeeping cost"
1047,"her, and sought constantly for fresh economies that would enable her,"
1047,"she said, to sustain an additional private secretary. Secretaries were"
1047,"the Baileys' one extravagance, they loved to think of searches going"
1047,"on in the British Museum, and letters being cleared up and precis made"
1047,"overhead, while they sat in the little study and worked together, Bailey"
1047,"with a clockwork industry, and Altiora in splendid flashes between"
1047,"intervals of cigarettes and meditation. ""All efficient public careers,"""
1047,"said Altiora, ""consist in the proper direction of secretaries."""
1047,""
1047,"""If everything goes well I shall have another secretary next year,"""
1047,"Altiora told me. ""I wish I could refuse people dinner napkins. Imagine"
1047,"what it means in washing! I dare most things.... But as it is, they"
1047,"stand a lot of hardship here."""
1047,""
1047,"""There's something of the miser in both these people,"" said Esmeer, and"
1047,"the thing was perfectly true. For, after all, the miser is nothing more"
1047,"than a man who either through want of imagination or want of suggestion"
1047,"misapplies to a base use a natural power of concentration upon one end."
1047,"The concentration itself is neither good nor evil, but a power that"
1047,"can be used in either way. And the Baileys gathered and reinvested"
1047,"usuriously not money, but knowledge of the utmost value in human"
1047,"affairs. They produced an effect of having found themselves--completely."
1047,"One envied them at times extraordinarily. I was attracted, I was"
1047,"dazzled--and at the same time there was something about Bailey's big"
1047,"wrinkled forehead, his lisping broad mouth, the gestures of his hands"
1047,"and an uncivil preoccupation I could not endure...."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"3"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"Their effect upon me was from the outset very considerable."
1047,""
1047,"Both of them found occasion on that first visit of mine to talk to"
1047,"me about my published writings and particularly about my then just"
1047,"published book THE NEW RULER, which had interested them very much. It"
1047,"fell in indeed so closely with their own way of thinking that I doubt if"
1047,"they ever understood how independently I had arrived at my conclusions."
1047,"It was their weakness to claim excessively. That irritation, however,"
1047,"came later. We discovered each other immensely; for a time it produced a"
1047,"tremendous sense of kindred and co-operation."
1047,""
1047,"Altiora, I remember, maintained that there existed a great army of such"
1047,"constructive-minded people as ourselves--as yet undiscovered by one"
1047,"another."
1047,""
1047,"""It's like boring a tunnel through a mountain,"" said Oscar, ""and"
1047,"presently hearing the tapping of the workers from the other end."""
1047,""
1047,"""If you didn't know of them beforehand,"" I said, ""it might be a rather"
1047,"badly joined tunnel."""
1047,""
1047,"""Exactly,"" said Altiora with a high note, ""and that's why we all want to"
1047,"find out each other...."""
1047,""
1047,"They didn't talk like that on our first encounter, but they urged me to"
1047,"lunch with them next day, and then it was we went into things. A woman"
1047,"Factory Inspector and the Educational Minister for New Banksland and his"
1047,"wife were also there, but I don't remember they made any contribution"
1047,"to the conversation. The Baileys saw to that. They kept on at me in an"
1047,"urgent litigious way."
1047,""
1047,"""We have read your book,"" each began--as though it had been a joint"
1047,"function. ""And we consider--"""
1047,""
1047,"""Yes,"" I protested, ""I think--"""
1047,""
1047," That was a secondary matter."
1047,""
1047,"""They did not consider,"" said Altiora, raising her voice and going right"
1047,"over me, ""that I had allowed sufficiently for the inevitable development"
1047,"of an official administrative class in the modern state."""
1047,""
1047,"""Nor of its importance,"" echoed Oscar."
1047,""
1047,"That, they explained in a sort of chorus, was the cardinal idea of their"
1047,"lives, what they were up to, what they stood for. ""We want to suggest to"
1047,"you,"" they said--and I found this was a stock opening of theirs--""that"
1047,"from the mere necessities of convenience elected bodies MUST avail"
1047,"themselves more and more of the services of expert officials. We have"
1047,"that very much in mind. The more complicated and technical affairs"
1047,"become, the less confidence will the elected official have in himself."
1047,"We want to suggest that these expert officials must necessarily develop"
1047,"into a new class and a very powerful class in the community. We want to"
1047,"organise that. It may be THE power of the future. They will necessarily"
1047,"have to have very much of a common training. We consider ourselves as"
1047,"amateur unpaid precursors of such a class.""..."
1047,""
1047,"The vision they displayed for my consideration as the aim of"
1047,"public-spirited endeavour, seemed like a harder, narrower, more"
1047,"specialised version of the idea of a trained and disciplined state that"
1047,"Willersley and I had worked out in the Alps. They wanted things more"
1047,"organised, more correlated with government and a collective purpose,"
1047,"just as we did, but they saw it not in terms of a growing collective"
1047,"understanding, but in terms of functionaries, legislative change, and"
1047,"methods of administration...."
1047,""
1047,"It wasn't clear at first how we differed. The Baileys were very anxious"
1047,"to win me to co-operation, and I was quite prepared at first to identify"
1047,"their distinctive expressions with phrases of my own, and so we came"
1047,"very readily into an alliance that was to last some years, and break at"
1047,"last very painfully. Altiora manifestly liked me, I was soon discussing"
1047,"with her the perplexity I found in placing myself efficiently in the"
1047,"world, the problem of how to take hold of things that occupied my"
1047,"thoughts, and she was sketching out careers for my consideration, very"
1047,"much as an architect on his first visit sketches houses, considers"
1047,"requirements, and puts before you this example and that of the more or"
1047,"less similar thing already done...."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"4"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"It is easy to see how much in common there was between the Baileys and"
1047,"me, and how natural it was that I should become a constant visitor at"
1047,"their house and an ally of theirs in many enterprises. It is not nearly"
1047,"so easy to define the profound antagonism of spirit that also held"
1047,"between us. There was a difference in texture, a difference in quality."
1047,"How can I express it? The shapes of our thoughts were the same, but the"
1047,"substance quite different. It was as if they had made in china or cast"
1047,"iron what I had made in transparent living matter. (The comparison is"
1047,"manifestly from my point of view.) Certain things never seemed to show"
1047,"through their ideas that were visible, refracted perhaps and distorted,"
1047,"but visible always through mine."
1047,""
1047,"I thought for a time the essential difference lay in our relation to"
1047,"beauty. With me beauty is quite primary in life; I like truth, order"
1047,"and goodness, wholly because they are beautiful or lead straight to"
1047,"beautiful consequences. The Baileys either hadn't got that or they"
1047,"didn't see it. They seemed at times to prefer things harsh and ugly."
1047,"That puzzled me extremely. The esthetic quality of many of their"
1047,"proposals, the ""manners"" of their work, so to speak, were at times as"
1047,"dreadful as--well, War Office barrack architecture. A caricature by"
1047,"its exaggerated statements will sometimes serve to point a truth by"
1047,"antagonising falsity and falsity. I remember talking to a prominent"
1047,"museum official in need of more public funds for the work he had in"
1047,"hand. I mentioned the possibility of enlisting Bailey's influence."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh, we don't want Philistines like that infernal Bottle-Imp running"
1047,"us,"" he said hastily, and would hear of no concerted action for the end"
1047,"he had in view. ""I'd rather not have the extension."
1047,""
1047,"""You see,"" he went on to explain, ""Bailey's wanting in the essentials."""
1047,""
1047,"""What essentials?"" said I."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh! he'd be like a nasty oily efficient little machine for some merely"
1047,"subordinate necessity among all my delicate stuff. He'd do all we wanted"
1047,"no doubt in the way of money and powers--and he'd do it wrong and mess"
1047,"the place for ever. Hands all black, you know. He's just a means. Just a"
1047,"very aggressive and unmanageable means. This isn't a plumber's job...."""
1047,""
1047,"I stuck to my argument."
1047,""
1047,"""I don't LIKE him,"" said the official conclusively, and it seemed to me"
1047,"at the time he was just blind prejudice speaking...."
1047,""
1047,"I came nearer the truth of the matter as I came to realise that"
1047,"our philosophies differed profoundly. That isn't a very curable"
1047,"difference,--once people have grown up. Theirs was a philosophy devoid"
1047,"of FINESSE. Temperamentally the Baileys were specialised, concentrated,"
1047,"accurate, while I am urged either by some Inner force or some entirely"
1047,"assimilated influence in my training, always to round off and shadow"
1047,"my outlines. I hate them hard. I would sacrifice detail to modelling"
1047,"always, and the Baileys, it seemed to me, loved a world as flat and"
1047,"metallic as Sidney Cooper's cows. If they had the universe in hand I"
1047,"know they would take down all the trees and put up stamped tin green"
1047,"shades and sunlight accumulators. Altiora thought trees hopelessly"
1047,"irregular and sea cliffs a great mistake.... I got things clearer as"
1047,"time went on. Though it was an Hegelian mess of which I had partaken at"
1047,"Codger's table by way of a philosophical training, my sympathies have"
1047,"always been Pragmatist. I belong almost by nature to that school of"
1047,"Pragmatism that, following the medieval Nominalists, bases itself upon"
1047,"a denial of the reality of classes, and of the validity of general"
1047,"laws. The Baileys classified everything. They were, in the scholastic"
1047,"sense--which so oddly contradicts the modern use of the word ""Realists."""
1047,"They believed classes were REAL and independent of their individuals."
1047,"This is the common habit of all so-called educated people who have no"
1047,"metaphysical aptitude and no metaphysical training. It leads them to a"
1047,"progressive misunderstanding of the world. It was a favourite trick"
1047,"of Altiora's to speak of everybody as a ""type""; she saw men as samples"
1047,"moving; her dining-room became a chamber of representatives. It gave"
1047,"a tremendously scientific air to many of their generalisations, using"
1047,"""scientific"" in its nineteenth-century uncritical Herbert Spencer sense,"
1047,"an air that only began to disappear when you thought them over again in"
1047,"terms of actuality and the people one knew...."
1047,""
1047,"At the Baileys' one always seemed to be getting one's hands on the very"
1047,"strings that guided the world. You heard legislation projected to affect"
1047,"this ""type"" and that; statistics marched by you with sin and shame and"
1047,"injustice and misery reduced to quite manageable percentages, you found"
1047,"men who were to frame or amend bills in grave and intimate exchange"
1047,"with Bailey's omniscience, you heard Altiora canvassing approaching"
1047,"resignations and possible appointments that might make or mar a"
1047,"revolution in administrative methods, and doing it with a vigorous"
1047,"directness that manifestly swayed the decision; and you felt you were"
1047,"in a sort of signal box with levers all about you, and the world outside"
1047,"there, albeit a little dark and mysterious beyond the window, running"
1047,"on its lines in ready obedience to these unhesitating lights, true and"
1047,"steady to trim termini."
1047,""
1047,"And then with all this administrative fizzle, this pseudo-scientific"
1047,"administrative chatter, dying away in your head, out you went into the"
1047,"limitless grimy chaos of London streets and squares, roads and avenues"
1047,"lined with teeming houses, each larger than the Chambers Street house"
1047,"and at least equally alive, you saw the chaotic clamour of hoardings,"
1047,"the jumble of traffic, the coming and going of mysterious myriads,"
1047,"you heard the rumble of traffic like the noise of a torrent; a vague"
1047,"incessant murmur of cries and voices, wanton crimes and accidents bawled"
1047,"at you from the placards; imperative unaccountable fashions swaggered"
1047,"triumphant in dazzling windows of the shops; and you found yourself"
1047,"swaying back to the opposite conviction that the huge formless spirit"

1047,"Under the lamps you were jostled by people like my Staffordshire uncle"

1047,"I was accustomed to go early to the Baileys' dinners in those days, for"
1047,"a preliminary gossip with Altiora in front of her drawing-room fire. One"
1047,"got her alone, and that early arrival was a little sign of appreciation"
1047,"she valued. She had every woman's need of followers and servants."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm going to send you down to-night,"" she said, ""with a very"
1047,"interesting type indeed--one of the new generation of serious gals."
1047,"Middle-class origin--and quite well off. Rich in fact. Her step-father"
1047,"was a solicitor and something of an ENTREPRENEUR towards the end, I"
1047,"fancy--in the Black Country. There was a little brother died, and she's"
1047,"lost her mother quite recently. Quite on her own, so to speak. She's"
1047,"never been out into society very much, and doesn't seem really very"
1047,"anxious to go.... Not exactly an intellectual person, you know, but"
1047,"quiet, and great force of character. Came up to London on her own and"
1047,"came to us--someone had told her we were the sort of people to advise"
1047,"her--to ask what to do. I'm sure she'll interest you."""
1047,""
1047,"""What CAN people of that sort do?"" I asked. ""Is she capable of"
1047,"investigation?"""
1047,""
1047,"Altiora compressed her lips and shook her head. She always did shake her"
1047,"head when you asked that of anyone."
1047,""
1047,"""Of course what she ought to do,"" said Altiora, with her silk dress"
1047,"pulled back from her knee before the fire, and with a lift of her voice"
1047,"towards a chuckle at her daring way of putting things, ""is to marry a"
1047,"member of Parliament and see he does his work.... Perhaps she will."
1047,"It's a very exceptional gal who can do anything by herself--quite"
1047,"exceptional. The more serious they are--without being exceptional--the"
1047,"more we want them to marry."""
1047,""
1047,"Her exposition was truncated by the entry of the type in question."
1047,""
1047,"""Well!"" cried Altiora turning, and with a high note of welcome, ""HERE"
1047,"you are!"""
1047,""
1047,"Margaret had gained in dignity and prettiness by the lapse of five"
1047,"years, and she was now very beautifully and richly and simply dressed."
1047,"Her fair hair had been done in some way that made it seem softer and"
1047,"more abundant than it was in my memory, and a gleam of purple velvet-set"
1047,"diamonds showed amidst its mist of little golden and brown lines."
1047,"Her dress was of white and violet, the last trace of mourning for her"
1047,"mother, and confessed the gracious droop of her tall and slender body."
1047,"She did not suggest Staffordshire at all, and I was puzzled for a moment"
1047,"to think where I had met her. Her sweetly shaped mouth with the"
1047,"slight obliquity of the lip and the little kink in her brow were"
1047,"extraordinarily familiar to me. But she had either been prepared"
1047,"by Altiora or she remembered my name. ""We met,"" she said, ""while my"
1047,"step-father was alive--at Misterton. You came to see us""; and instantly"
1047,"I recalled the sunshine between the apple blossom and a slender pale"
1047,"blue girlish shape among the daffodils, like something that had sprung"
1047,"from a bulb itself. I recalled at once that I had found her very"
1047,"interesting, though I did not clearly remember how it was she had"
1047,"interested me."
1047,""
1047,"Other guests arrived--it was one of Altiora's boldly blended mixtures of"
1047,"people with ideas and people with influence or money who might perhaps"
1047,"be expected to resonate to them. Bailey came down late with an air of"
1047,"hurry, and was introduced to Margaret and said absolutely nothing to"
1047,"her--there being no information either to receive or impart and nothing"
1047,"to do--but stood snatching his left cheek until I rescued him and her,"
1047,"and left him free to congratulate the new Lady Snape on her husband's K."
1047,"C. B."
1047,""
1047,"I took Margaret down. We achieved no feats of mutual expression, except"
1047,"that it was abundantly clear we were both very pleased and interested"
1047,"to meet again, and that we had both kept memories of each other. We made"
1047,"that Misterton tea-party and the subsequent marriages of my cousins"
1047,"and the world of Burslem generally, matter for quite an agreeable"
1047,"conversation until at last Altiora, following her invariable custom,"
1047,"called me by name imperatively out of our duologue. ""Mr. Remington,"" she"
1047,"said, ""we want your opinion--"" in her entirely characteristic effort to"
1047,"get all the threads of conversation into her own hands for the climax"
1047,"that always wound up her dinners. How the other women used to hate those"
1047,"concluding raids of hers! I forget most of the other people at that"
1047,"dinner, nor can I recall what the crowning rally was about. It didn't in"
1047,"any way join on to my impression of Margaret."
1047,""
1047,"In the drawing-room of the matting floor I rejoined her, with Altiora's"
1047,"manifest connivance, and in the interval I had been thinking of our"
1047,"former meeting."
1047,""
1047,"""Do you find London,"" I asked, ""give you more opportunity for doing"
1047,"things and learning things than Burslem?"""
1047,""
1047,"She showed at once she appreciated my allusion to her former"
1047,"confidences. ""I was very discontented then,"" she said and paused. ""I've"
1047,"really only been in London for a few months. It's so different. In"
1047,"Burslem, life seems all business and getting--without any reason. One"
1047,"went on and it didn't seem to mean anything. At least anything that"
1047,"mattered.... London seems to be so full of meanings--all mixed up"
1047,"together."""
1047,""
1047,"She knitted her brows over her words and smiled appealingly at the end"
1047,"as if for consideration for her inadequate expression, appealingly and"
1047,"almost humorously."
1047,""
1047,"I looked understandingly at her. ""We have all,"" I agreed, ""to come to"
1047,"London."""
1047,""
1047,"""One sees so much distress,"" she added, as if she felt she had"
1047,"completely omitted something, and needed a codicil."
1047,""
1047,"""What are you doing in London?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm thinking of studying. Some social question. I thought perhaps I"
1047,"might go and study social conditions as Mrs. Bailey did, go perhaps as"
1047,"a work-girl or see the reality of living in, but Mrs. Bailey thought"
1047,"perhaps it wasn't quite my work."""
1047,""
1047,"""Are you studying?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm going to a good many lectures, and perhaps I shall take up a"
1047,"regular course at the Westminster School of Politics and Sociology. But"
1047,"Mrs. Bailey doesn't seem to believe very much in that either."""
1047,""
1047,"Her faintly whimsical smile returned. ""I seem rather indefinite,"" she"
1047,"apologised, ""but one does not want to get entangled in things one can't"
1047,"do. One--one has so many advantages, one's life seems to be such a trust"
1047,"and such a responsibility--"""
1047,""
1047,"She stopped."
1047,""
1047,"""A man gets driven into work,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""It must be splendid to be Mrs. Bailey,"" she replied with a glance of"
1047,"envious admiration across the room."
1047,""
1047,"""SHE has no doubts, anyhow,"" I remarked."
1047,""
1047,"""She HAD,"" said Margaret with the pride of one who has received great"
1047,"confidences."

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"6"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"""You've met before?"" said Altiora, a day or so later."
1047,""
1047,"I explained when."
1047,""
1047,"""You find her interesting?"""
1047,""
1047,"I saw in a flash that Altiora meant to marry me to Margaret."
1047,""
1047,"Her intention became much clearer as the year developed. Altiora was"
1047,"systematic even in matters that evade system. I was to marry Margaret,"
1047,"and freed from the need of making an income I was to come into"
1047,"politics--as an exponent of Baileyism. She put it down with the other"
1047,"excellent and advantageous things that should occupy her summer holiday."
1047,"It was her pride and glory to put things down and plan them out in"
1047,"detail beforehand, and I'm not quite sure that she did not even mark"
1047,"off the day upon which the engagement was to be declared. If she did,"
1047,"I disappointed her. We didn't come to an engagement, in spite of the"
1047,"broadest hints and the glaring obviousness of everything, that summer."
1047,""
1047,"Every summer the Baileys went out of London to some house they hired"
1047,"or borrowed, leaving their secretaries toiling behind, and they went"
1047,"on working hard in the mornings and evenings and taking exercise in the"
1047,"open air in the afternoon. They cycled assiduously and went for long"
1047,"walks at a trot, and raided and studied (and incidentally explained"
1047,"themselves to) any social ""types"" that lived in the neighbourhood. One"
1047,"invaded type, resentful under research, described them with a dreadful"
1047,"aptness as Donna Quixote and Sancho Panza--and himself as a harmless"
1047,"windmill, hurting no one and signifying nothing. She did rather tilt"
1047,"at things. This particular summer they were at a pleasant farmhouse in"
1047,"level country near Pangbourne, belonging to the Hon. Wilfrid Winchester,"
1047,"and they asked me to come down to rooms in the neighbourhood--Altiora"
1047,"took them for a month for me in August--and board with them upon"
1047,"extremely reasonable terms; and when I got there I found Margaret"
1047,"sitting in a hammock at Altiora's feet. Lots of people, I gathered, were"
1047,"coming and going in the neighbourhood, the Ponts were in a villa on the"
1047,"river, and the Rickhams' houseboat was to moor for some days; but these"
1047,"irruptions did not impede a great deal of duologue between Margaret and"
1047,"myself."
1047,""
1047,"Altiora was efficient rather than artistic in her match-making. She sent"
1047,"us off for long walks together--Margaret was a fairly good walker--she"
1047,"exhumed some defective croquet things and incited us to croquet, not"
1047,"understanding that detestable game is the worst stimulant for lovers"
1047,"in the world. And Margaret and I were always getting left about, and"
1047,"finding ourselves for odd half-hours in the kitchen-garden with nothing"
1047,"to do except talk, or we were told with a wave of the hand to run away"
1047,"and amuse each other."
1047,""
1047,"Altiora even tried a picnic in canoes, knowing from fiction rather than"
1047,"imagination or experience the conclusive nature of such excursions. But"
1047,"there she fumbled at the last moment, and elected at the river's brink"
1047,"to share a canoe with me. Bailey showed so much zeal and so little"
1047,"skill--his hat fell off and he became miraculously nothing but"
1047,"paddle-clutching hands and a vast wrinkled brow--that at last he had to"
1047,"be paddled ignominiously by Margaret, while Altiora, after a phase of"
1047,"rigid discretion, as nearly as possible drowned herself--and me no doubt"
1047,"into the bargain--with a sudden lateral gesture of the arm to emphasise"
1047,"the high note with which she dismissed the efficiency of the Charity"
1047,"Organisation Society. We shipped about an inch of water and sat in it"
1047,"for the rest of the time, an inconvenience she disregarded heroically."
1047,"We had difficulties in landing Oscar from his frail craft upon the ait"
1047,"of our feasting,--he didn't balance sideways and was much alarmed, and"
1047,"afterwards, as Margaret had a pain in her back, I took him in my canoe,"
1047,"let him hide his shame with an ineffectual but not positively harmful"
1047,"paddle, and towed the other by means of the joined painters. Still it"
1047,"was the fault of the inadequate information supplied in the books and"
1047,"not of Altiora that that was not the date of my betrothal."
1047,""
1047,"I find it not a little difficult to state what kept me back from"
1047,"proposing marriage to Margaret that summer, and what urged me forward"
1047,"at last to marry her. It is so much easier to remember one's resolutions"
1047,"than to remember the moods and suggestions that produced them."
1047,""
1047,"Marrying and getting married was, I think, a pretty simple affair to"
1047,"Altiora; it was something that happened to the adolescent and unmarried"
1047,"when you threw them together under the circumstances of health, warmth"
1047,"and leisure. It happened with the kindly and approving smiles of the"
1047,"more experienced elders who had organised these proximities. The young"
1047,"people married, settled down, children ensued, and father and mother"
1047,"turned their minds, now decently and properly disillusioned, to other"
1047,"things. That to Altiora was the normal sexual life, and she believed it"
1047,"to be the quality of the great bulk of the life about her."
1047,""
1047,"One of the great barriers to human understanding is the wide"
1047,"temperamental difference one finds in the values of things relating to"
1047,"sex. It is the issue upon which people most need training in charity and"
1047,"imaginative sympathy. Here are no universal standards at all, and indeed"
1047,"for no single man nor woman does there seem to be any fixed standard, so"
1047,"much do the accidents of circumstances and one's physical phases affect"
1047,"one's interpretations. There is nothing in the whole range of sexual"
1047,"fact that may not seem supremely beautiful or humanly jolly or"
1047,"magnificently wicked or disgusting or trivial or utterly insignificant,"
1047,"according to the eye that sees or the mood that colours. Here is"
1047,"something that may fill the skies and every waking hour or be almost"
1047,"completely banished from a life. It may be everything on Monday and less"
1047,"than nothing on Saturday. And we make our laws and rules as though in"
1047,"these matters all men and women were commensurable one with another,"
1047,"with an equal steadfast passion and an equal constant duty...."
1047,""
1047,"I don't know what dreams Altiora may have had in her schoolroom days, I"
1047,"always suspected her of suppressed and forgotten phases, but certainly"
1047,"her general effect now was of an entirely passionless worldliness in"
1047,"these matters. Indeed so far as I could get at her, she regarded sexual"
1047,"passion as being hardly more legitimate in a civilised person than--let"
1047,"us say--homicidal mania. She must have forgotten--and Bailey too. I"
1047,"suspect she forgot before she married him. I don't suppose either of"
1047,"them had the slightest intimation of the dimensions sexual love can take"
1047,"in the thoughts of the great majority of people with whom they come in"
1047,"contact. They loved in their way--an intellectual way it was and a fond"
1047,"way--but it had no relation to beauty and physical sensation--except"
1047,"that there seemed a decree of exile against these things. They got their"
1047,"glow in high moments of altruistic ambition--and in moments of vivid"
1047,"worldly success. They sat at opposite ends of their dinner table with so"
1047,"and so ""captured,"" and so and so, flushed with a mutual approval. They"
1047,"saw people in love forgetful and distraught about them, and just put it"
1047,"down to forgetfulness and distraction. At any rate Altiora manifestly"
1047,"viewed my situation and Margaret's with an abnormal and entirely"
1047,"misleading simplicity. There was the girl, rich, with an acceptable"
1047,"claim to be beautiful, shiningly virtuous, quite capable of political"
1047,"interests, and there was I, talented, ambitious and full of"
1047,"political and social passion, in need of just the money, devotion and"
1047,"regularisation Margaret could provide. We were both unmarried--white"
1047,"sheets of uninscribed paper. Was there ever a simpler situation? What"
1047,"more could we possibly want?"
1047,""
1047,"She was even a little offended at the inconclusiveness that did not"
1047,"settle things at Pangbourne. I seemed to her, I suspect, to reflect upon"
1047,"her judgment and good intentions."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"7"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I didn't see things with Altiora's simplicity."
1047,""
1047,"I admired Margaret very much, I was fully aware of all that she and I"
1047,"might give each other; indeed so far as Altiora went we were quite in"
1047,"agreement. But what seemed solid ground to Altiora and the ultimate"
1047,"footing of her emasculated world, was to me just the superficial"
1047,"covering of a gulf--oh! abysses of vague and dim, and yet stupendously"
1047,"significant things."
1047,""
1047,"I couldn't dismiss the interests and the passion of sex as Altiora did."
1047,"Work, I agreed, was important; career and success; but deep unanalysable"
1047,"instincts told me this preoccupation was a thing quite as important;"
1047,"dangerous, interfering, destructive indeed, but none the less a"
1047,"dominating interest in life. I have told how flittingly and uninvited it"
1047,"came like a moth from the outer twilight into my life, how it grew in me"
1047,"with my manhood, how it found its way to speech and grew daring, and led"
1047,"me at last to experience. After that adventure at Locarno sex and the"
1047,"interests and desires of sex never left me for long at peace. I went on"
1047,"with my work and my career, and all the time it was like--like someone"
1047,"talking ever and again in a room while one tries to write."
1047,""
1047,"There were times when I could have wished the world a world all of men,"
1047,"so greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and curiosities"
1047,"hamper me; and times when I could have wished the world all of women."
1047,"I seemed always to be seeking something in women, in girls, and I"
1047,"was never clear what it was I was seeking. But never--even at my"
1047,"coarsest--was I moved by physical desire alone. Was I seeking help and"
1047,"fellowship? Was I seeking some intimacy with beauty? It was a thing too"
1047,"formless to state, that I seemed always desiring to attain and never"
1047,"attaining. Waves of gross sensuousness arose out of this preoccupation,"
1047,"carried me to a crisis of gratification or disappointment that was"
1047,"clearly not the needed thing; they passed and left my mind free again"
1047,"for a time to get on with the permanent pursuits of my life. And then"
1047,"presently this solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it"
1047,"seemed, and yet a constantly recurring demand."
1047,""
1047,"I don't want particularly to dwell upon things that are disagreeable"
1047,"for others to read, but I cannot leave them out of my story and get the"
1047,"right proportions of the forces I am balancing. I was no abnormal man,"
1047,"and that world of order we desire to make must be built of such stuff as"
1047,"I was and am and can beget. You cannot have a world of Baileys; it would"
1047,"end in one orderly generation. Humanity is begotten in Desire, lives by"
1047,"Desire."

1047,"I suppose the life of celibacy which the active, well-fed,"
1047,"well-exercised and imaginatively stirred young man of the educated"
1047,"classes is supposed to lead from the age of nineteen or twenty,"
1047,"when Nature certainly meant him to marry, to thirty or more, when"
1047,"civilisation permits him to do so, is the most impossible thing in the"
1047,"world. We deal here with facts that are kept secret and obscure, but"
1047,"I doubt for my own part if more than one man out of five in our class"
1047,"satisfies that ideal demand. The rest are even as I was, and Hatherleigh"
1047,"and Esmeer and all the men I knew. I draw no lessons and offer no"
1047,"panacea; I have to tell the quality of life, and this is how it is. This"

1047,"I was no systematic libertine, you must understand; things happened to"

1047,"adventure, and after that what had been a mystic and wonderful thing"
1047,"passed rapidly into a gross, manifestly misdirected and complicating"
1047,"one. I can count a meagre tale of five illicit loves in the days of my"
1047,"youth, to include that first experience, and of them all only two were"
1047,"sustained relationships. Besides these five ""affairs,"" on one or two"
1047,"occasions I dipped so low as the inky dismal sensuality of the streets,"
1047,"and made one of those pairs of correlated figures, the woman in her"
1047,"squalid finery sailing homeward, the man modestly aloof and behind, that"
1047,"every night in the London year flit by the score of thousands across the"

1047,"How ugly it is to recall; ugly and shameful now without qualification!"

1047,"One such occasion I recall as if it were a vision deep down in a pit,"
1047,"as if it had happened in another state of existence to someone else. And"
1047,"yet it is the sort of thing that has happened, once or twice at least,"
1047,"to half the men in London who have been in a position to make it"
1047,"possible. Let me try and give you its peculiar effect. Man or woman, you"

1047,"Figure to yourself a dingy room, somewhere in that network of streets"

1047,"closing the window, and a tawdry ornament of paper in the grate. I sit"
1047,"on a bed beside a weary-eyed, fair-haired, sturdy young woman, half"

1047,"murdered before her eyes."

1047,"It was as if one had dipped into something primordial and stupendous"

1047,"like dipping into a ragbag, one brings out this memory or that, with no"
1047,"intimation of how they came in time or what led to them and joined them"
1047,"together. And they are all mixed up with subsequent associations,"
1047,"with sympathies and discords, habits of intercourse, surprises and"
1047,"disappointments and discovered misunderstandings. I know only that"
1047,"always my feelings for Margaret were complicated feelings, woven of many"
1047,"and various strands."
1047,""
1047,"It is one of the curious neglected aspects of life how at the same time"
1047,"and in relation to the same reality we can have in our minds streams of"
1047,"thought at quite different levels. We can be at the same time idealising"
1047,"a person and seeing and criticising that person quite coldly and"
1047,"clearly, and we slip unconsciously from level to level and produce"
1047,"all sorts of inconsistent acts. In a sense I had no illusions about"
1047,"Margaret; in a sense my conception of Margaret was entirely poetic"
1047,"illusion. I don't think I was ever blind to certain defects of hers, and"
1047,"quite as certainly they didn't seem to matter in the slightest degree."
1047,"Her mind had a curious want of vigour, ""flatness"" is the only word; she"
1047,"never seemed to escape from her phrase; her way of thinking, her way of"
1047,"doing was indecisive; she remained in her attitude, it did not flow out"
1047,"to easy, confirmatory action."
1047,""
1047,"I saw this quite clearly, and when we walked and talked together I"
1047,"seemed always trying for animation in her and never finding it. I would"
1047,"state my ideas. ""I know,"" she would say, ""I know."""
1047,""
1047,"I talked about myself and she listened wonderfully, but she made no"
1047,"answering revelations. I talked politics, and she remarked with her blue"
1047,"eyes wide and earnest: ""Every WORD you say seems so just."""
1047,""
1047,"I admired her appearance tremendously but--I can only express it by"
1047,"saying I didn't want to touch her. Her fair hair was always delectably"
1047,"done. It flowed beautifully over her pretty small ears, and she would"
1047,"tie its fair coilings with fillets of black or blue velvet that carried"
1047,"pretty buckles of silver and paste. The light, the faint down on her"
1047,"brow and cheek was delightful. And it was clear to me that I made her"
1047,"happy."
1047,""
1047,"My sense of her deficiencies didn't stand in the way of my falling at"
1047,"last very deeply in love with her. Her very shortcomings seemed to offer"
1047,"me something...."
1047,""
1047,"She stood in my mind for goodness--and for things from which it seemed"
1047,"to me my hold was slipping."
1047,""
1047,"She seemed to promise a way of escape from the deepening opposition in"
1047,"me between physical passions and the constructive career, the career"
1047,"of wide aims and human service, upon which I had embarked. All the time"
1047,"that I was seeing her as a beautiful, fragile, rather ineffective girl,"
1047,"I was also seeing her just as consciously as a shining slender figure,"
1047,"a radiant reconciliation, coming into my darkling disorders of lust and"
1047,"impulse. I could understand clearly that she was incapable of the most"
1047,"necessary subtleties of political thought, and yet I could contemplate"
1047,"praying to her and putting all the intricate troubles of my life at her"
1047,"feet."
1047,""
1047,"Before the reappearance of Margaret in my world at all an unwonted"
1047,"disgust with the consequences and quality of my passions had arisen in"
1047,"my mind. Among other things that moment with the Lettish girl haunted"
1047,"me persistently. I would see myself again and again sitting amidst those"
1047,"sluttish surroundings, collar and tie in hand, while her heavy German"
1047,"words grouped themselves to a slowly apprehended meaning. I would"
1047,"feel again with a fresh stab of remorse, that this was not a flash of"
1047,"adventure, this was not seeing life in any permissible sense, but a dip"
1047,"into tragedy, dishonour, hideous degradation, and the pitiless cruelty"
1047,"of a world as yet uncontrolled by any ordered will."
1047,""
1047,"""Good God!"" I put it to myself, ""that I should finish the work those"
1047,"Cossacks had begun! I who want order and justice before everything!"
1047,"There's no way out of it, no decent excuse! If I didn't think, I ought"
1047,"to have thought!""..."
1047,""
1047,"""How did I get to it?""... I would ransack the phases of my development"
1047,"from the first shy unveiling of a hidden wonder to the last extremity as"
1047,"a man will go through muddled account books to find some disorganising"
1047,"error...."
1047,""
1047,"I was also involved at that time--I find it hard to place these things"
1047,"in the exact order of their dates because they were so disconnected"
1047,"with the regular progress of my work and life--in an intrigue, a clumsy,"
1047,"sensuous, pretentious, artificially stimulated intrigue, with a Mrs."
1047,"Larrimer, a woman living separated from her husband. I will not go"
1047,"into particulars of that episode, nor how we quarrelled and chafed one"
1047,"another. She was at once unfaithful and jealous and full of whims"
1047,"about our meetings; she was careless of our secret, and vulgarised our"
1047,"relationship by intolerable interpretations; except for some glowing"
1047,"moments of gratification, except for the recurrent and essentially"
1047,"vicious desire that drew us back to each other again, we both fretted at"
1047,"a vexatious and unexpectedly binding intimacy. The interim was full"
1047,"of the quality of work delayed, of time and energy wasted, of insecure"
1047,"precautions against scandal and exposure. Disappointment is almost"
1047,"inherent in illicit love. I had, and perhaps it was part of her"
1047,"recurrent irritation also, a feeling as though one had followed"
1047,"something fine and beautiful into a net--into bird lime! These furtive"
1047,"scuffles, this sneaking into shabby houses of assignation, was what we"
1047,"had made out of the suggestion of pagan beauty; this was the reality"
1047,"of our vision of nymphs and satyrs dancing for the joy of life amidst"
1047,"incessant sunshine. We had laid hands upon the wonder and glory of"
1047,"bodily love and wasted them...."
1047,""
1047,"It was the sense of waste, of finely beautiful possibilities getting"
1047,"entangled and marred for ever that oppressed me. I had missed, I had"
1047,"lost. I did not turn from these things after the fashion of the Baileys,"
1047,"as one turns from something low and embarrassing. I felt that these"
1047,"great organic forces were still to be wrought into a harmony with my"
1047,"constructive passion. I felt too that I was not doing it. I had not"
1047,"understood the forces in this struggle nor its nature, and as I learnt"
1047,"I failed. I had been started wrong, I had gone on wrong, in a world that"
1047,"was muddled and confused, full of false counsel and erratic shames and"
1047,"twisted temptations. I learnt to see it so by failures that were perhaps"
1047,"destroying any chance of profit in my lessons. Moods of clear keen"
1047,"industry alternated with moods of relapse and indulgence and moods of"
1047,"dubiety and remorse. I was not going on as the Baileys thought I was"
1047,"going on. There were times when the blindness of the Baileys irritated"
1047,"me intensely. Beneath the ostensible success of those years, between"
1047,"twenty-three and twenty-eight, this rottenness, known to scarcely"
1047,"any one but myself, grew and spread. My sense of the probability of"
1047,"a collapse intensified. I knew indeed now, even as Willersley had"
1047,"prophesied five years before, that I was entangling myself in something"
1047,"that might smother all my uses in the world. Down there among those"
1047,"incommunicable difficulties, I was puzzled and blundering. I was losing"
1047,"my hold upon things; the chaotic and adventurous element in life was"
1047,"spreading upward and getting the better of me, over-mastering me and all"
1047,"my will to rule and make.... And the strength, the drugging urgency of"
1047,"the passion!"
1047,""
1047,"Margaret shone at times in my imagination like a radiant angel in a"
1047,"world of mire and disorder, in a world of cravings, hot and dull red"
1047,"like scars inflamed...."
1047,""
1047,"I suppose it was because I had so great a need of such help as her"
1047,"whiteness proffered, that I could ascribe impossible perfections to"
1047,"her, a power of intellect, a moral power and patience to which she, poor"
1047,"fellow mortal, had indeed no claim. If only a few of us WERE angels and"
1047,"freed from the tangle of effort, how easy life might be! I wanted her so"
1047,"badly, so very badly, to be what I needed. I wanted a woman to save me."
1047,"I forced myself to see her as I wished to see her. Her tepidities became"
1047,"infinite delicacies, her mental vagueness an atmospheric realism. The"
1047,"harsh precisions of the Baileys and Altiora's blunt directness threw up"
1047,"her fineness into relief and made a grace of every weakness."
1047,""
1047,"Mixed up with the memory of times when I talked with Margaret as one"
1047,"talks politely to those who are hopelessly inferior in mental quality,"
1047,"explaining with a false lucidity, welcoming and encouraging the feeblest"
1047,"response, when possible moulding and directing, are times when I did"
1047,"indeed, as the old phrase goes, worship the ground she trod on. I was"
1047,"equally honest and unconscious of inconsistency at each extreme. But in"
1047,"neither phase could I find it easy to make love to Margaret. For in the"
1047,"first I did not want to, though I talked abundantly to her of marriage"
1047,"and so forth, and was a little puzzled at myself for not going on to"
1047,"some personal application, and in the second she seemed inaccessible, I"
1047,"felt I must make confessions and put things before her that would be the"
1047,"grossest outrage upon the noble purity I attributed to her."

1047,"I went to Margaret at last to ask her to marry me, wrought up to the"
1047,"mood of one who stakes his life on a cast. Separated from her, and with"
1047,"the resonance of an evening of angry recriminations with Mrs. Larrimer"
1047,"echoing in my mind, I discovered myself to be quite passionately in"
1047,"love with Margaret. Last shreds of doubt vanished. It has always been a"
1047,"feature of our relationship that Margaret absent means more to me than"
1047,"Margaret present; her memory distils from its dross and purifies in"
1047,"me. All my criticisms and qualifications of her vanished into some dark"
1047,"corner of my mind. She was the lady of my salvation; I must win my way"
1047,"to her or perish."
1047,""
1047,"I went to her at last, for all that I knew she loved me, in passionate"
1047,"self-abasement, white and a-tremble. She was staying with the Rockleys"
1047,"at Woking, for Shena Rockley had been at Bennett Hall with her and they"
1047,"had resumed a close intimacy; and I went down to her on an impulse,"
1047,"unheralded. I was kept waiting for some minutes, I remember, in a little"
1047,"room upon which a conservatory opened, a conservatory full of pots"
1047,"of large mauve-edged, white cyclamens in flower. And there was a big"
1047,"lacquer cabinet, a Chinese thing, I suppose, of black and gold against"
1047,"the red-toned wall. To this day the thought of Margaret is inseparably"
1047,"bound up with the sight of a cyclamen's back-turned petals."
1047,""
1047,"She came in, looking pale and drooping rather more than usual. I"
1047,"suddenly realised that Altiora's hint of a disappointment leading to"
1047,"positive illness was something more than a vindictive comment. She"
1047,"closed the door and came across to me and took and dropped my hand and"
1047,"stood still. ""What is it you want with me?"" she asked."
1047,""
1047,"The speech I had been turning over and over in my mind on the way"
1047,"vanished at the sight of her."
1047,""
1047,"""I want to talk to you,"" I answered lamely."
1047,""
1047,"For some seconds neither of us said a word."
1047,""
1047,"""I want to tell you things about my life,"" I began."
1047,""
1047,"She answered with a scarcely audible ""yes."""
1047,""
1047,"""I almost asked you to marry me at Pangbourne,"" I plunged. ""I didn't. I"
1047,"didn't because--because you had too much to give me."""
1047,""
1047,"""Too much!"" she echoed, ""to give you!"" She had lifted her eyes to my"
1047,"face and the colour was coming into her cheeks."
1047,""
1047,"""Don't misunderstand me,"" I said hastily. ""I want to tell you things,"
1047,"things you don't know. Don't answer me. I want to tell you."""
1047,""
1047,"She stood before the fireplace with her ultimate answer shining through"
1047,"the quiet of her face. ""Go on,"" she said, very softly. It was so"
1047,"pitilessly manifest she was resolved to idealise the situation whatever"
1047,"I might say. I began walking up and down the room between those"
1047,"cyclamens and the cabinet. There were little gold fishermen on the"
1047,"cabinet fishing from little islands that each had a pagoda and a tree,"
1047,"and there were also men in boats or something, I couldn't determine"
1047,"what, and some obscure sub-office in my mind concerned itself with that"
1047,"quite intently. Yet I seem to have been striving with all my being"
1047,"to get words for the truth of things. ""You see,"" I emerged, ""you make"
1047,"everything possible to me. You can give me help and sympathy, support,"
1047,"understanding. You know my political ambitions. You know all that I"
1047,"might do in the world. I do so intensely want to do constructive things,"
1047,"big things perhaps, in this wild jumble.... Only you don't know a bit"
1047,"what I am. I want to tell you what I am. I'm complex.... I'm streaked."""

1047,"I glanced at her, and she was regarding me with an expression of"
1047,"blissful disregard for any meaning I was seeking to convey."
1047,""
1047,"""You see,"" I said, ""I'm a bad man."""

1047,"Everything seemed to be slipping away from me. I pushed on to the ugly"
1047,"facts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation. ""What"
1047,"has held me back,"" I said, ""is the thought that you could not possibly"
1047,"understand certain things in my life. Men are not pure as women are. I"
1047,"have had love affairs. I mean I have had affairs. Passion--desire. You"
1047,"see, I have had a mistress, I have been entangled--"""
1047,""
1047,"She seemed about to speak, but I interrupted. ""I'm not telling you,"" I"
1047,"said, ""what I meant to tell you. I want you to know clearly that there"
1047,"is another side to my life, a dirty side. Deliberately I say, dirty. It"
1047,"didn't seem so at first--"""

1047,"I stopped blankly. ""Dirty,"" I thought, was the most idiotic choice of"
1047,"words to have made."

1047,"I had never in any tolerable sense of the word been dirty."

1047,"She looked up and smiled as though we had exchanged some acceptable"
1047,"commonplaces. ""Poor dear!"" she said, dismissing everything, and put out"
1047,"her arms, and it seemed to me that I could hear the Lettish girl in"
1047,"the background--doomed safety valve of purity in this intolerable"
1047,"world--telling something in indistinguishable German--I know not what"
1047,"nor why...."

1047,"There comes into my mind a confused memory of conversations with"
1047,"Margaret; we must have had dozens altogether, and they mix in now for"
1047,"the most part inextricably not only with one another, but with later"
1047,"talks and with things we discussed at Pangbourne. We had the immensest"
1047,"anticipations of the years and opportunities that lay before us. I was"
1047,"now very deeply in love with her indeed. I felt not that I had cleaned"
1047,"up my life but that she had. We called each other ""confederate"" I"
1047,"remember, and made during our brief engagement a series of visits to the"
1047,"various legislative bodies in London, the County Council, the House of"
1047,"Commons, where we dined with Villiers, and the St. Pancras Vestry, where"
1047,"we heard Shaw speaking. I was full of plans and so was she of the way"
1047,"in which we were to live and work. We were to pay back in public service"
1047,"whatever excess of wealth beyond his merits old Seddon's economic"
1047,"advantage had won for him from the toiling people in the potteries. The"
1047,"end of the Boer War was so recent that that blessed word ""efficiency"""
1047,"echoed still in people's minds and thoughts. Lord Roseberry in a"
1047,"memorable oration had put it into the heads of the big outer public, but"
1047,"the Baileys with a certain show of justice claimed to have set it going"
1047,"in the channels that took it to him--if as a matter of fact it was taken"
1047,"to him. But then it was their habit to make claims of that sort. They"
1047,"certainly did their share to keep ""efficient"" going. Altiora's"
1047,"highest praise was ""thoroughly efficient."" We were to be a ""thoroughly"
1047,"efficient"" political couple of the ""new type."" She explained us to"
1047,"herself and Oscar, she explained us to ourselves, she explained us to"
1047,"the people who came to her dinners and afternoons until the world was"
1047,"highly charged with explanation and expectation, and the proposal that I"
1047,"should be the Liberal candidate for the Kinghamstead Division seemed the"
1047,"most natural development in the world."
1047,""
1047,"I was full of the ideal of hard restrained living and relentless"
1047,"activity, and throughout a beautiful November at Venice, where chiefly"
1047,"we spent our honeymoon, we turned over and over again and discussed in"
1047,"every aspect our conception of a life tremendously focussed upon the"
1047,"ideal of social service."
1047,""
1047,"Most clearly there stands out a picture of ourselves talking in a"
1047,"gondola on our way to Torcella. Far away behind us the smoke of Murano"
1047,"forms a black stain upon an immense shining prospect of smooth water,"
1047,"water as unruffled and luminous as the sky above, a mirror on which rows"
1047,"of posts and distant black high-stemmed, swan-necked boats with their"
1047,"minutely clear swinging gondoliers, float aerially. Remote and low"
1047,"before us rises the little tower of our destination. Our men swing"
1047,"together and their oars swirl leisurely through the water, hump back in"
1047,"the rowlocks, splash sharply and go swishing back again. Margaret lies"
1047,"back on cushions, with her face shaded by a holland parasol, and I sit"
1047,"up beside her."

1047,"""You see,"" I say, and in spite of Margaret's note of perfect"

1047,"something priggish in a meticulous discipline, but otherwise it is"
1047,"so easy to slip into indolent habits--and to be distracted from one's"
1047,"purpose. The country, the world, wants men to serve its constructive"
1047,"needs, to work out and carry out plans. For a man who has to make a"

1047,"discontinuous with all about it. The faded quality of the very sunshine"
1047,"of that season, the mellow discoloured palaces and places, the huge,"
1047,"time-ripened paintings of departed splendours, the whispering, nearly"
1047,"noiseless passage of hearse-black gondolas, for the horrible steam"
1047,"launch had not yet ruined Venice, the stilled magnificences of the"
1047,"depopulated lagoons, the universal autumn, made me feel altogether in"
1047,"recess from the teeming uproars of reality. There was not a dozen people"
1047,"all told, no Americans and scarcely any English, to dine in the big"
1047,"cavern of a dining-room, with its vistas of separate tables, its"
1047,"distempered walls and its swathed chandeliers. We went about seeing"
1047,"beautiful things, accepting beauty on every hand, and taking it for"
1047,"granted that all was well with ourselves and the world. It was ten days"

1047,"tranquillity for such a temperament as mine."

1047,"Our pleasures were curiously impersonal, a succession of shared"

1047,"out. It was entirely in my conception of things that I should be very"
1047,"watchful not to shock or distress Margaret or press the sensuous note."

1047,"journey--fear of the mosquito had driven her mother across Italy to the"
1047,"westward route--and now she could fill up her gaps and see the Titians"
1047,"and Paul Veroneses she already knew in colourless photographs, the"
1047,"Carpaccios, (the St. George series delighted her beyond measure,)"
1047,"the Basaitis and that great statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni that Ruskin"
1047,"praised."
1047,""
1047,"But since I am not a man to look at pictures and architectural effects"
1047,"day after day, I did watch Margaret very closely and store a thousand"
1047,"memories of her. I can see her now, her long body drooping a little"
1047,"forward, her sweet face upraised to some discovered familiar masterpiece"
1047,"and shining with a delicate enthusiasm. I can hear again the soft"
1047,"cadences of her voice murmuring commonplace comments, for she had no"
1047,"gift of expressing the shapeless satisfaction these things gave her."
1047,""
1047,"Margaret, I perceived, was a cultivated person, the first cultivated"
1047,"person with whom I had ever come into close contact. She was cultivated"
1047,"and moral, and I, I now realise, was never either of these things. She"
1047,"was passive, and I am active. She did not simply and naturally look"
1047,"for beauty but she had been incited to look for it at school, and took"
1047,"perhaps a keener interest in books and lectures and all the organisation"
1047,"of beautiful things than she did in beauty itself; she found much of her"
1047,"delight in being guided to it. Now a thing ceases to be beautiful to me"
1047,"when some finger points me out its merits. Beauty is the salt of life,"
1047,"but I take my beauty as a wild beast gets its salt, as a constituent of"
1047,"the meal...."
1047,""
1047,"And besides, there was that between us that should have seemed more"
1047,"beautiful than any picture...."
1047,""
1047,"So we went about Venice tracking down pictures and spiral staircases and"
1047,"such-like things, and my brains were busy all the time with such things"
1047,"as a comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent, New York,"
1047,"with the elaboration of schemes of action when we returned to London,"
1047,"with the development of a theory of Margaret."
1047,""
1047,"Our marriage had done this much at least, that it had fused and"
1047,"destroyed those two independent ways of thinking about her that had gone"
1047,"on in my mind hitherto. Suddenly she had become very near to me, and a"
1047,"very big thing, a sort of comprehensive generalisation behind a thousand"
1047,"questions, like the sky or England. The judgments and understandings"
1047,"that had worked when she was, so to speak, miles away from my life,"
1047,"had now to be altogether revised. Trifling things began to matter"
1047,"enormously, that she had a weak and easily fatigued back, for example,"
1047,"or that when she knitted her brows and stammered a little in talking,"
1047,"it didn't really mean that an exquisite significance struggled for"
1047,"utterance."
1047,""
1047,"We visited pictures in the mornings chiefly. In the afternoon, unless we"
1047,"were making a day-long excursion in a gondola, Margaret would rest for"
1047,"an hour while I prowled about in search of English newspapers, and then"
1047,"we would go to tea in the Piazza San Marco and watch the drift of people"
1047,"feeding the pigeons and going into the little doors beneath the sunlit"
1047,"arches and domes of Saint Mark's. Then perhaps we would stroll on the"
1047,"Piazzetta, or go out into the sunset in a gondola. Margaret became very"
1047,"interested in the shops that abound under the colonnades and decided at"
1047,"last to make an extensive purchase of table glass. ""These things,"" she"
1047,"said, ""are quite beautiful, and far cheaper than anything but the most"
1047,"ordinary looking English ware."" I was interested in her idea, and a good"
1047,"deal charmed by the delightful qualities of tinted shape, slender handle"
1047,"and twisted stem. I suggested we should get not simply tumblers"
1047,"and wineglasses but bedroom waterbottles, fruit- and sweet-dishes,"
1047,"water-jugs, and in the end we made quite a business-like afternoon of"
1047,"it."
1047,""
1047,"I was beginning now to long quite definitely for events. Energy was"
1047,"accumulating in me, and worrying me for an outlet. I found the TIMES and"
1047,"the DAILY TELEGRAPH and the other papers I managed to get hold of, more"
1047,"and more stimulating. I nearly wrote to the former paper one day in"
1047,"answer to a letter by Lord Grimthorpe--I forget now upon what point."
1047,"I chafed secretly against this life of tranquil appreciations more and"
1047,"more. I found my attitudes of restrained and delicate affection for"
1047,"Margaret increasingly difficult to sustain. I surprised myself and her"
1047,"by little gusts of irritability, gusts like the catspaws before a gale."
1047,"I was alarmed at these symptoms."
1047,""
1047,"One night when Margaret had gone up to her room, I put on a light"
1047,"overcoat, went out into the night and prowled for a long time through"
1047,"the narrow streets, smoking and thinking. I returned and went and sat on"
1047,"the edge of her bed to talk to her."
1047,""
1047,"""Look here, Margaret,"" I said; ""this is all very well, but I'm"
1047,"restless."""
1047,""
1047,"""Restless!"" she said with a faint surprise in her voice."
1047,""
1047,"""Yes. I think I want exercise. I've got a sort of feeling--I've never"
1047,"had it before--as though I was getting fat."""
1047,""
1047,"""My dear!"" she cried."
1047,""
1047,"""I want to do things;--ride horses, climb mountains, take the devil out"
1047,"of myself."""
1047,""
1047,"She watched me thoughtfully."
1047,""
1047,"""Couldn't we DO something?"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"Do what?"
1047,""
1047,"""I don't know. Couldn't we perhaps go away from here soon--and walk in"
1047,"the mountains--on our way home."""
1047,""
1047,"I thought. ""There seems to be no exercise at all in this place."""
1047,""
1047,"""Isn't there some walk?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I wonder,"" I answered. ""We might walk to Chioggia perhaps, along"
1047,"the Lido."" And we tried that, but the long stretch of beach fatigued"
1047,"Margaret's back, and gave her blisters, and we never got beyond"
1047,"Malamocco...."
1047,""
1047,"A day or so after we went out to those pleasant black-robed, bearded"
1047,"Armenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards"
1047,"sundown. We fell into silence. ""PIU LENTO,"" said Margaret to the"
1047,"gondolier, and released my accumulated resolution."
1047,""
1047,"""Let us go back to London,"" I said abruptly."
1047,""
1047,"Margaret looked at me with surprised blue eyes."
1047,""
1047,"""This is beautiful beyond measure, you know,"" I said, sticking to my"
1047,"point, ""but I have work to do."""
1047,""
1047,"She was silent for some seconds. ""I had forgotten,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"""So had I,"" I sympathised, and took her hand. ""Suddenly I have"
1047,"remembered."""
1047,""
1047,"She remained quite still. ""There is so much to be done,"" I said, almost"
1047,"apologetically."
1047,""
1047,"She looked long away from me across the lagoon and at last sighed, like"
1047,"one who has drunk deeply, and turned to me."
1047,""
1047,"""I suppose one ought not to be so happy,"" she said. ""Everything has been"
1047,"so beautiful and so simple and splendid. And clean. It has been just"
1047,"With You--the time of my life. It's a pity such things must end. But"
1047,"the world is calling you, dear.... I ought not to have forgotten it. I"
1047,"thought you were resting--and thinking. But if you are rested.--Would"
1047,"you like us to start to-morrow?"""
1047,""
1047,"She looked at once so fragile and so devoted that on the spur of the"
1047,"moment I relented, and we stayed in Venice four more days."

1047,"CHAPTER THE FOURTH ~~ THE HOUSE IN WESTMINSTER"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"1"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"Margaret had already taken a little house in Radnor Square, Westminster,"
1047,"before our marriage, a house that seemed particularly adaptable to our"
1047,"needs as public-spirited efficients; it had been very pleasantly painted"
1047,"and papered under Margaret's instructions, white paint and clean open"
1047,"purples and green predominating, and now we set to work at once upon"
1047,"the interesting business of arranging and--with our Venetian glass as a"
1047,"beginning--furnishing it. We had been fairly fortunate with our wedding"
1047,"presents, and for the most part it was open to us to choose just exactly"
1047,"what we would have and just precisely where we would put it."
1047,""
1047,"Margaret had a sense of form and colour altogether superior to mine, and"
1047,"so quite apart from the fact that it was her money equipped us, I stood"
1047,"aside from all these matters and obeyed her summons to a consultation"
1047,"only to endorse her judgment very readily. Until everything was settled"
1047,"I went every day to my old rooms in Vincent Square and worked at a"
1047,"series of papers that were originally intended for the FORTNIGHTLY"
1047,"REVIEW, the papers that afterwards became my fourth book, ""New Aspects"
1047,"of Liberalism."""
1047,""
1047,"I still remember as delightful most of the circumstances of getting"
1047,"into 79, Radnor Square. The thin flavour of indecision about Margaret"
1047,"disappeared altogether in a shop; she had the precisest ideas of what"
1047,"she wanted, and the devices of the salesman did not sway her. It was"
1047,"very pleasant to find her taking things out of my hands with a certain"
1047,"masterfulness, and showing the distinctest determination to make a"
1047,"house in which I should be able to work in that great project of ""doing"
1047,"something for the world."""
1047,""
1047,"""And I do want to make things pretty about us,"" she said. ""You don't"
1047,"think it wrong to have things pretty?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I want them so."""
1047,""
1047,"""Altiora has things hard."""
1047,""
1047,"""Altiora,"" I answered, ""takes a pride in standing ugly and uncomfortable"
1047,"things. But I don't see that they help her. Anyhow they won't help me."""
1047,""
1047,"So Margaret went to the best shops and got everything very simple and"
1047,"very good. She bought some pictures very well indeed; there was a little"
1047,"Sussex landscape, full of wind and sunshine, by Nicholson, for my study,"
1047,"that hit my taste far better than if I had gone out to get some such"
1047,"expression for myself."
1047,""
1047,"""We will buy a picture just now and then,"" she said, ""sometimes--when we"
1047,"see one."""
1047,""
1047,"I would come back through the January mire or fog from Vincent Square to"
1047,"the door of 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish appreciation"
1047,"of the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its fine brass"
1047,"furnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey and discover"
1047,"Margaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a partially opened"
1047,"packing-case, fatigued but happy, or go up to have tea with her out"
1047,"of the right tea things, ""come at last,"" or be told to notice what was"
1047,"fresh there. It wasn't simply that I had never had a house before, but"
1047,"I had really never been, except in the most transitory way, in any house"
1047,"that was nearly so delightful as mine promised to be. Everything was"
1047,"fresh and bright, and softly and harmoniously toned. Downstairs we had"
1047,"a green dining-room with gleaming silver, dark oak, and English"
1047,"colour-prints; above was a large drawing-room that could be made still"
1047,"larger by throwing open folding doors, and it was all carefully done in"
1047,"greys and blues, for the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by"
1047,"Sheraton so skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as"
1047,"to be indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above"
1047,"this and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially"
1047,"thick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead and"
1047,"a big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and window, and"
1047,"another desk specially made for me by that expert if I chose to"
1047,"stand and write, and open bookshelves and bookcases and every sort of"
1047,"convenient fitting. There were electric heaters beside the open fire,"
1047,"and everything was put for me to make tea at any time--electric kettle,"
1047,"infuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so that I could get up and work at"
1047,"any hour of the day or night. I could do no work in this apartment for"
1047,"a long time, I was so interested in the perfection of its arrangements."
1047,"And when I brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret"
1047,"seized upon all the really shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a"
1047,"fine official-looking leather."
1047,""
1047,"I can remember sitting down at that desk and looking round me and"
1047,"feeling with a queer effect of surprise that after all even a place"
1047,"in the Cabinet, though infinitely remote, was nevertheless in the same"
1047,"large world with these fine and quietly expensive things."
1047,""
1047,"On the same floor Margaret had a ""den,"" a very neat and pretty den with"
1047,"good colour-prints of Botticellis and Carpaccios, and there was a third"
1047,"apartment for sectarial purposes should the necessity for them arise,"
1047,"with a severe-looking desk equipped with patent files. And Margaret"
1047,"would come flitting into the room to me, or appear noiselessly"
1047,"standing, a tall gracefully drooping form, in the wide open doorway. ""Is"
1047,"everything right, dear?"" she would ask."
1047,""
1047,"""Come in,"" I would say, ""I'm sorting out papers."""
1047,""
1047,"She would come to the hearthrug."
1047,""
1047,"""I mustn't disturb you,"" she would remark."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm not busy yet."""
1047,""
1047,"""Things are getting into order. Then we must make out a time-table as"
1047,"the Baileys do, and BEGIN!"""
1047,""
1047,"Altiora came in to see us once or twice, and a number of serious"
1047,"young wives known to Altiora called and were shown over the house, and"
1047,"discussed its arrangements with Margaret. They were all tremendously"
1047,"keen on efficient arrangements."
1047,""
1047,"""A little pretty,"" said Altiora, with the faintest disapproval,"
1047,"""still--"""
1047,""
1047,"It was clear she thought we should grow out of that. From the day of our"
1047,"return we found other people's houses open to us and eager for us. We"
1047,"went out of London for week-ends and dined out, and began discussing"
1047,"our projects for reciprocating these hospitalities. As a single man"
1047,"unattached, I had had a wide and miscellaneous social range, but now"
1047,"I found myself falling into place in a set. For a time I acquiesced"
1047,"in this. I went very little to my clubs, the Climax and the National"
1047,"Liberal, and participated in no bachelor dinners at all. For a time,"
1047,"too, I dropped out of the garrulous literary and journalistic circles I"
1047,"had frequented. I put up for the Reform, not so much for the use of the"
1047,"club as a sign of serious and substantial political standing. I didn't"
1047,"go up to Cambridge, I remember, for nearly a year, so occupied was I"
1047,"with my new adjustments."
1047,""
1047,"The people we found ourselves among at this time were people, to put"
1047,"it roughly, of the Parliamentary candidate class, or people already"
1047,"actually placed in the political world. They ranged between very"
1047,"considerable wealth and such a hard, bare independence as old Willersley"
1047,"and the sister who kept house for him possessed. There were quite"
1047,"a number of young couples like ourselves, a little younger and more"
1047,"artless, or a little older and more established. Among the younger men"
1047,"I had a sort of distinction because of my Cambridge reputation and my"
1047,"writing, and because, unlike them, I was an adventurer and had won and"
1047,"married my way into their circles instead of being naturally there. They"
1047,"couldn't quite reckon upon what I should do; they felt I had reserves of"
1047,"experience and incalculable traditions. Close to us were the Cramptons,"
1047,"Willie Crampton, who has since been Postmaster-General, rich and"
1047,"very important in Rockshire, and his younger brother Edward, who has"
1047,"specialised in history and become one of those unimaginative men of"
1047,"letters who are the glory of latter-day England. Then there was Lewis,"
1047,"further towards Kensington, where his cousins the Solomons and the"
1047,"Hartsteins lived, a brilliant representative of his race, able,"
1047,"industrious and invariably uninspired, with a wife a little in revolt"
1047,"against the racial tradition of feminine servitude and inclined to the"
1047,"suffragette point of view, and Bunting Harblow, an old blue, and with an"
1047,"erratic disposition well under the control of the able little cousin he"
1047,"had married. I had known all these men, but now (with Altiora floating"
1047,"angelically in benediction) they opened their hearts to me and took"
1047,"me into their order. They were all like myself, prospective Liberal"
1047,"candidates, with a feeling that the period of wandering in the"
1047,"wilderness of opposition was drawing near its close. They were all"
1047,"tremendously keen upon social and political service, and all greatly"
1047,"under the sway of the ideal of a simple, strenuous life, a life finding"
1047,"its satisfactions in political achievements and distinctions. The young"
1047,"wives were as keen about it as the young husbands, Margaret most of"
1047,"all, and I--whatever elements in me didn't march with the attitudes and"
1047,"habits of this set were very much in the background during that time."
1047,""
1047,"We would give little dinners and have evening gatherings at which"
1047,"everything was very simple and very good, with a slight but perceptible"
1047,"austerity, and there was more good fruit and flowers and less perhaps in"
1047,"the way of savouries, patties and entrees than was customary. Sherry we"
1047,"banished, and Marsala and liqueurs, and there was always good home-made"
1047,"lemonade available. No men waited, but very expert parlourmaids. Our"
1047,"meat was usually Welsh mutton--I don't know why, unless that mountains"
1047,"have ever been the last refuge of the severer virtues. And we talked"
1047,"politics and books and ideas and Bernard Shaw (who was a department by"
1047,"himself and supposed in those days to be ethically sound at bottom),"
1047,"and mingled with the intellectuals--I myself was, as it were, a promoted"
1047,"intellectual."
1047,""
1047,"The Cramptons had a tendency to read good things aloud on their less"
1047,"frequented receptions, but I have never been able to participate"
1047,"submissively in this hyper-digestion of written matter, and generally"
1047,"managed to provoke a disruptive debate. We were all very earnest to make"
1047,"the most of ourselves and to be and do, and I wonder still at times,"
1047,"with an unassuaged perplexity, how it is that in that phase of utmost"
1047,"earnestness I have always seemed to myself to be most remote from"
1047,"reality."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I look back now across the detaching intervention of sixteen crowded"
1047,"years, critically and I fancy almost impartially, to those beginnings"
1047,"of my married life. I try to recall something near to their proper order"
1047,"the developing phases of relationship. I am struck most of all by the"
1047,"immense unpremeditated, generous-spirited insincerities upon which"
1047,"Margaret and I were building."
1047,""
1047,"It seems to me that here I have to tell perhaps the commonest experience"
1047,"of all among married educated people, the deliberate, shy, complex"
1047,"effort to fill the yawning gaps in temperament as they appear, the"
1047,"sustained, failing attempt to bridge abysses, level barriers, evade"
1047,"violent pressures. I have come these latter years of my life to believe"
1047,"that it is possible for a man and woman to be absolutely real with one"
1047,"another, to stand naked souled to each other, unashamed and unafraid,"
1047,"because of the natural all-glorifying love between them. It is possible"
1047,"to love and be loved untroubling, as a bird flies through the air. But"
1047,"it is a rare and intricate chance that brings two people within sight of"
1047,"that essential union, and for the majority marriage must adjust itself"
1047,"on other terms. Most coupled people never really look at one another."
1047,"They look a little away to preconceived ideas. And each from the first"
1047,"days of love-making HIDES from the other, is afraid of disappointing,"
1047,"afraid of offending, afraid of discoveries in either sense. They build"
1047,"not solidly upon the rock of truth, but upon arches and pillars and"
1047,"queer provisional supports that are needed to make a common foundation,"
1047,"and below in the imprisoned darknesses, below the fine fabric they"
1047,"sustain together begins for each of them a cavernous hidden life. Down"
1047,"there things may be prowling that scarce ever peep out to consciousness"
1047,"except in the grey half-light of sleepless nights, passions that flash"
1047,"out for an instant in an angry glance and are seen no more, starved"
1047,"victims and beautiful dreams bricked up to die. For the most of us there"
1047,"is no jail delivery of those inner depths, and the life above goes on to"
1047,"its honourable end."
1047,""
1047,"I have told how I loved Margaret and how I came to marry her. Perhaps"
1047,"already unintentionally I have indicated the quality of the injustice"
1047,"our marriage did us both. There was no kindred between us and no"
1047,"understanding. We were drawn to one another by the unlikeness of our"
1047,"quality, by the things we misunderstood in each other. I know a score of"
1047,"couples who have married in that fashion."
1047,""
1047,"Modern conditions and modern ideas, and in particular the intenser and"
1047,"subtler perceptions of modern life, press more and more heavily upon a"
1047,"marriage tie whose fashion comes from an earlier and less discriminating"
1047,"time. When the wife was her husband's subordinate, meeting him simply"
1047,"and uncritically for simple ends, when marriage was a purely domestic"
1047,"relationship, leaving thought and the vivid things of life"
1047,"almost entirely to the unencumbered man, mental and temperamental"
1047,"incompatibilities mattered comparatively little. But now the wife,"
1047,"and particularly the loving childless wife, unpremeditatedly makes a"
1047,"relentless demand for a complete association, and the husband exacts"
1047,"unthought of delicacies of understanding and co-operation. These are"
1047,"stupendous demands. People not only think more fully and elaborately"
1047,"about life than they ever did before, but marriage obliges us to make"
1047,"that ever more accidented progress a three-legged race of carelessly"
1047,"assorted couples...."
1047,""
1047,"Our very mental texture was different. I was rough-minded, to use the"
1047,"phrase of William James, primary and intuitive and illogical; she was"
1047,"tender-minded, logical, refined and secondary. She was loyal to"
1047,"pledge and persons, sentimental and faithful; I am loyal to ideas"
1047,"and instincts, emotional and scheming. My imagination moves in broad"
1047,"gestures; her's was delicate with a real dread of extravagance. My"
1047,"quality is sensuous and ruled by warm impulses; hers was discriminating"
1047,"and essentially inhibitory. I like the facts of the case and to mention"
1047,"everything; I like naked bodies and the jolly smells of things. She"
1047,"abounded in reservations, in circumlocutions and evasions, in keenly"
1047,"appreciated secondary points. Perhaps the reader knows that Tintoretto"
1047,"in the National Gallery, the Origin of the Milky Way. It is an admirable"
1047,"test of temperamental quality. In spite of my early training I have"
1047,"come to regard that picture as altogether delightful; to Margaret it"
1047,"has always been ""needlessly offensive."" In that you have our fundamental"
1047,"breach. She had a habit, by no means rare, of damning what she did not"
1047,"like or find sympathetic in me on the score that it was not my ""true"
1047,"self,"" and she did not so much accept the universe as select from it and"
1047,"do her best to ignore the rest. And also I had far more initiative than"
1047,"had she. This is no catalogue of rights and wrongs, or superiorities"
1047,"and inferiorities; it is a catalogue of differences between two people"
1047,"linked in a relationship that constantly becomes more intolerant of"
1047,"differences."
1047,""
1047,"This is how we stood to each other, and none of it was clear to either"
1047,"of us at the outset. To begin with, I found myself reserving myself"
1047,"from her, then slowly apprehending a jarring between our minds and"
1047,"what seemed to me at first a queer little habit of misunderstanding in"
1047,"her...."
1047,""
1047,"It did not hinder my being very fond of her...."
1047,""
1047,"Where our system of reservation became at once most usual and most"
1047,"astounding was in our personal relations. It is not too much to say that"
1047,"in that regard we never for a moment achieved sincerity with one another"
1047,"during the first six years of our life together. It goes even deeper"
1047,"than that, for in my effort to realise the ideal of my marriage I ceased"
1047,"even to attempt to be sincere with myself. I would not admit my own"
1047,"perceptions and interpretations. I tried to fit myself to her thinner"
1047,"and finer determinations. There are people who will say with a note"
1047,"of approval that I was learning to conquer myself. I record that much"
1047,"without any note of approval...."
1047,""
1047,"For some years I never deceived Margaret about any concrete fact nor,"
1047,"except for the silence about my earlier life that she had almost forced"
1047,"upon me, did I hide any concrete fact that seemed to affect her, but"
1047,"from the outset I was guilty of immense spiritual concealments, my very"
1047,"marriage was based, I see now, on a spiritual subterfuge; I hid moods"
1047,"from her, pretended feelings...."

1047,"The interest and excitement of setting-up a house, of walking about"
1047,"it from room to room and from floor to floor, or sitting at one's own"
1047,"dinner table and watching one's wife control conversation with a pretty,"
1047,"timid resolution, of taking a place among the secure and free people of"
1047,"our world, passed almost insensibly into the interest and excitement"
1047,"of my Parliamentary candidature for the Kinghamstead Division, that"
1047,"shapeless chunk of agricultural midland between the Great Western and"
1047,"the North Western railways. I was going to ""take hold"" at last, the"
1047,"Kinghamstead Division was my appointed handle. I was to find my place in"
1047,"the rather indistinctly sketched constructions that were implicit in the"
1047,"minds of all our circle. The precise place I had to fill and the precise"
1047,"functions I had to discharge were not as yet very clear, but all that,"
1047,"we felt sure, would become plain as things developed."
1047,""
1047,"A few brief months of vague activities of ""nursing"" gave place to"
1047,"the excitements of the contest that followed the return of Mr."
1047,"Camphell-Bannerman to power in 1905. So far as the Kinghamstead Division"
1047,"was concerned it was a depressed and tepid battle. I went about the"
1047,"constituency making three speeches that were soon threadbare, and an"
1047,"odd little collection of people worked for me; two solicitors, a cheap"
1047,"photographer, a democratic parson, a number of dissenting ministers, the"
1047,"Mayor of Kinghamstead, a Mrs. Bulger, the widow of an old Chartist who"
1047,"had grown rich through electric traction patents, Sir Roderick Newton,"
1047,"a Jew who had bought Calersham Castle, and old Sir Graham Rivers, that"
1047,"sturdy old soldier, were among my chief supporters. We had headquarters"
1047,"in each town and village, mostly there were empty shops we leased"
1047,"temporarily, and there at least a sort of fuss and a coming and going"
1047,"were maintained. The rest of the population stared in a state of"
1047,"suspended judgment as we went about the business. The country was"
1047,"supposed to be in a state of intellectual conflict and deliberate"
1047,"decision, in history it will no doubt figure as a momentous conflict."
1047,"Yet except for an occasional flare of bill-sticking or a bill in a"
1047,"window or a placard-plastered motor-car or an argumentative group"
1047,"of people outside a public-house or a sluggish movement towards the"
1047,"schoolroom or village hall, there was scarcely a sign that a great"
1047,"empire was revising its destinies. Now and then one saw a canvasser on"
1047,"a doorstep. For the most part people went about their business with an"
1047,"entirely irresponsible confidence in the stability of the universe. At"
1047,"times one felt a little absurd with one's flutter of colours and one's"
1047,"air of saving the country."
1047,""
1047,"My opponent was a quite undistinguished Major-General who relied upon"
1047,"his advocacy of Protection, and was particularly anxious we should avoid"
1047,"""personalities"" and fight the constituency in a gentlemanly spirit. He"
1047,"was always writing me notes, apologising for excesses on the part of his"
1047,"supporters, or pointing out the undesirability of some course taken by"
1047,"mine."
1047,""
1047,"My speeches had been planned upon broad lines, but they lost touch with"
1047,"these as the polling approached. To begin with I made a real attempt"
1047,"to put what was in my mind before the people I was to supply with"
1047,"a political voice. I spoke of the greatness of our empire and its"
1047,"destinies, of the splendid projects and possibilities of life and order"
1047,"that lay before the world, of all that a resolute and constructive"
1047,"effort might do at the present time. ""We are building a state,"" I said,"
1047,"""secure and splendid, we are in the dawn of the great age of mankind."""
1047,"Sometimes that would get a solitary ""'Ear! 'ear!"" Then having created,"
1047,"as I imagined, a fine atmosphere, I turned upon the history of the last"
1047,"Conservative administration and brought it into contrast with the wide"
1047,"occasions of the age; discussed its failure to control the grasping"
1047,"financiers in South Africa, its failure to release public education from"
1047,"sectarian squabbles, its misconduct of the Boer War, its waste of the"
1047,"world's resources...."
1047,""
1047,"It soon became manifest that my opening and my general spaciousness of"
1047,"method bored my audiences a good deal. The richer and wider my phrases"
1047,"the thinner sounded my voice in these non-resonating gatherings. Even"
1047,"the platform supporters grew restive unconsciously, and stirred and"
1047,"coughed. They did not recognise themselves as mankind. Building an"
1047,"empire, preparing a fresh stage in the history of humanity, had no"
1047,"appeal for them. They were mostly everyday, toiling people, full of"
1047,"small personal solicitudes, and they came to my meetings, I think, very"
1047,"largely as a relaxation. This stuff was not relaxing. They did not think"
1047,"politics was a great constructive process, they thought it was a kind"
1047,"of dog-fight. They wanted fun, they wanted spice, they wanted hits,"
1047,"they wanted also a chance to say ""'Ear', 'ear!"" in an intelligent and"
1047,"honourable manner and clap their hands and drum with their feet. The"
1047,"great constructive process in history gives so little scope for clapping"
1047,"and drumming and saying ""'Ear, 'ear!"" One might as well think of"
1047,"hounding on the solar system."
1047,""
1047,"So after one or two attempts to lift my audiences to the level of the"
1047,"issues involved, I began to adapt myself to them. I cut down my review"
1047,"of our imperial outlook and destinies more and more, and"
1047,"developed a series of hits and anecdotes and--what shall I call"
1047,"them?--""crudifications"" of the issue. My helper's congratulated me on"
1047,"the rapid improvement of my platform style. I ceased to speak of the"
1047,"late Prime Minister with the respect I bore him, and began to fall in"
1047,"with the popular caricature of him as an artful rabbit-witted person"
1047,"intent only on keeping his leadership, in spite of the vigorous attempts"
1047,"of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain to oust him therefrom. I ceased to qualify my"
1047,"statement that Protection would make food dearer for the agricultural"
1047,"labourer. I began to speak of Mr. Alfred Lyttelton as an influence at"
1047,"once insane and diabolical, as a man inspired by a passionate desire"
1047,"to substitute manacled but still criminal Chinese for honest British"
1047,"labourers throughout the world. And when it came to the mention of our"
1047,"own kindly leader, of Mr. John Burns or any one else of any prominence"
1047,"at all on our side I fell more and more into the intonation of one who"
1047,"mentions the high gods. And I had my reward in brighter meetings and"
1047,"readier and readier applause."
1047,""
1047,"One goes on from phase to phase in these things."
1047,""
1047,"""After all,"" I told myself, ""if one wants to get to Westminster one must"
1047,"follow the road that leads there,"" but I found the road nevertheless"
1047,"rather unexpectedly distasteful. ""When one gets there,"" I said, ""then it"
1047,"is one begins."""
1047,""
1047,"But I would lie awake at nights with that sore throat and headache and"
1047,"fatigue which come from speaking in ill-ventilated rooms, and wondering"
1047,"how far it was possible to educate a whole people to great political"
1047,"ideals. Why should political work always rot down to personalities and"
1047,"personal appeals in this way? Life is, I suppose, to begin with and"
1047,"end with a matter of personalities, from personalities all our broader"
1047,"interests arise and to personalities they return. All our social and"
1047,"political effort, all of it, is like trying to make a crowd of people"
1047,"fall into formation. The broader lines appear, but then come a rush"
1047,"and excitement and irrelevancy, and forthwith the incipient order has"
1047,"vanished and the marshals must begin the work over again!"
1047,""
1047,"My memory of all that time is essentially confusion. There was a"
1047,"frightful lot of tiresome locomotion in it; for the Kinghamstead"
1047,"Division is extensive, abounding in ill-graded and badly metalled"
1047,"cross-roads and vicious little hills, and singularly unpleasing to"
1047,"the eye in a muddy winter. It is sufficiently near to London to"
1047,"have undergone the same process of ill-regulated expansion that made"
1047,"Bromstead the place it is. Several of its overgrown villages have"
1047,"developed strings of factories and sidings along the railway lines, and"
1047,"there is an abundance of petty villas. There seemed to be no place"
1047,"at which one could take hold of more than this or that element of the"
1047,"population. Now we met in a meeting-house, now in a Masonic Hall or"
1047,"Drill Hall; I also did a certain amount of open-air speaking in the"
1047,"dinner hour outside gas-works and groups of factories. Some special sort"
1047,"of people was, as it were, secreted in response to each special appeal."
1047,"One said things carefully adjusted to the distinctive limitations of"
1047,"each gathering. Jokes of an incredible silliness and shallowness drifted"
1047,"about us. Our advisers made us declare that if we were elected we would"
1047,"live in the district, and one hasty agent had bills printed, ""If Mr."
1047,"Remington is elected he will live here."" The enemy obtained a number"
1047,"of these bills and stuck them on outhouses, pigstyes, dog-kennels; you"
1047,"cannot imagine how irksome the repetition of that jest became. The vast"
1047,"drifting indifference in between my meetings impressed me more and more."
1047,"I realised the vagueness of my own plans as I had never done before"
1047,"I brought them to the test of this experience. I was perplexed by the"
1047,"riddle of just how far I was, in any sense of the word, taking hold at"
1047,"all, how far I wasn't myself flowing into an accepted groove."
1047,""
1047,"Margaret was troubled by no such doubts. She was clear I had to go into"
1047,"Parliament on the side of Liberalism and the light, as against the late"
1047,"Government and darkness. Essential to the memory of my first contest, is"
1047,"the memory of her clear bright face, very resolute and grave, helping me"
1047,"consciously, steadfastly, with all her strength. Her quiet confidence,"
1047,"while I was so dissatisfied, worked curiously towards the alienation"
1047,"of my sympathies. I felt she had no business to be so sure of me. I had"
1047,"moments of vivid resentment at being thus marched towards Parliament."
1047,""
1047,"I seemed now always to be discovering alien forces of character in"
1047,"her. Her way of taking life diverged from me more and more. She sounded"
1047,"amazing, independent notes. She bought some particularly costly furs for"
1047,"the campaign that roused enthusiasm whenever she appeared. She also made"
1047,"me a birthday present in November of a heavily fur-trimmed coat and this"
1047,"she would make me remove as I went on to the platform, and hold over her"
1047,"arm until I was ready to resume it. It was fearfully heavy for her and"
1047,"she liked it to be heavy for her. That act of servitude was in essence"
1047,"a towering self-assertion. I would glance sideways while some chairman"
1047,"floundered through his introduction and see the clear blue eye with"
1047,"which she regarded the audience, which existed so far as she was"
1047,"concerned merely to return me to Parliament. It was a friendly eye,"
1047,"provided they were not silly or troublesome. But it kindled a little at"
1047,"the hint of a hostile question. After we had come so far and taken so"
1047,"much trouble!"
1047,""
1047,"She constituted herself the dragoman of our political travels. In hotels"
1047,"she was serenely resolute for the quietest and the best, she rejected"
1047,"all their proposals for meals and substituted a severely nourishing"
1047,"dietary of her own, and even in private houses she astonished me by her"
1047,"tranquil insistence upon special comforts and sustenance. I can see her"
1047,"face now as it would confront a hostess, a little intent, but sweetly"
1047,"resolute and assured."
1047,""
1047,"Since our marriage she had read a number of political memoirs, and she"
1047,"had been particularly impressed by the career of Mrs. Gladstone. I don't"
1047,"think it occurred to her to compare and contrast my quality with that"
1047,"of Mrs. Gladstone's husband. I suspect her of a deliberate intention"
1047,"of achieving parallel results by parallel methods. I was to be"
1047,"Gladstonised. Gladstone it appeared used to lubricate his speeches with"
1047,"a mixture--if my memory serves me right--of egg beaten up in sherry,"
1047,"and Margaret was very anxious I should take a leaf from that celebrated"
1047,"book. She wanted, I know, to hold the glass in her hand while I was"
1047,"speaking."
1047,""
1047,"But here I was firm. ""No,"" I said, very decisively, ""simply I won't"
1047,"stand that. It's a matter of conscience. I shouldn't feel--democratic."
1047,"I'll take my chance of the common water in the carafe on the chairman's"
1047,"table."""
1047,""
1047,"""I DO wish you wouldn't,"" she said, distressed."
1047,""
1047,"It was absurd to feel irritated; it was so admirable of her, a little"
1047,"childish, infinitely womanly and devoted and fine--and I see now how"
1047,"pathetic. But I could not afford to succumb to her. I wanted to follow"
1047,"my own leading, to see things clearly, and this reassuring pose of a"
1047,"high destiny, of an almost terribly efficient pursuit of a fixed end"
1047,"when as a matter of fact I had a very doubtful end and an aim as yet by"
1047,"no means fixed, was all too seductive for dalliance...."

1047,""
1047,"And into all these things with the manner of a trifling and casual"
1047,"incident comes the figure of Isabel Rivers. My first impressions of"
1047,"her were of a rather ugly and ungainly, extraordinarily interesting"
1047,"schoolgirl with a beautiful quick flush under her warm brown skin, who"
1047,"said and did amusing and surprising things. When first I saw her she"
1047,"was riding a very old bicycle downhill with her feet on the fork of the"
1047,"frame--it seemed to me to the public danger, but afterwards I came to"
1047,"understand the quality of her nerve better--and on the third occasion"
1047,"she was for her own private satisfaction climbing a tree. On the"
1047,"intervening occasion we had what seems now to have been a long sustained"
1047,"conversation about the political situation and the books and papers I"
1047,"had written."
1047,""
1047,"I wonder if it was."
1047,""
1047,"What a delightful mixture of child and grave woman she was at that time,"
1047,"and how little I reckoned on the part she would play in my life! And"
1047,"since she has played that part, how impossible it is to tell now of"
1047,"those early days! Since I wrote that opening paragraph to this section"
1047,"my idle pen has been, as it were, playing by itself and sketching faces"
1047,"on the blotting pad--one impish wizened visage is oddly like little"
1047,"Bailey--and I have been thinking cheek on fist amidst a limitless wealth"
1047,"of memories. She sits below me on the low wall under the olive trees"
1047,"with our little child in her arms. She is now the central fact in my"
1047,"life. It still seems a little incredible that that should be so. She has"
1047,"destroyed me as a politician, brought me to this belated rebeginning of"
1047,"life. When I sit down and try to make her a girl again, I feel like the"
1047,"Arabian fisherman who tried to put the genius back into the pot from"
1047,"which it had spread gigantic across the skies...."
1047,""
1047,"I have a very clear vision of her rush downhill past our"
1047,"labouring ascendant car--my colours fluttered from handle-bar and"
1047,"shoulder-knot--and her waving hand and the sharp note of her voice. She"
1047,"cried out something, I don't know what, some greeting."
1047,""
1047,"""What a pretty girl!"" said Margaret."
1047,""
1047,"Parvill, the cheap photographer, that industrious organiser for whom"
1047,"by way of repayment I got those magic letters, that knighthood of the"
1047,"underlings, ""J. P."" was in the car with us and explained her to us. ""One"
1047,"of the best workers you have,"" he said...."
1047,""
1047,"And then after a toilsome troubled morning we came, rather cross from"
1047,"the strain of sustained amiability, to Sir Graham Rivers' house. It"
1047,"seemed all softness and quiet--I recall dead white panelling and"
1047,"oval mirrors horizontally set and a marble fireplace between white"
1047,"marble-blind Homer and marble-blind Virgil, very grave and fine--and how"
1047,"Isabel came in to lunch in a shapeless thing like a blue smock that"
1047,"made her bright quick-changing face seem yellow under her cloud of black"
1047,"hair. Her step-sister was there, Miss Gamer, to whom the house was"
1047,"to descend, a well-dressed lady of thirty, amiably disavowing"
1047,"responsibility for Isabel in every phrase and gesture. And there was a"
1047,"very pleasant doctor, an Oxford man, who seemed on excellent terms with"
1047,"every one. It was manifest that he was in the habit of sparring with the"
1047,"girl, but on this occasion she wasn't sparring and refused to be teased"
1047,"into a display in spite of the taunts of either him or her father. She"
1047,"was, they discovered with rising eyebrows, shy. It seemed an opportunity"
1047,"too rare for them to miss. They proclaimed her enthusiasm for me in a"
1047,"way that brought a flush to her cheek and a look into her eye between"
1047,"appeal and defiance. They declared she had read my books, which I"
1047,"thought at the time was exaggeration, their dry political quality was so"
1047,"distinctly not what one was accustomed to regard as schoolgirl reading."
1047,"Miss Gamer protested to protect her, ""When once in a blue moon Isabel is"
1047,"well-behaved....!"""
1047,""
1047,"Except for these attacks I do not remember much of the conversation"
1047,"at table; it was, I know, discursive and concerned with the sort of"
1047,"topographical and social and electioneering fact natural to such a"
1047,"visit. Old Rivers struck me as a delightful person, modestly unconscious"
1047,"of his doubly-earned V. C. and the plucky defence of Kardin-Bergat that"
1047,"won his baronetcy. He was that excellent type, the soldier radical, and"
1047,"we began that day a friendship that was only ended by his death in the"
1047,"hunting-field three years later. He interested Margaret into a disregard"
1047,"of my plate and the fact that I had secured the illegal indulgence of"
1047,"Moselle. After lunch we went for coffee into another low room, this"
1047,"time brown panelled and looking through French windows on a red-walled"
1047,"garden, graceful even in its winter desolation. And there the"
1047,"conversation suddenly picked up and became good. It had fallen to a"
1047,"pause, and the doctor, with an air of definitely throwing off a mask"
1047,"and wrecking an established tranquillity, remarked: ""Very probably you"
1047,"Liberals will come in, though I'm not sure you'll come in so mightily as"
1047,"you think, but what you do when you do come in passes my comprehension."""
1047,""
1047,"""There's good work sometimes,"" said Sir Graham, ""in undoing."""
1047,""
1047,"""You can't govern a great empire by amending and repealing the Acts of"
1047,"your predecessors,"" said the doctor."
1047,""
1047,"There came that kind of pause that happens when a subject is broached"
1047,"too big and difficult for the gathering. Margaret's blue eyes regarded"
1047,"the speaker with quiet disapproval for a moment, and then came to me in"
1047,"the not too confident hope that I would snub him out of existence with"
1047,"some prompt rhetorical stroke. A voice spoke out of the big armchair."
1047,""
1047,"""We'll do things,"" said Isabel."
1047,""
1047,"The doctor's eye lit with the joy of the fisherman who strikes his fish"
1047,"at last. ""What will you do?"" he asked her."
1047,""
1047,"""Every one knows we're a mixed lot,"" said Isabel."
1047,""
1047,"""Poor old chaps like me!"" interjected the general."
1047,""
1047,"""But that's not a programme,"" said the doctor."
1047,""
1047,"""But Mr. Remington has published a programme,"" said Isabel."
1047,""
1047,"The doctor cocked half an eye at me."
1047,""
1047,"""In some review,"" the girl went on. ""After all, we're not going to"
1047,"elect the whole Liberal party in the Kinghamstead Division. I'm a"
1047,"Remington-ite!"""
1047,""
1047,"""But the programme,"" said the doctor, ""the programme--"""

1047,""
1047,"""THIS muddle,"" protested the doctor with an appeal of the eye to the"
1047,"beautiful long room and the ordered garden outside the bright clean"
1047,"windows."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, THAT muddle, if you like! There's a slum within a mile of us"

1047,"""Oh!"" said Isabel. ""At times one has to be--Napoleonic. They want to"
1047,"libel me, Mr. Remington. A political worker can't always be in time for"
1047,"meals, can she? At times one has to make--splendid cuts."""
1047,""
1047,"Miss Gamer said something indistinctly."
1047,""
1047,"""Order, education, discipline,"" said Sir Graham. ""Excellent things!"
1047,"But I've a sort of memory--in my young days--we talked about something"
1047,"called liberty."""
1047,""
1047,"""Liberty under the law,"" I said, with an unexpected approving murmur"
1047,"from Margaret, and took up the defence. ""The old Liberal definition of"
1047,"liberty was a trifle uncritical. Privilege and legal restrictions are"
1047,"not the only enemies of liberty. An uneducated, underbred, and underfed"
1047,"propertyless man is a man who has lost the possibility of liberty."
1047,"There's no liberty worth a rap for him. A man who is swimming hopelessly"
1047,"for life wants nothing but the liberty to get out of the water; he'll"
1047,"give every other liberty for it--until he gets out."""
1047,""
1047,"Sir Graham took me up and we fell into a discussion of the"
1047,"changing qualities of Liberalism. It was a good give-and-take talk,"
1047,"extraordinarily refreshing after the nonsense and crowding secondary"
1047,"issues of the electioneering outside. We all contributed more or less"
1047,"except Miss Gamer; Margaret followed with knitted brows and occasional"
1047,"interjections. ""People won't SEE that,"" for example, and ""It all seems"
1047,"so plain to me."" The doctor showed himself clever but unsubstantial and"
1047,"inconsistent. Isabel sat back with her black mop of hair buried deep in"
1047,"the chair looking quickly from face to face. Her colour came and went"
1047,"with her vivid intellectual excitement; occasionally she would dart"
1047,"a word, usually a very apt word, like a lizard's tongue into the"
1047,"discussion. I remember chiefly that a chance illustration betrayed that"
1047,"she had read Bishop Burnet...."
1047,""
1047,"After that it was not surprising that Isabel should ask for a lift in"
1047,"our car as far as the Lurky Committee Room, and that she should offer"
1047,"me quite sound advice EN ROUTE upon the intellectual temperament of the"
1047,"Lurky gasworkers."
1047,""
1047,"On the third occasion that I saw Isabel she was, as I have said,"
1047,"climbing a tree--and a very creditable tree--for her own private"
1047,"satisfaction. It was a lapse from the high seriousness of politics, and"
1047,"I perceived she felt that I might regard it as such and attach too much"
1047,"importance to it. I had some difficulty in reassuring her. And it's odd"
1047,"to note now--it has never occurred to me before--that from that day to"
1047,"this I do not think I have ever reminded Isabel of that encounter."
1047,""
1047,"And after that memory she seems to be flickering about always in the"
1047,"election, an inextinguishable flame; now she flew by on her bicycle,"
1047,"now she dashed into committee rooms, now she appeared on doorsteps in"
1047,"animated conversation with dubious voters; I took every chance I could"
1047,"to talk to her--I had never met anything like her before in the world,"
1047,"and she interested me immensely--and before the polling day she and I"
1047,"had become, in the frankest simplicity, fast friends...."
1047,""
1047,"That, I think, sets out very fairly the facts of our early relationship."
1047,"But it is hard to get it true, either in form or texture, because of"
1047,"the bright, translucent, coloured, and refracting memories that come"
1047,"between. One forgets not only the tint and quality of thoughts and"
1047,"impressions through that intervening haze, one forgets them altogether."
1047,"I don't remember now that I ever thought in those days of passionate"
1047,"love or the possibility of such love between us. I may have done so"
1047,"again and again. But I doubt it very strongly. I don't think I ever"
1047,"thought of such aspects. I had no more sense of any danger between us,"
1047,"seeing the years and things that separated us, than I could have had if"
1047,"she had been an intelligent bright-eyed bird. Isabel came into my"
1047,"life as a new sort of thing; she didn't join on at all to my previous"
1047,"experiences of womanhood. They were not, as I have laboured to explain,"
1047,"either very wide or very penetrating experiences, on the whole,"
1047,"""strangled dinginess"" expresses them, but I do not believe they were"
1047,"narrower or shallower than those of many other men of my class. I"
1047,"thought of women as pretty things and beautiful things, pretty rather"
1047,"than beautiful, attractive and at times disconcertingly attractive,"
1047,"often bright and witty, but, because of the vast reservations that hid"
1047,"them from me, wanting, subtly and inevitably wanting, in understanding."
1047,"My idealisation of Margaret had evaporated insensibly after our"
1047,"marriage. The shrine I had made for her in my private thoughts stood"
1047,"at last undisguisedly empty. But Isabel did not for a moment admit of"
1047,"either idealisation or interested contempt. She opened a new sphere"
1047,"of womanhood to me. With her steady amber-brown eyes, her unaffected"
1047,"interest in impersonal things, her upstanding waistless blue body, her"
1047,"energy, decision and courage, she seemed rather some new and infinitely"
1047,"finer form of boyhood than a feminine creature, as I had come to measure"
1047,"femininity. She was my perfect friend. Could I have foreseen, had my"
1047,"world been more wisely planned, to this day we might have been such"
1047,"friends."
1047,""
1047,"She seemed at that time unconscious of sex, though she has told me since"
1047,"how full she was of protesting curiosities and restrained emotions. She"
1047,"spoke, as indeed she has always spoken, simply, clearly, and vividly;"
1047,"schoolgirl slang mingled with words that marked ample voracious reading,"
1047,"and she moved quickly with the free directness of some graceful young"
1047,"animal. She took many of the easy freedoms a man or a sister might have"
1047,"done with me. She would touch my arm, lay a hand on my shoulder as I"
1047,"sat, adjust the lapel of a breast-pocket as she talked to me. She says"
1047,"now she loved me always from the beginning. I doubt if there was a"
1047,"suspicion of that in her mind those days. I used to find her regarding"
1047,"me with the clearest, steadiest gaze in the world, exactly like the gaze"
1047,"of some nice healthy innocent animal in a forest, interested, inquiring,"
1047,"speculative, but singularly untroubled...."

1047,"Polling day came after a last hoarse and dingy crescendo. The excitement"
1047,"was not of the sort that makes one forget one is tired out. The waiting"
1047,"for the end of the count has left a long blank mark on my memory, and"
1047,"then everyone was shaking my hand and repeating: ""Nine hundred and"
1047,"seventy-six."""
1047,""
1047,"My success had been a foregone conclusion since the afternoon, but"
1047,"we all behaved as though we had not been anticipating this result for"
1047,"hours, as though any other figures but nine hundred and seventy-six"
1047,"would have meant something entirely different. ""Nine hundred and"
1047,"seventy-six!"" said Margaret. ""They didn't expect three hundred."""

1047,"""Nine hundred and seventy-six,"" said a little short man with a paper."
1047,"""It means a big turnover. Two dozen short of a thousand, you know."""

1047,"Isabel, flushed but not out of breath, Heaven knows where she had sprung"

1047,"she said. ""It's been no end of a lark."""
1047,""
1047,"""And now,"" said I, ""I must go and be constructive."""
1047,""
1047,"""Now you must go and be constructive,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"""You've got to live here,"" she added."
1047,""

1047,"""I shall read all your speeches."""

1047,"She hesitated."
1047,""
1047,"""I wish I was you,"" she said, and said it as though it was not exactly"
1047,"the thing she was meaning to say."
1047,""
1047,"""They want you to speak,"" said Margaret, with something unsaid in her"
1047,"face."
1047,""
1047,"""You must come out with me,"" I answered, putting my arm through hers,"
1047,"and felt someone urging me to the French windows that gave on the"
1047,"balcony."

1047,"""If you think--"" she said, yielding gladly"
1047,""
1047,"""Oh, RATHER!"" said I."

1047,"The Mayor of Kinghamstead, a managing little man with no great belief in"
1047,"my oratorical powers, was sticking his face up to mine."

1047,"""It's all over,"" he said, ""and you've won. Say all the nice things you"

1047,""
1047,"I turned and handed Margaret out through the window and stood looking"
1047,"over the Market-place, which was more than half filled with swaying"
1047,"people. The crowd set up a roar of approval at the sight of us, tempered"
1047,"by a little booing. Down in one corner of the square a fight was going"
1047,"on for a flag, a fight that even the prospect of a speech could not"
1047,"instantly check. ""Speech!"" cried voices, ""Speech!"" and then a brief"
1047,"""boo-oo-oo"" that was drowned in a cascade of shouts and cheers. The"
1047,"conflict round the flag culminated in the smashing of a pane of glass in"
1047,"the chemist's window and instantly sank to peace."
1047,""
1047,"""Gentlemen voters of the Kinghamstead Division,"" I began."
1047,""
1047,"""Votes for Women!"" yelled a voice, amidst laughter--the first time I"
1047,"remember hearing that memorable war-cry."
1047,""
1047,"""Three cheers for Mrs. Remington!"""
1047,""
1047,"""Mrs. Remington asks me to thank you,"" I said, amidst further uproar and"

1047,""
1047,"Then silence came with a startling swiftness."
1047,""
1047,"Isabel was still in my mind, I suppose. ""I shall go to Westminster,"" I"
1047,"began. I sought for some compelling phrase and could not find one."
1047,"""To do my share,"" I went on, ""in building up a great and splendid"

1047,"""This election,"" I said, ""has been the end and the beginning of much."
1047,"New ideas are abroad--"""

1047,"""Chinese labour,"" yelled a voice, and across the square swept a wildfire"
1047,"of booting and bawling."
1047,""
1047,"It is one of the few occasions when I quite lost my hold on a speech. I"
1047,"glanced sideways and saw the Mayor of Kinghamstead speaking behind his"
1047,"hand to Parvill. By a happy chance Parvill caught my eye."
1047,""
1047,"""What do they want?"" I asked."

1047,"hastily into a more popular strain with a gross eulogy of my opponent's"
1047,"good taste."

1047,"""Chinese labour!"" cried the voice again."
1047,""
1047,"""You've given that notice to quit,"" I answered."

1047,"The Market-place roared delight, but whether that delight expressed"
1047,"hostility to Chinamen or hostility to their practical enslavement no"
1047,"student of the General Election of 1906 has ever been able to determine."
1047,"Certainly one of the most effective posters on our side displayed a"
1047,"hideous yellow face, just that and nothing more. There was not even a"

1047,"Kinghamstead was one of the earliest constituencies fought, and we came"
1047,"back--it must have been Saturday--triumphant but very tired, to our"
1047,"house in Radnor Square. In the train we read the first intimations that"
1047,"the victory of our party was likely to be a sweeping one."
1047,""
1047,"Then came a period when one was going about receiving and giving"
1047,"congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy who"
1047,"has returned to school with the first batch after the holidays. The"
1047,"London world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded the"
1047,"nurseries. All the children of one's friends had got big maps of England"
1047,"cut up into squares to represent constituencies and were busy sticking"
1047,"gummed blue labels over the conquered red of Unionism that had hitherto"
1047,"submerged the country. And there were also orange labels, if I remember"
1047,"rightly, to represent the new Labour party, and green for the Irish. I"
1047,"engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched"
1047,"at the Reform, which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two"
1047,"tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active"
1047,"eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards"
1047,"midnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big"
1047,"green-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large"
1047,"smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that"
1047,"day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers"
1047,"that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there"
1047,"was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there"
1047,"was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was"
1047,"there."
1047,""
1047,"How packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and"
1047,"whisky fumes we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of"
1047,"harsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then"
1047,"hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much"
1047,"in evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave"
1047,"brief addresses attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst"
1047,"much enthusiasm."
1047,""
1047,"""Now we can DO things!"" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I did"
1047,"not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled"
1047,"approval as I came down past them into the crowd again."

1047,"Men were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two"
1047,"hundred seats."

1047,"""I wonder just what we shall do with it all,"" I heard one sceptic"
1047,"speculating...."

1047,"After these orgies I would get home very tired and excited, and find it"
1047,"difficult to get to sleep. I would lie and speculate about what it was"
1047,"we WERE going to do. One hadn't anticipated quite such a tremendous"
1047,"accession to power for one's party. Liberalism was swirling in like a"
1047,"flood...."
1047,""
1047,"I found the next few weeks very unsatisfactory and distressing. I don't"
1047,"clearly remember what it was I had expected; I suppose the fuss and"
1047,"strain of the General Election had built up a feeling that my return"
1047,"would in some way put power into my hands, and instead I found myself"
1047,"a mere undistinguished unit in a vast but rather vague majority. There"
1047,"were moments when I felt very distinctly that a majority could be"
1047,"too big a crowd altogether. I had all my work still before me, I had"
1047,"achieved nothing as yet but opportunity, and a very crowded opportunity"
1047,"it was at that. Everyone about me was chatting Parliament and"
1047,"appointments; one breathed distracting and irritating speculations as"
1047,"to what would be done and who would be asked to do it. I was chiefly"
1047,"impressed by what was unlikely to be done and by the absence of any"
1047,"general plan of legislation to hold us all together. I found the talk"
1047,"about Parliamentary procedure and etiquette particularly trying. We"
1047,"dined with the elder Cramptons one evening, and old Sir Edward was"
1047,"lengthily sage about what the House liked, what it didn't like, what"
1047,"made a good impression and what a bad one. ""A man shouldn't speak more"
1047,"than twice in his first session, and not at first on too contentious a"
1047,"topic,"" said Sir Edward. ""No."""

1047,"He waved his cigar to eke out his words."
1047,""
1047,"""Little peculiarities of costume count for a great deal. I could name"
1047,"one man who spent three years living down a pair of spatterdashers. On"

1047,"man, for example, may be your making."""
1047,""
1047,"He went off into a lengthy speculation of why the House had come to like"
1047,"an originally unpopular Irishman named Biggar...."
1047,""
1047,"The opening of Parliament gave me some peculiar moods. I began to feel"
1047,"more and more like a branded sheep. We were sworn in in batches,"
1047,"dozens and scores of fresh men, trying not to look too fresh under the"
1047,"inspection of policemen and messengers, all of us carrying new silk hats"
1047,"and wearing magisterial coats. It is one of my vivid memories from this"
1047,"period, the sudden outbreak of silk hats in the smoking-room of the"
1047,"National Liberal Club. At first I thought there must have been a"
1047,"funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under soft felt hats,"
1047,"under bowlers, under liberal-minded wide brims, and above artistic ties"
1047,"and tweed jackets, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of"
1047,"self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There"
1047,"was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a"
1047,"good Parliamentary style."
1047,""
1047,"There was much play with the hats all through; a tremendous competition"
1047,"to get in first and put hats on coveted seats. A memory hangs about me"
1047,"of the House in the early afternoon, an inhumane desolation inhabited"
1047,"almost entirely by silk hats. The current use of cards to secure seats"
1047,"came later. There were yards and yards of empty green benches with hats"
1047,"and hats and hats distributed along them, resolute-looking top hats, lax"
1047,"top hats with a kind of shadowy grin under them, sensible top bats brim"
1047,"upward, and one scandalous incontinent that had rolled from the front"
1047,"Opposition bench right to the middle of the floor. A headless hat is"
1047,"surely the most soulless thing in the world, far worse even than a"
1047,"skull...."
1047,""
1047,"At last, in a leisurely muddled manner we got to the Address; and"
1047,"I found myself packed in a dense elbowing crowd to the right of the"
1047,"Speaker's chair; while the attenuated Opposition, nearly leaderless"
1047,"after the massacre, tilted its brim to its nose and sprawled at its ease"
1047,"amidst its empty benches."
1047,""
1047,"There was a tremendous hullaboo about something, and I craned to see"
1047,"over the shoulder of the man in front. ""Order, order, order!"""
1047,""
1047,"""What's it about?"" I asked."
1047,""
1047,"The man in front of me was clearly no better informed, and then I"
1047,"gathered from a slightly contemptuous Scotchman beside me that it was"
1047,"Chris Robinson had walked between the honourable member in possession"
1047,"of the house and the Speaker. I caught a glimpse of him blushingly"
1047,"whispering about his misadventure to a colleague. He was just that"
1047,"same little figure I had once assisted to entertain at Cambridge, but"
1047,"grey-haired now, and still it seemed with the same knitted muffler"
1047,"he had discarded for a reckless half-hour while he talked to us in"

1047,"It dawned upon me that I wasn't particularly wanted in the House, and"
1047,"that I should get all I needed of the opening speeches next day from the"
1047,"TIMES."

1047,"I made my way out and was presently walking rather aimlessly through the"
1047,"outer lobby."

1047,"I caught myself regarding the shadow that spread itself out before me,"
1047,"multiplied itself in blue tints of various intensity, shuffled itself"
1047,"like a pack of cards under the many lights, the square shoulders, the"
1047,"silk hat, already worn with a parliamentary tilt backward; I found I was"
1047,"surveying this statesmanlike outline with a weak approval. ""A MEMBER!"""
1047,"I felt the little cluster of people that were scattered about the lobby"
1047,"must be saying."
1047,""
1047,"""Good God!"" I said in hot reaction, ""what am I doing here?"""
1047,""
1047,"It was one of those moments infinitely trivial in themselves, that yet"
1047,"are cardinal in a man's life. It came to me with extreme vividness that"
1047,"it wasn't so much that I had got hold of something as that something"
1047,"had got hold of me. I distinctly recall the rebound of my mind. Whatever"
1047,"happened in this Parliament, I at least would attempt something. ""By"
1047,"God!"" I said, ""I won't be overwhelmed. I am here to do something, and do"
1047,"something I will!"""
1047,""
1047,"But I felt that for the moment I could not remain in the House."

1047,"I went out by myself with my thoughts into the night. It was a chilling"
1047,"night, and rare spots of rain were falling. I glanced over my shoulder"
1047,"at the lit windows of the Lords. I walked, I remember, westward, and"
1047,"presently came to the Grosvenar Embankment and followed it, watching the"
1047,"glittering black rush of the river and the dark, dimly lit barges round"
1047,"which the water swirled. Across the river was the hunched sky-line of"
1047,"Doulton's potteries, and a kiln flared redly. Dimly luminous trams were"
1047,"gliding amidst a dotted line of lamps, and two little trains crawled"
1047,"into Waterloo station. Mysterious black figures came by me and were"
1047,"suddenly changed to the commonplace at the touch of the nearer lamps. It"
1047,"was a big confused world, I felt, for a man to lay his hands upon."
1047,""
1047,"I remember I crossed Vauxhall Bridge and stood for a time watching the"
1047,"huge black shapes in the darkness under the gas-works. A shoal of coal"
1047,"barges lay indistinctly on the darkly shining mud and water below, and"
1047,"a colossal crane was perpetually hauling up coal into mysterious"
1047,"blacknesses above, and dropping the empty clutch back to the barges."
1047,"Just one or two minute black featureless figures of men toiled amidst"
1047,"these monster shapes. They did not seem to be controlling them but only"
1047,"moving about among them. These gas-works have a big chimney that belches"
1047,"a lurid flame into the night, a livid shivering bluish flame, shot with"
1047,"strange crimson streaks...."
1047,""
1047,"On the other side of Lambeth Bridge broad stairs go down to the lapping"
1047,"water of the river; the lower steps are luminous under the lamps and"
1047,"one treads unwarned into thick soft Thames mud. They seem to be purely"
1047,"architectural steps, they lead nowhere, they have an air of absolute"

1047,"Those shapes and large inhuman places--for all of mankind that one"
1047,"sees at night about Lambeth is minute and pitiful beside the industrial"
1047,"monsters that snort and toil there--mix up inextricably with my memories"
1047,"of my first days as a legislator. Black figures drift by me, heavy vans"
1047,"clatter, a newspaper rough tears by on a motor bicycle, and presently,"
1047,"on the Albert Embankment, every seat has its one or two outcasts huddled"
1047,"together and slumbering."

1047,"I remember the swirl of the tide upon the water, and how a string of"
1047,"barges presently came swinging and bumping round as high-water turned"
1047,"to ebb. That sudden change of position and my brief perplexity at it,"
1047,"sticks like a paper pin through the substance of my thoughts. It was"
1047,"then I was moved to prayer. I prayed that night that life might not"
1047,"be in vain, that in particular I might not live in vain. I prayed for"
1047,"strength and faith, that the monstrous blundering forces in life might"
1047,"not overwhelm me, might not beat me back to futility and a meaningless"
1047,"acquiescence in existent things. I knew myself for the weakling I was,"
1047,"I knew that nevertheless it was set for me to make such order as I could"
1047,"out of these disorders, and my task cowed me, gave me at the thought of"
1047,"it a sense of yielding feebleness."
1047,""
1047,"""Break me, O God,"" I prayed at last, ""disgrace me, torment me, destroy"
1047,"me as you will, but save me from self-complacency and little interests"
1047,"and little successes and the life that passes like the shadow of a"
1047,"dream."""

1047,""
1047,"I have been planning and replanning, writing and rewriting, this next"
1047,"portion of my book for many days. I perceive I must leave it raw edged"
1047,"and ill joined. I have learnt something of the impossibility of History."
1047,"For all I have had to tell is the story of one man's convictions and"
1047,"aims and how they reacted upon his life; and I find it too subtle and"
1047,"involved and intricate for the doing. I find it taxes all my powers to"
1047,"convey even the main forms and forces in that development. It is like"
1047,"looking through moving media of changing hue and variable refraction"
1047,"at something vitally unstable. Broad theories and generalisations are"
1047,"mingled with personal influences, with prevalent prejudices; and"
1047,"not only coloured but altered by phases of hopefulness and moods of"
1047,"depression. The web is made up of the most diverse elements, beyond"
1047,"treatment multitudinous.... For a week or so I desisted altogether,"
1047,"and walked over the mountains and returned to sit through the warm soft"
1047,"mornings among the shaded rocks above this little perched-up house of"
1047,"ours, discussing my difficulties with Isabel and I think on the whole"
1047,"complicating them further in the effort to simplify them to manageable"
1047,"and stateable elements."
1047,""
1047,"Let me, nevertheless, attempt a rough preliminary analysis of this"
1047,"confused process. A main strand is quite easily traceable. This main"
1047,"strand is the story of my obvious life, my life as it must have looked"
1047,"to most of my acquaintances. It presents you with a young couple,"
1047,"bright, hopeful, and energetic, starting out under Altiora's auspices to"
1047,"make a career. You figure us well dressed and active, running about in"
1047,"motor-cars, visiting in great people's houses, dining amidst brilliant"
1047,"companies, going to the theatre, meeting in the lobby. Margaret wore"
1047,"hundreds of beautiful dresses. We must have had an air of succeeding"
1047,"meritoriously during that time."
1047,""
1047,"We did very continually and faithfully serve our joint career. I thought"
1047,"about it a great deal, and did and refrained from doing ten thousand"
1047,"things for the sake of it. I kept up a solicitude for it, as it were by"
1047,"inertia, long after things had happened and changes occurred in me"
1047,"that rendered its completion impossible. Under certain very artless"
1047,"pretences, we wanted steadfastly to make a handsome position in the"
1047,"world, achieve respect, SUCCEED. Enormous unseen changes had been in"
1047,"progress for years in my mind and the realities of my life, before"
1047,"our general circle could have had any inkling of their existence, or"
1047,"suspected the appearances of our life. Then suddenly our proceedings"
1047,"began to be deflected, our outward unanimity visibly strained and marred"
1047,"by the insurgence of these so long-hidden developments."
1047,""
1047,"That career had its own hidden side, of course; but when I write"
1047,"of these unseen factors I do not mean that but something altogether"
1047,"broader. I do not mean the everyday pettinesses which gave the cynical"
1047,"observer scope and told of a narrower, baser aspect of the fair but"
1047,"limited ambitions of my ostensible self. This ""sub-careerist"" element"
1047,"noted little things that affected the career, made me suspicious of the"
1047,"rivalry of so-and-so, propitiatory to so-and-so, whom, as a matter of"
1047,"fact, I didn't respect or feel in the least sympathetic towards; guarded"
1047,"with that man, who for all his charm and interest wasn't helpful, and"
1047,"a little touchy at the appearance of neglect from that. No, I mean"
1047,"something greater and not something smaller when I write of a hidden"
1047,"life."
1047,""
1047,"In the ostensible self who glowed under the approbation of Altiora"
1047,"Bailey, and was envied and discussed, praised and depreciated, in the"
1047,"House and in smoking-room gossip, you really have as much of a man as"
1047,"usually figures in a novel or an obituary notice. But I am tremendously"
1047,"impressed now in the retrospect by the realisation of how little that"
1047,"frontage represented me, and just how little such frontages do represent"
1047,"the complexities of the intelligent contemporary. Behind it, yet"
1047,"struggling to disorganise and alter it, altogether, was a far more"
1047,"essential reality, a self less personal, less individualised, and"
1047,"broader in its references. Its aims were never simply to get on; it"
1047,"had an altogether different system of demands and satisfactions. It"
1047,"was critical, curious, more than a little unfeeling--and relentlessly"
1047,"illuminating."
1047,""
1047,"It is just the existence and development of this more generalised"
1047,"self-behind-the-frontage that is making modern life so much more subtle"
1047,"and intricate to render, and so much more hopeful in its relations"
1047,"to the perplexities of the universe. I see this mental and spiritual"
1047,"hinterland vary enormously in the people about me, from a type which"
1047,"seems to keep, as people say, all its goods in the window, to others"
1047,"who, like myself, come to regard the ostensible existence more and more"
1047,"as a mere experimental feeder and agent for that greater personality"
1047,"behind. And this back-self has its history of phases, its crises and"
1047,"happy accidents and irrevocable conclusions, more or less distinct from"
1047,"the adventures and achievements of the ostensible self. It meets persons"
1047,"and phrases, it assimilates the spirit of a book, it is startled into"
1047,"new realisations by some accident that seems altogether irrelevant to"
1047,"the general tenor of one's life. Its increasing independence of the"
1047,"ostensible career makes it the organ of corrective criticism; it"
1047,"accumulates disturbing energy. Then it breaks our overt promises and"
1047,"repudiates our pledges, coming down at last like an overbearing mentor"
1047,"upon the small engagements of the pupil."
1047,""
1047,"In the life of the individual it takes the role that the growth of"
1047,"philosophy, science, and creative literature may play in the development"
1047,"of mankind."

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"It is curious to recall how Britten helped shatter that obvious,"
1047,"lucidly explicable presentation of myself upon which I had embarked"
1047,"with Margaret. He returned to revive a memory of adolescent dreams and a"
1047,"habit of adolescent frankness; he reached through my shallow frontage"
1047,"as no one else seemed capable of doing, and dragged that back-self into"
1047,"relation with it."
1047,""
1047,"I remember very distinctly a dinner and a subsequent walk with him"
1047,"which presents itself now as altogether typical of the quality of his"
1047,"influence."
1047,""
1047,"I had come upon him one day while lunching with Somers and Sutton at"
1047,"the Playwrights' Club, and had asked him to dinner on the spur of the"
1047,"moment. He was oddly the same curly-headed, red-faced ventriloquist, and"
1047,"oddly different, rather seedy as well as untidy, and at first a little"
1047,"inclined to make comparisons with my sleek successfulness. But that"
1047,"disposition presently evaporated, and his talk was good and fresh and"
1047,"provocative. And something that had long been straining at its checks in"
1047,"my mind flapped over, and he and I found ourselves of one accord."
1047,""
1047,"Altiora wasn't at this dinner. When she came matters were apt to become"
1047,"confusedly strenuous. There was always a slight and ineffectual struggle"
1047,"at the end on the part of Margaret to anticipate Altiora's overpowering"
1047,"tendency to a rally and the establishment of some entirely unjustifiable"
1047,"conclusion by a COUP-DE-MAIN. When, however, Altiora was absent, the"
1047,"quieter influence of the Cramptons prevailed; temperance and information"
1047,"for its own sake prevailed excessively over dinner and the play of"
1047,"thought.... Good Lord! what bores the Cramptons were! I wonder I"
1047,"endured them as I did. They had all of them the trick of lying in wait"
1047,"conversationally; they had no sense of the self-exposures, the gallant"
1047,"experiments in statement that are necessary for good conversation. They"
1047,"would watch one talking with an expression exactly like peeping through"
1047,"bushes. Then they would, as it were, dash out, dissent succinctly,"
1047,"contradict some secondary fact, and back to cover. They gave one"
1047,"twilight nerves. Their wives were easier but still difficult at a"
1047,"stretch; they talked a good deal about children and servants, but with"
1047,"an air caught from Altiora of making observations upon sociological"
1047,"types. Lewis gossiped about the House in an entirely finite manner. He"
1047,"never raised a discussion; nobody ever raised a discussion. He would ask"
1047,"what we thought of Evesham's question that afternoon, and Edward would"
1047,"say it was good, and Mrs. Willie, who had been behind the grille, would"
1047,"think it was very good, and then Willie, parting the branches, would say"
1047,"rather conclusively that he didn't think it was very much good, and I"
1047,"would deny hearing the question in order to evade a profitless statement"
1047,"of views in that vacuum, and then we would cast about in our minds for"
1047,"some other topic of equal interest...."
1047,""
1047,"On this occasion Altiora was absent, and to qualify our Young Liberal"
1047,"bleakness we had Mrs. Millingham, with her white hair and her fresh mind"
1047,"and complexion, and Esmeer. Willie Crampton was with us, but not his"
1047,"wife, who was having her third baby on principle; his brother Edward was"
1047,"present, and the Lewises, and of course the Bunting Harblows. There was"
1047,"also some other lady. I remember her as pale blue, but for the life of"
1047,"me I cannot remember her name."
1047,""
1047,"Quite early there was a little breeze between Edward Crampton and"
1047,"Esmeer, who had ventured an opinion about the partition of Poland."
1047,"Edward was at work then upon the seventh volume of his monumental Life"
1047,"of Kosciusko, and a little impatient with views perhaps not altogether"
1047,"false but betraying a lamentable ignorance of accessible literature. At"
1047,"any rate, his correction of Esmeer was magisterial. After that there was"
1047,"a distinct and not altogether delightful pause, and then some one, it"
1047,"may have been the pale-blue lady, asked Mrs. Lewis whether her aunt Lady"
1047,"Carmixter had returned from her rest-and-sun-cure in Italy. That led to"
1047,"a rather anxiously sustained talk about regimen, and Willie told us how"
1047,"he had profited by the no-breakfast system. It had increased his power"
1047,"of work enormously. He could get through ten hours a day now without"
1047,"inconvenience."
1047,""
1047,"""What do you do?"" said Esmeer abruptly."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh! no end of work. There's all the estate and looking after things."""
1047,""
1047,"""But publicly?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I asked three questions yesterday. And for one of them I had to consult"
1047,"nine books!"""
1047,""
1047,"We were drifting, I could see, towards Doctor Haig's system of dietary,"
1047,"and whether the exclusion or inclusion of fish and chicken were most"
1047,"conducive to high efficiency, when Britten, who had refused lemonade"
1047,"and claret and demanded Burgundy, broke out, and was discovered to be"
1047,"demanding in his throat just what we Young Liberals thought we were up"
1047,"to?"
1047,""
1047,"""I want,"" said Britten, repeating his challenge a little louder, ""to"
1047,"hear just exactly what you think you are doing in Parliament?"""
1047,""
1047,"Lewis laughed nervously, and thought we were ""Seeking the Good of the"
1047,"Community."""
1047,""
1047,"""HOW?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Beneficient Legislation,"" said Lewis."
1047,""
1047,"""Beneficient in what direction?"" insisted Britten. ""I want to know where"
1047,"you think you are going."""
1047,""
1047,"""Amelioration of Social Conditions,"" said Lewis."
1047,""
1047,"""That's only a phrase!"""
1047,""
1047,"""You wouldn't have me sketch bills at dinner?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I'd like you to indicate directions,"" said Britten, and waited."
1047,""
1047,"""Upward and On,"" said Lewis with conscious neatness, and turned to ask"
1047,"Mrs. Bunting Harblow about her little boy's French."
1047,""
1047,"For a time talk frothed over Britten's head, but the natural mischief"
1047,"in Mrs. Millingham had been stirred, and she was presently echoing his"
1047,"demand in lisping, quasi-confidential undertones. ""What ARE we Liberals"
1047,"doing?"" Then Esmeer fell in with the revolutionaries."
1047,""
1047,"To begin with, I was a little shocked by this clamour for"
1047,"fundamentals--and a little disconcerted. I had the experience that I"
1047,"suppose comes to every one at times of discovering oneself together with"
1047,"two different sets of people with whom one has maintained two different"
1047,"sets of attitudes. It had always been, I perceived, an instinctive"
1047,"suppression in our circle that we shouldn't be more than vague about our"
1047,"political ideals. It had almost become part of my morality to respect"
1047,"this convention. It was understood we were all working hard, and keeping"
1047,"ourselves fit, tremendously fit, under Altiora's inspiration, Pro Bono"
1047,"Publico. Bunting Harblow had his under-secretaryship, and Lewis was on"
1047,"the verge of the Cabinet, and these things we considered to be in the"
1047,"nature of confirmations.... It added to the discomfort of the situation"
1047,"that these plunging enquiries were being made in the presence of our"
1047,"wives."
1047,""
1047,"The rebel section of our party forced the talk."
1047,""
1047,"Edward Crampton was presently declaring--I forget in what relation: ""The"
1047,"country is with us."""
1047,""
1047,"My long-controlled hatred of the Cramptons' stereotyped phrases about"
1047,"the Country and the House got the better of me. I showed my cloven hoof"
1047,"to my friends for the first time."
1047,""
1047,"""We don't respect the Country as we used to do,"" I said. ""We haven't"
1047,"the same belief we used to have in the will of the people. It's no"
1047,"good, Crampton, trying to keep that up. We Liberals know as a matter of"
1047,"fact--nowadays every one knows--that the monster that brought us into"
1047,"power has, among other deficiencies, no head. We've got to give it"
1047,"one--if possible with brains and a will. That lies in the future. For"
1047,"the present if the country is with us, it means merely that we happen to"
1047,"have hold of its tether."""
1047,""
1047,"Lewis was shocked. A ""mandate"" from the Country was sacred to his system"
1047,"of pretences."
1047,""
1047,"Britten wasn't subdued by his first rebuff; presently he was at"
1047,"us again. There were several attempts to check his outbreak of"
1047,"interrogation; I remember the Cramptons asked questions about the"
1047,"welfare of various cousins of Lewis who were unknown to the rest of us,"
1047,"and Margaret tried to engage Britten in a sympathetic discussion of the"
1047,"Arts and Crafts exhibition. But Britten and Esmeer were persistent, Mrs."
1047,"Millingham was mischievous, and in the end our rising hopes of Young"
1047,"Liberalism took to their thickets for good, while we talked all over"
1047,"them of the prevalent vacuity of political intentions. Margaret was"
1047,"perplexed by me. It is only now I perceive just how perplexing I must"
1047,"have been. ""Of course, she said with that faint stress of apprehension"
1047,"in her eyes, one must have aims."" And, ""it isn't always easy to put"
1047,"everything into phrases."" ""Don't be long,"" said Mrs. Edward Crampton"
1047,"to her husband as the wives trooped out. And afterwards when we went"
1047,"upstairs I had an indefinable persuasion that the ladies had been"
1047,"criticising Britten's share in our talk in an altogether unfavourable"
1047,"spirit. Mrs. Edward evidently thought him aggressive and impertinent,"
1047,"and Margaret with a quiet firmness that brooked no resistance, took him"
1047,"at once into a corner and showed him Italian photographs by Coburn. We"
1047,"dispersed early."
1047,""
1047,"I walked with Britten along the Chelsea back streets towards Battersea"
1047,"Bridge--he lodged on the south side."
1047,""
1047,"""Mrs. Millingham's a dear,"" he began."
1047,""
1047,"""She's a dear."""
1047,""
1047,"""I liked her demand for a hansom because a four-wheeler was too safe."""
1047,""
1047,"""She was worked up,"" I said. ""She's a woman of faultless character, but"
1047,"her instincts, as Altiora would say, are anarchistic--when she gives"
1047,"them a chance."""
1047,""
1047,"""So she takes it out in hansom cabs."""
1047,""
1047,"""Hansom cabs."""
1047,""
1047,"""She's wise,"" said Britten...."
1047,""
1047,"""I hope, Remington,"" he went on after a pause, ""I didn't rag your other"
1047,"guests too much. I've a sort of feeling at moments--Remington, those"
1047,"chaps are so infernally not--not bloody. It's part of a man's duty"
1047,"sometimes at least to eat red beef and get drunk. How is he to"
1047,"understand government if he doesn't? It scares me to think of your"
1047,"lot--by a sort of misapprehension--being in power. A kind of neuralgia"
1047,"in the head, by way of government. I don't understand where YOU come in."
1047,"Those others--they've no lusts. Their ideal is anaemia. You and I,"
1047,"we had at least a lust to take hold of life and make something of it."
1047,"They--they want to take hold of life and make nothing of it. They want"
1047,"to cut out all the stimulants. Just as though life was anything else but"
1047,"a reaction to stimulation!""..."
1047,""
1047,"He began to talk of his own life. He had had ill-fortune through most"
1047,"of it. He was poor and unsuccessful, and a girl he had been very fond"
1047,"of had been attacked and killed by a horse in a field in a very horrible"
1047,"manner. These things had wounded and tortured him, but they hadn't"
1047,"broken him. They had, it seemed to me, made a kind of crippled and ugly"
1047,"demigod of him. He was, I began to perceive, so much better than I had"
1047,"any right to expect. At first I had been rather struck by his unkempt"
1047,"look, and it made my reaction all the stronger. There was about him"
1047,"something, a kind of raw and bleeding faith in the deep things of"
1047,"life, that stirred me profoundly as he showed it. My set of people had"
1047,"irritated him and disappointed him. I discovered at his touch how they"
1047,"irritated him. He reproached me boldly. He made me feel ashamed of my"
1047,"easy acquiescences as I walked in my sleek tall neatness beside his"
1047,"rather old coat, his rather battered hat, his sturdier shorter shape,"
1047,"and listened to his denunciations of our self-satisfied New Liberalism"
1047,"and Progressivism."
1047,""
1047,"""It has the same relation to progress--the reality of progress--that the"
1047,"things they paint on door panels in the suburbs have to art and beauty."
1047,"There's a sort of filiation.... Your Altiora's just the political"
1047,"equivalent of the ladies who sell traced cloth for embroidery; she's"
1047,"a dealer in Refined Social Reform for the Parlour. The real progress,"
1047,"Remington, is a graver thing and a painfuller thing and a slower thing"
1047,"altogether. Look! THAT""--and he pointed to where under a boarding in the"
1047,"light of a gas lamp a dingy prostitute stood lurking--""was in Babylon"

1047,"sort after this Parliament! They're going to vanish at a few top notes"
1047,"from Altiora Bailey! Remington!--it's foolery. It's prigs at play."
1047,"It's make-believe, make-believe! Your people there haven't got hold of"
1047,"things, aren't beginning to get hold of things, don't know anything of"
1047,"life at all, shirk life, avoid life, get in little bright clean rooms"
1047,"and talk big over your bumpers of lemonade while the Night goes by"
1047,"outside--untouched. Those Crampton fools slink by all this,""--he"
1047,"waved at the woman again--""pretend it doesn't exist, or is going to be"
1047,"banished root and branch by an Act to keep children in the wet outside"
1047,"public-houses. Do you think they really care, Remington? I don't. It's"
1047,"make-believe. What they want to do, what Lewis wants to do, what Mrs."
1047,"Bunting Harblow wants her husband to do, is to sit and feel very grave"
1047,"and necessary and respected on the Government benches. They think of"
1047,"putting their feet out like statesmen, and tilting shiny hats with"
1047,"becoming brims down over their successful noses. Presentation portrait"
1047,"to a club at fifty. That's their Reality. That's their scope. They"
1047,"don't, it's manifest, WANT to think beyond that. The things there ARE,"
1047,"Remington, they'll never face! the wonder and the depth of life,--lust,"
1047,"and the night-sky,--pain."""
1047,""
1047,"""But the good intention,"" I pleaded, ""the Good Will!"""

1047,"fleets about the world. The crowded, darkly shining river goes flooding"

1047,"had to speak with quite the same sideways twist that the arrangement of"
1047,"the House imposes. One does not recognise one's own voice threading out"

1047,"auditor. I had no sense of whither my sentences were going, such as one"

1047,"and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with"
1047,"innumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its"
1047,"magazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and"

1047,"narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups"
1047,"are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are duologues,"
1047,"and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first"
1047,"one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were"
1047,"linking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just"
1047,"visit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the"

1047,"dealing with a sort of human mosaic; that each patch in that great place"
1047,"is of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed"
1047,"with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in"
1047,"the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores"
1047,"are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here a clump"
1047,"of men from the North Country or the Potteries, here an island of"
1047,"South London politicians, here a couple of young Jews ascendant from"
1047,"Whitechapel, here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of"
1047,"Irish politicians, here two East Indians, here a priest or so, here"
1047,"a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent"
1047,"Rationalists indulging in a blasphemous story SOTTO VOCE. Next them are"

1047,"For a time I turned towards the Socialists. They at least had an air of"
1047,"coherent intentions. At that time Socialism had come into politics again"
1047,"after a period of depression and obscurity, with a tremendous ECLAT."
1047,"There was visibly a following of Socialist members to Chris Robinson;"
1047,"mysteriously uncommunicative gentlemen in soft felt hats and short"
1047,"coats and square-toed boots who replied to casual advances a little"
1047,"surprisingly in rich North Country dialects. Members became aware of a"
1047,"""seagreen incorruptible,"" as Colonel Marlow put it to me, speaking on"
1047,"the Address, a slender twisted figure supporting itself on a stick and"
1047,"speaking with a fire that was altogether revolutionary. This was Philip"
1047,"Snowden, the member for Blackburn. They had come in nearly forty"
1047,"strong altogether, and with an air of presently meaning to come in much"
1047,"stronger. They were only one aspect of what seemed at that time a big"
1047,"national movement. Socialist societies, we gathered, were springing up"
1047,"all over the country, and every one was inquiring about Socialism and"
1047,"discussing Socialism. It had taken the Universities with particular"
1047,"force, and any youngster with the slightest intellectual pretension was"
1047,"either actively for or brilliantly against. For a time our Young Liberal"
1047,"group was ostentatiously sympathetic...."
1047,""
1047,"When I think of the Socialists there comes a vivid memory of certain"
1047,"evening gatherings at our house...."
1047,""
1047,"These gatherings had been organised by Margaret as the outcome of"
1047,"a discussion at the Baileys'. Altiora had been very emphatic and"
1047,"uncharitable upon the futility of the Socialist movement. It seemed that"
1047,"even the leaders fought shy of dinner-parties."
1047,""
1047,"""They never meet each other,"" said Altiora, ""much less people on the"
1047,"other side. How can they begin to understand politics until they do"
1047,"that?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Most of them have totally unpresentable wives,"" said Altiora,"
1047,"""totally!"" and quoted instances, ""and they WILL bring them. Or they"
1047,"won't come! Some of the poor creatures have scarcely learnt their table"
1047,"manners. They just make holes in the talk...."""
1047,""
1047,"I thought there was a great deal of truth beneath Altiora's outburst."
1047,"The presentation of the Socialist case seemed very greatly crippled"
1047,"by the want of a common intimacy in its leaders; the want of intimacy"
1047,"didn't at first appear to be more than an accident, and our talk led to"
1047,"Margaret's attempt to get acquaintance and easy intercourse afoot among"
1047,"them and between them and the Young Liberals of our group. She gave a"
1047,"series of weekly dinners, planned, I think, a little too accurately upon"
1047,"Altiora's model, and after each we had as catholic a reception as we"
1047,"could contrive."
1047,""
1047,"Our receptions were indeed, I should think, about as catholic as"
1047,"receptions could be. Margaret found herself with a weekly houseful of"
1047,"insoluble problems in intercourse. One did one's best, but one got a"
1047,"nightmare feeling as the evening wore on."
1047,""
1047,"It was one of the few unanimities of these parties that every one should"
1047,"be a little odd in appearance, funny about the hair or the tie or the"
1047,"shoes or more generally, and that bursts of violent aggression should"
1047,"alternate with an attitude entirely defensive. A number of our guests"
1047,"had an air of waiting for a clue that never came, and stood and sat"
1047,"about silently, mildly amused but not a bit surprised that we did not"
1047,"discover their distinctive Open-Sesames. There was a sprinkling of"
1047,"manifest seers and prophetesses in shapeless garments, far too many, I"
1047,"thought, for really easy social intercourse, and any conversation at any"
1047,"moment was liable to become oracular. One was in a state of tension"
1047,"from first to last; the most innocent remark seemed capable of exploding"
1047,"resentment, and replies came out at the most unexpected angles. We Young"
1047,"Liberals went about puzzled but polite to the gathering we had evoked."
1047,"The Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole wonderfully discreet,"
1047,"superfluous steam is let out far away from home in the Balkans or"
1047,"Africa, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting Harblow,"
1047,"and Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats indicative of the"
1047,"House, or in what is sometimes written of as ""faultless evening dress,"""
1047,"stood about on those evenings, they and their very quietly and simply"
1047,"and expensively dressed little wives, like a datum line amidst lakes and"
1047,"mountains."
1047,""
1047,"I didn't at first see the connection between systematic social"
1047,"reorganisation and arbitrary novelties in dietary and costume, just as"
1047,"I didn't realise why the most comprehensive constructive projects should"
1047,"appear to be supported solely by odd and exceptional personalities."
1047,"On one of these evenings a little group of rather jolly-looking pretty"
1047,"young people seated themselves for no particular reason in a large"
1047,"circle on the floor of my study, and engaged, so far as I could judge,"
1047,"in the game of Hunt the Meaning, the intellectual equivalent of Hunt the"
1047,"Slipper. It must have been that same evening I came upon an unbleached"
1047,"young gentleman before the oval mirror on the landing engaged in"
1047,"removing the remains of an anchovy sandwich from his protruded"
1047,"tongue--visible ends of cress having misled him into the belief that he"
1047,"was dealing with doctrinally permissible food. It was not unusual to be"
1047,"given hand-bills and printed matter by our guests, but there I had"
1047,"the advantage over Lewis, who was too tactful to refuse the stuff, too"
1047,"neatly dressed to pocket it, and had no writing-desk available upon"
1047,"which he could relieve himself in a manner flattering to the giver. So"
1047,"that his hands got fuller and fuller. A relentless, compact little woman"
1047,"in what Margaret declared to be an extremely expensive black dress"
1047,"has also printed herself on my memory; she had set her heart upon my"
1047,"contributing to a weekly periodical in the lentil interest with which"
1047,"she was associated, and I spent much time and care in evading her."
1047,""
1047,"Mingling with the more hygienic types were a number of Anti-Puritan"
1047,"Socialists, bulging with bias against temperance, and breaking out"
1047,"against austere methods of living all over their faces. Their manner"
1047,"was packed with heartiness. They were apt to choke the approaches to"
1047,"the little buffet Margaret had set up downstairs, and there engage in"
1047,"discussions of Determinism--it always seemed to be Determinism--which"
1047,"became heartier and noisier, but never acrimonious even in the small"
1047,"hours. It seemed impossible to settle about this Determinism of"
1047,"theirs--ever. And there were worldly Socialists also. I particularly"
1047,"recall a large, active, buoyant, lady-killing individual with an"
1047,"eyeglass borne upon a broad black ribbon, who swam about us one evening."
1047,"He might have been a slightly frayed actor, in his large frock-coat,"
1047,"his white waistcoat, and the sort of black and white check trousers that"
1047,"twinkle. He had a high-pitched voice with aristocratic intonations, and"
1047,"he seemed to be in a perpetual state of interrogation. ""What are we"
1047,"all he-a for?"" he would ask only too audibly. ""What are we doing he-a?"
1047,"What's the connection?"""
1047,""
1047,"What WAS the connection?"

1047,"We made a special effort with our last assembly in June, 1907. We tried"
1047,"to get something like a representative collection of the parliamentary"
1047,"leaders of Socialism, the various exponents of Socialist thought and a"
1047,"number of Young Liberal thinkers into one room. Dorvil came, and Horatio"
1047,"Bulch; Featherstonehaugh appeared for ten minutes and talked charmingly"
1047,"to Margaret and then vanished again; there was Wilkins the novelist and"
1047,"Toomer and Dr. Tumpany. Chris Robinson stood about for a time in a new"
1047,"comforter, and Magdeberg and Will Pipes and five or six Labour members."
1047,"And on our side we had our particular little group, Bunting Harblow,"
1047,"Crampton, Lewis, all looking as broad-minded and open to conviction as"
1047,"they possibly could, and even occasionally talking out from their bushes"
1047,"almost boldly. But the gathering as a whole refused either to mingle or"
1047,"dispute, and as an experiment in intercourse the evening was a failure."
1047,"Unexpected dissociations appeared between Socialists one had supposed"
1047,"friendly. I could not have imagined it was possible for half so many"
1047,"people to turn their backs on everybody else in such small rooms as"
1047,"ours. But the unsaid things those backs expressed broke out, I remarked,"
1047,"with refreshed virulence in the various organs of the various sections"
1047,"of the party next week."
1047,""
1047,"I talked, I remember, with Dr. Tumpany, a large young man in a still"
1047,"larger professional frock-coat, and with a great shock of very fair"
1047,"hair, who was candidate for some North Country constituency. We"
1047,"discussed the political outlook, and, like so many Socialists at that"
1047,"time, he was full of vague threatenings against the Liberal party. I"
1047,"was struck by a thing in him that I had already observed less vividly in"
1047,"many others of these Socialist leaders, and which gave me at last a clue"
1047,"to the whole business. He behaved exactly like a man in possession of"
1047,"valuable patent rights, who wants to be dealt with. He had an air of"
1047,"having a corner in ideas. Then it flashed into my head that the whole"
1047,"Socialist movement was an attempted corner in ideas...."

1047,""
1047,"""We mustn't confuse Socialism with the Socialists,"" I said; ""that's"
1047,"the moral of it. I suppose if God were to find He had made a mistake in"
1047,"dates or something, and went back and annihilated everybody from Owen"

1047,"I remained in my study for a long time with my thoughts crystallising"

1047,"It was then, I think, that I first apprehended clearly how that"
1047,"opposition to which I have already alluded of the immediate life and the"
1047,"mental hinterland of a man, can be applied to public and social affairs."
1047,"The ideas go on--and no person or party succeeds in embodying them. The"
1047,"reality of human progress never comes to the surface, it is a power"
1047,"in the deeps, an undertow. It goes on in silence while men think, in"
1047,"studies where they write self-forgetfully, in laboratories under the"
1047,"urgency of an impersonal curiosity, in the rare illumination of honest"
1047,"talk, in moments of emotional insight, in thoughtful reading, but not"
1047,"in everyday affairs. Everyday affairs and whatever is made an everyday"
1047,"affair, are transactions of the ostensible self, the being of habits,"
1047,"interests, usage. Temper, vanity, hasty reaction to imitation, personal"
1047,"feeling, are their substance. No man can abolish his immediate self and"
1047,"specialise in the depths; if he attempt that, he simply turns himself"
1047,"into something a little less than the common man. He may have an immense"
1047,"hinterland, but that does not absolve him from a frontage. That is the"
1047,"essential error of the specialist philosopher, the specialist teacher,"
1047,"the specialist publicist. They repudiate frontage; claim to be pure"
1047,"hinterland. That is what bothered me about Codger, about those various"
1047,"schoolmasters who had prepared me for life, about the Baileys and their"
1047,"dream of an official ruling class. A human being who is a philosopher"
1047,"in the first place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the"
1047,"first place, is thereby and inevitably, though he bring God-like gifts"
1047,"to the pretence--a quack. These are attempts to live deep-side"
1047,"shallow, inside out. They produce merely a new pettiness. To understand"
1047,"Socialism, again, is to gain a new breadth of outlook; to join a"
1047,"Socialist organisation is to join a narrow cult which is not even"
1047,"tolerably serviceable in presenting or spreading the ideas for which it"
1047,"stands...."
1047,""
1047,"I perceived I had got something quite fundamental here. It had taken me"
1047,"some years to realise the true relation of the great constructive ideas"
1047,"that swayed me not only to political parties, but to myself. I had"
1047,"been disposed to identify the formulae of some one party with social"
1047,"construction, and to regard the other as necessarily anti-constructive,"
1047,"just as I had been inclined to follow the Baileys in the"
1047,"self-righteousness of supposing myself to be wholly constructive. But I"
1047,"saw now that every man of intellectual freedom and vigour is necessarily"
1047,"constructive-minded nowadays, and that no man is disinterestedly so."
1047,"Each one of us repeats in himself the conflict of the race between the"
1047,"splendour of its possibilities and its immediate associations. We may be"
1047,"shaping immortal things, but we must sleep and answer the dinner gong,"
1047,"and have our salt of flattery and self-approval. In politics a man"
1047,"counts not for what he is in moments of imaginative expansion, but"
1047,"for his common workaday, selfish self; and political parties are held"
1047,"together not by a community of ultimate aims, but by the stabler bond"
1047,"of an accustomed life. Everybody almost is for progress in general, and"
1047,"nearly everybody is opposed to any change, except in so far as gross"
1047,"increments are change, in his particular method of living and behaviour."
1047,"Every party stands essentially for the interests and mental usages of"
1047,"some definite class or group of classes in the exciting community, and"
1047,"every party has its scientific-minded and constructive leading section,"
1047,"with well-defined hinterlands formulating its social functions in a"
1047,"public-spirited form, and its superficial-minded following confessing"
1047,"its meannesses and vanities and prejudices. No class will abolish"
1047,"itself, materially alter its way of life, or drastically reconstruct"
1047,"itself, albeit no class is indisposed to co-operate in the unlimited"
1047,"socialisation of any other class. In that capacity for aggression upon"
1047,"other classes lies the essential driving force of modern affairs. The"
1047,"instincts, the persons, the parties, and vanities sway and struggle."
1047,"The ideas and understandings march on and achieve themselves for all--in"
1047,"spite of every one...."
1047,""
1047,"The methods and traditions of British politics maintain the form of two"
1047,"great parties, with rider groups seeking to gain specific ends in the"
1047,"event of a small Government majority. These two main parties are more or"
1047,"less heterogeneous in composition. Each, however, has certain necessary"
1047,"characteristics. The Conservative Party has always stood quite"
1047,"definitely for the established propertied interests. The land-owner,"
1047,"the big lawyer, the Established Church, and latterly the huge private"
1047,"monopoly of the liquor trade which has been created by temperance"
1047,"legislation, are the essential Conservatives. Interwoven now with the"
1047,"native wealthy are the families of the great international usurers, and"
1047,"a vast miscellaneous mass of financial enterprise. Outside the range of"
1047,"resistance implied by these interests, the Conservative Party has always"
1047,"shown itself just as constructive and collectivist as any other party."
1047,"The great landowners have been as well-disposed towards the endowment"
1047,"of higher education, and as willing to co-operate with the Church in"
1047,"protective and mildly educational legislation for children and the"
1047,"working class, as any political section. The financiers, too, are"
1047,"adventurous-spirited and eager for mechanical progress and technical"
1047,"efficiency. They are prepared to spend public money upon research,"
1047,"upon ports and harbours and public communications, upon sanitation and"
1047,"hygienic organisation. A certain rude benevolence of public intention is"
1047,"equally characteristic of the liquor trade. Provided his comfort leads"
1047,"to no excesses of temperance, the liquor trade is quite eager to see"
1047,"the common man prosperous, happy, and with money to spend in a bar. All"
1047,"sections of the party are aggressively patriotic and favourably inclined"
1047,"to the idea of an upstanding, well-fed, and well-exercised population"
1047,"in uniform. Of course there are reactionary landowners and old-fashioned"
1047,"country clergy, full of localised self-importance, jealous even of the"
1047,"cottager who can read, but they have neither the power nor the ability"
1047,"to retard the constructive forces in the party as a whole. On the other"
1047,"hand, when matters point to any definitely confiscatory proposal, to the"
1047,"public ownership and collective control of land, for example, or"
1047,"state mining and manufactures, or the nationalisation of the so-called"
1047,"public-house or extended municipal enterprise, or even to an increase of"
1047,"the taxation of property, then the Conservative Party presents a nearly"
1047,"adamantine bar. It does not stand for, it IS, the existing arrangement"
1047,"in these affairs."
1047,""
1047,"Even more definitely a class party is the Labour Party, whose immediate"
1047,"interest is to raise wages, shorten hours of labor, increase employment,"
1047,"and make better terms for the working-man tenant and working-man"
1047,"purchaser. Its leaders are no doubt constructive minded, but the mass"
1047,"of the following is naturally suspicious of education and discipline,"
1047,"hostile to the higher education, and--except for an obvious antagonism"
1047,"to employers and property owners--almost destitute of ideas. What"
1047,"else can it be? It stands for the expropriated multitude, whose whole"
1047,"situation and difficulty arise from its individual lack of initiative"
1047,"and organising power. It favours the nationalisation of land and capital"
1047,"with no sense of the difficulties involved in the process; but, on the"
1047,"other hand, the equally reasonable socialisation of individuals which"
1047,"is implied by military service is steadily and quite naturally and quite"
1047,"illogically opposed by it. It is only in recent years that Labour has"
1047,"emerged as a separate party from the huge hospitable caravanserai of"
1047,"Liberalism, and there is still a very marked tendency to step back again"
1047,"into that multitudinous assemblage."
1047,""
1047,"For multitudinousness has always been the Liberal characteristic."
1047,"Liberalism never has been nor ever can be anything but a diversified"
1047,"crowd. Liberalism has to voice everything that is left out by these"
1047,"other parties. It is the party against the predominating interests. It"
1047,"is at once the party of the failing and of the untried; it is the party"
1047,"of decadence and hope. From its nature it must be a vague and planless"
1047,"association in comparison with its antagonist, neither so constructive"
1047,"on the one hand, nor on the other so competent to hinder the inevitable"
1047,"constructions of the civilised state. Essentially it is the party"
1047,"of criticism, the ""Anti"" party. It is a system of hostilities and"
1047,"objections that somehow achieves at times an elusive common soul. It is"
1047,"a gathering together of all the smaller interests which find themselves"
1047,"at a disadvantage against the big established classes, the leasehold"
1047,"tenant as against the landowner, the retail tradesman as against"
1047,"the merchant and the moneylender, the Nonconformist as against the"
1047,"Churchman, the small employer as against the demoralising hospitable"
1047,"publican, the man without introductions and broad connections against"
1047,"the man who has these things. It is the party of the many small men"
1047,"against the fewer prevailing men. It has no more essential reason for"
1047,"loving the Collectivist state than the Conservatives; the small dealer"
1047,"is doomed to absorption in that just as much as the large owner; but"
1047,"it resorts to the state against its antagonists as in the middle ages"
1047,"common men pitted themselves against the barons by siding with the king."
1047,"The Liberal Party is the party against ""class privilege"" because it"
1047,"represents no class advantages, but it is also the party that is on"
1047,"the whole most set against Collective control because it represents"
1047,"no established responsibility. It is constructive only so far as its"
1047,"antagonism to the great owner is more powerful than its jealousy of the"
1047,"state. It organises only because organisation is forced upon it by the"
1047,"organisation of its adversaries. It lapses in and out of alliance with"
1047,"Labour as it sways between hostility to wealth and hostility to public"
1047,"expenditure...."

1047,"Every modern European state will have in some form or other these three"
1047,"parties: the resistent, militant, authoritative, dull, and unsympathetic"
1047,"party of establishment and success, the rich party; the confused,"
1047,"sentimental, spasmodic, numerous party of the small, struggling,"
1047,"various, undisciplined men, the poor man's party; and a third party"
1047,"sometimes detaching itself from the second and sometimes reuniting with"
1047,"it, the party of the altogether expropriated masses, the proletarians,"
1047,"Labour. Change Conservative and Liberal to Republican and Democrat, for"

1047,""
1047,"So it was I sat and thought my problem out.... I still remember my"
1047,"satisfaction at seeing things plainly at last. It was like clouds"
1047,"dispersing to show the sky. Constructive ideas, of course, couldn't hold"
1047,"a party together alone, ""interests and habits, not ideas,"" I had that"
1047,"now, and so the great constructive scheme of Socialism, invading and"
1047,"inspiring all parties, was necessarily claimed only by this collection"
1047,"of odds and ends, this residuum of disconnected and exceptional people."
1047,"This was true not only of the Socialist idea, but of the scientific"
1047,"idea, the idea of veracity--of human confidence in humanity--of all that"
1047,"mattered in human life outside the life of individuals.... The only real"
1047,"party that would ever profess Socialism was the Labour Party, and that"
1047,"in the entirely one-sided form of an irresponsible and non-constructive"
1047,"attack on property. Socialism in that mutilated form, the teeth and"
1047,"claws without the eyes and brain, I wanted as little as I wanted"
1047,"anything in the world."
1047,""
1047,"Perfectly clear it was, perfectly clear, and why hadn't I seen it"

1047,"My ideas about statecraft have passed through three main phases to the"
1047,"final convictions that remain. There was the first immediacy of my dream"
1047,"of ports and harbours and cities, railways, roads, and administered"
1047,"territories--the vision I had seen in the haze from that little church"
1047,"above Locarno. Slowly that had passed into a more elaborate legislative"
1047,"constructiveness, which had led to my uneasy association with the"
1047,"Baileys and the professedly constructive Young Liberals. To get that"
1047,"ordered life I had realised the need of organisation, knowledge,"
1047,"expertness, a wide movement of co-ordinated methods. On the individual"
1047,"side I thought that a life of urgent industry, temperance, and close"
1047,"attention was indicated by my perception of these ends. I married"
1047,"Margaret and set to work. But something in my mind refused from the"
1047,"outset to accept these determinations as final. There was always a doubt"
1047,"lurking below, always a faint resentment, a protesting criticism, a"
1047,"feeling of vitally important omissions."
1047,""
1047,"I arrived at last at the clear realisation that my political associates,"
1047,"and I in my association with them, were oddly narrow, priggish, and"
1047,"unreal, that the Socialists with whom we were attempting co-operation"
1047,"were preposterously irrelevant to their own theories, that my political"
1047,"life didn't in some way comprehend more than itself, that rather"
1047,"perplexingly I was missing the thing I was seeking. Britten's footnotes"
1047,"to Altiora's self-assertions, her fits of energetic planning, her"
1047,"quarrels and rallies and vanities, his illuminating attacks on"
1047,"Cramptonism and the heavy-spirited triviality of such Liberalism as the"
1047,"Children's Charter, served to point my way to my present conclusions."
1047,"I had been trying to deal all along with human progress as something"
1047,"immediate in life, something to be immediately attacked by political"
1047,"parties and groups pointing primarily to that end. I now began to"
1047,"see that just as in my own being there was the rather shallow, rather"
1047,"vulgar, self-seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and"
1047,"bustled self-consciously through the lobby, and a much greater and"
1047,"indefinitely growing unpublished personality behind him--my hinterland,"
1047,"I have called it--so in human affairs generally the permanent reality"
1047,"is also a hinterland, which is never really immediate, which draws"
1047,"continually upon human experience and influences human action more and"
1047,"more, but which is itself never the actual player upon the stage. It is"
1047,"the unseen dramatist who never takes a call. Now it was just through the"
1047,"fact that our group about the Baileys didn't understand this, that with"
1047,"a sort of frantic energy they were trying to develop that sham expert"
1047,"officialdom of theirs to plan, regulate, and direct the affairs of"
1047,"humanity, that the perplexing note of silliness and shallowness that I"
1047,"had always felt and felt now most acutely under Britten's gibes, came"
1047,"in. They were neglecting human life altogether in social organisation."
1047,""
1047,"In the development of intellectual modesty lies the growth of"
1047,"statesmanship. It has been the chronic mistake of statecraft and all"
1047,"organising spirits to attempt immediately to scheme and arrange and"
1047,"achieve. Priests, schools of thought, political schemers, leaders of"
1047,"men, have always slipped into the error of assuming that they can think"
1047,"out the whole--or at any rate completely think out definite parts--of"
1047,"the purpose and future of man, clearly and finally; they have set"
1047,"themselves to legislate and construct on that assumption, and,"
1047,"experiencing the perplexing obduracy and evasions of reality, they have"
1047,"taken to dogma, persecution, training, pruning, secretive education; and"
1047,"all the stupidities of self-sufficient energy. In the passion of their"
1047,"good intentions they have not hesitated to conceal fact, suppress"
1047,"thought, crush disturbing initiatives and apparently detrimental"
1047,"desires. And so it is blunderingly and wastefully, destroying with"
1047,"the making, that any extension of social organisation is at present"
1047,"achieved."
1047,""
1047,"Directly, however, this idea of an emancipation from immediacy is"
1047,"grasped, directly the dominating importance of this critical, less"
1047,"personal, mental hinterland in the individual and of the collective mind"
1047,"in the race is understood, the whole problem of the statesman and"
1047,"his attitude towards politics gain a new significance, and becomes"
1047,"accessible to a new series of solutions. He wants no longer to ""fix"
1047,"up,"" as people say, human affairs, but to devote his forces to the"
1047,"development of that needed intellectual life without which all his"
1047,"shallow attempts at fixing up are futile. He ceases to build on the"
1047,"sands, and sets himself to gather foundations."
1047,""
1047,"You see, I began in my teens by wanting to plan and build cities and"
1047,"harbours for mankind; I ended in the middle thirties by desiring only"
1047,"to serve and increase a general process of thought, a process fearless,"
1047,"critical, real-spirited, that would in its own time give cities,"
1047,"harbours, air, happiness, everything at a scale and quality and in"
1047,"a light altogether beyond the match-striking imaginations of a"
1047,"contemporary mind. I wanted freedom of speech and suggestion, vigour of"
1047,"thought, and the cultivation of that impulse of veracity that lurks"
1047,"more or less discouraged in every man. With that I felt there must go an"
1047,"emotion. I hit upon a phrase that became at last something of a refrain"
1047,"in my speech and writings, to convey the spirit that I felt was at the"
1047,"very heart of real human progress--love and fine thinking."
1047,""
1047,"(I suppose that nowadays no newspaper in England gets through a week"
1047,"without the repetition of that phrase.)"
1047,""
1047,"My convictions crystallised more and more definitely upon this. The"
1047,"more of love and fine thinking the better for men, I said; the less,"
1047,"the worse. And upon this fresh basis I set myself to examine what I as"
1047,"a politician might do. I perceived I was at last finding an adequate"
1047,"expression for all that was in me, for those forces that had rebelled at"
1047,"the crude presentations of Bromstead, at the secrecies and suppressions"
1047,"of my youth, at the dull unrealities of City Merchants, at the"
1047,"conventions and timidities of the Pinky Dinkys, at the philosophical"
1047,"recluse of Trinity and the phrases and tradition-worship of my political"
1047,"associates. None of these things were half alive, and I wanted life to"
1047,"be intensely alive and awake. I wanted thought like an edge of steel and"
1047,"desire like a flame. The real work before mankind now, I realised once"
1047,"and for all, is the enlargement of human expression, the release and"
1047,"intensification of human thought, the vivider utilisation of experience"
1047,"and the invigoration of research--and whatever one does in human affairs"
1047,"has or lacks value as it helps or hinders that."
1047,""
1047,"With that I had got my problem clear, and the solution, so far as I"
1047,"was concerned, lay in finding out the point in the ostensible life of"
1047,"politics at which I could most subserve these ends. I was still against"
1047,"the muddles of Bromstead, but I had hunted them down now to their"
1047,"essential form. The jerry-built slums, the roads that went nowhere,"
1047,"the tarred fences, litigious notice-boards and barbed wire fencing, the"
1047,"litter and the heaps of dump, were only the outward appearances whose"
1047,"ultimate realities were jerry-built conclusions, hasty purposes, aimless"
1047,"habits of thought, and imbecile bars and prohibitions in the thoughts"
1047,"and souls of men. How are we through politics to get at that confusion?"
1047,""
1047,"We want to invigorate and reinvigorate education. We want to create a"
1047,"sustained counter effort to the perpetual tendency of all educational"
1047,"organisations towards classicalism, secondary issues, and the evasion of"
1047,"life."
1047,""
1047,"We want to stimulate the expression of life through art and literature,"
1047,"and its exploration through research."
1047,""
1047,"We want to make the best and finest thought accessible to every one,"
1047,"and more particularly to create and sustain an enormous free criticism,"
1047,"without which art, literature, and research alike degenerate into"
1047,"tradition or imposture."
1047,""
1047,"Then all the other problems which are now so insoluble, destitution,"

1047,"faced possibility of making life generally and continually beautiful,"
1047,"become--EASY...."
1047,""
1047,"It was clear to me that the most vital activities in which I could"
1047,"engage would be those which most directly affected the Church, public"
1047,"habits of thought, education, organised research, literature, and the"
1047,"channels of general discussion. I had to ask myself how my position"
1047,"as Liberal member for Kinghamstead squared with and conduced to this"

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I have told of my gradual abandonment of the pretensions and habits of"
1047,"party Liberalism. In a sense I was moving towards aristocracy. Regarding"
1047,"the development of the social and individual mental hinterland as the"
1047,"essential thing in human progress, I passed on very naturally to the"
1047,"practical assumption that we wanted what I may call ""hinterlanders."" Of"
1047,"course I do not mean by aristocracy the changing unorganised medley of"
1047,"rich people and privileged people who dominate the civilised world of"
1047,"to-day, but as opposed to this, a possibility of co-ordinating the will"
1047,"of the finer individuals, by habit and literature, into a broad common"
1047,"aim. We must have an aristocracy--not of privilege, but of understanding"
1047,"and purpose--or mankind will fail. I find this dawning more and more"
1047,"clearly when I look through my various writings of the years between"
1047,"1903 and 1910. I was already emerging to plain statements in 1908."
1047,""
1047,"I reasoned after this fashion. The line of human improvement and the"
1047,"expansion of human life lies in the direction of education and finer"
1047,"initiatives. If humanity cannot develop an education far beyond anything"
1047,"that is now provided, if it cannot collectively invent devices and solve"
1047,"problems on a much richer, broader scale than it does at the present"
1047,"time, it cannot hope to achieve any very much finer order or any more"
1047,"general happiness than it now enjoys. We must believe, therefore, that"
1047,"it CAN develop such a training and education, or we must abandon secular"
1047,"constructive hope. And here my peculiar difficulty as against crude"
1047,"democracy comes in. If humanity at large is capable of that high"
1047,"education and those creative freedoms our hope demands, much more must"
1047,"its better and more vigorous types be so capable. And if those who have"
1047,"power and leisure now, and freedom to respond to imaginative appeals,"
1047,"cannot be won to the idea of collective self-development, then the whole"
1047,"of humanity cannot be won to that. From that one passes to what"
1047,"has become my general conception in politics, the conception of the"
1047,"constructive imagination working upon the vast complex of powerful"
1047,"people, clever people, enterprising people, influential people, amidst"
1047,"whom power is diffused to-day, to produce that self-conscious, highly"
1047,"selective, open-minded, devoted aristocratic culture, which seems to me"
1047,"to be the necessary next phase in the development of human affairs."
1047,"I see human progress, not as the spontaneous product of crowds of raw"
1047,"minds swayed by elementary needs, but as a natural but elaborate result"
1047,"of intricate human interdependencies, of human energy and curiosity"
1047,"liberated and acting at leisure, of human passions and motives, modified"
1047,"and redirected by literature and art...."
1047,""
1047,"But now the reader will understand how it came about that, disappointed"
1047,"by the essential littleness of Liberalism, and disillusioned about the"
1047,"representative quality of the professed Socialists, I turned my"
1047,"mind more and more to a scrutiny of the big people, the wealthy and"
1047,"influential people, against whom Liberalism pits its forces. I was"
1047,"asking myself definitely whether, after all, it was not my particular"
1047,"job to work through them and not against them. Was I not altogether out"
1047,"of my element as an Anti-? Weren't there big bold qualities about these"
1047,"people that common men lack, and the possibility of far more splendid"
1047,"dreams? Were they really the obstacles, might they not be rather the"
1047,"vehicles of the possible new braveries of life?"

1047,"The faults of the Imperialist movement were obvious enough. The"
1047,"conception of the Boer War had been clumsy and puerile, the costly"
1047,"errors of that struggle appalling, and the subsequent campaign of Mr."
1047,"Chamberlain for Tariff Reform seemed calculated to combine the financial"
1047,"adventurers of the Empire in one vast conspiracy against the consumer."
1047,"The cant of Imperialism was easy to learn and use; it was speedily"
1047,"adopted by all sorts of base enterprises and turned to all sorts of base"
1047,"ends. But a big child is permitted big mischief, and my mind was"
1047,"now continually returning to the persuasion that after all in some"
1047,"development of the idea of Imperial patriotism might be found that wide,"
1047,"rough, politically acceptable expression of a constructive dream capable"
1047,"of sustaining a great educational and philosophical movement such as"
1047,"no formula of Liberalism supplied. The fact that it readily took vulgar"
1047,"forms only witnessed to its strong popular appeal. Mixed in with the"
1047,"noisiness and humbug of the movement there appeared a real regard for"
1047,"social efficiency, a real spirit of animation and enterprise. There"
1047,"suddenly appeared in my world--I saw them first, I think, in 1908--a"
1047,"new sort of little boy, a most agreeable development of the slouching,"
1047,"cunning, cigarette-smoking, town-bred youngster, a small boy in a khaki"
1047,"hat, and with bare knees and athletic bearing, earnestly engaged in"
1047,"wholesome and invigorating games up to and occasionally a little beyond"
1047,"his strength--the Boy Scout. I liked the Boy Scout, and I find it"
1047,"difficult to express how much it mattered to me, with my growing bias in"
1047,"favour of deliberate national training, that Liberalism hadn't been able"
1047,"to produce, and had indeed never attempted to produce, anything of this"

1047,"In those days there existed a dining club called--there was some lost"
1047,"allusion to the exorcism of party feeling in its title--the Pentagram"
1047,"Circle. It included Bailey and Dayton and myself, Sir Herbert Thorns,"
1047,"Lord Charles Kindling, Minns the poet, Gerbault the big railway man,"
1047,"Lord Gane, fresh from the settlement of Framboya, and Rumbold, who later"
1047,"became Home Secretary and left us. We were men of all parties and very"
1047,"various experiences, and our object was to discuss the welfare of the"
1047,"Empire in a disinterested spirit. We dined monthly at the Mermaid in"
1047,"Westminster, and for a couple of years we kept up an average attendance"
1047,"of ten out of fourteen. The dinner-time was given up to desultory"
1047,"conversation, and it is odd how warm and good the social atmosphere of"
1047,"that little gathering became as time went on; then over the dessert, so"
1047,"soon as the waiters had swept away the crumbs and ceased to fret us, one"
1047,"of us would open with perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes' exposition"
1047,"of some specially prepared question, and after him we would deliver"
1047,"ourselves in turn, each for three or four minutes. When every one"
1047,"present had spoken once talk became general again, and it was rare we"
1047,"emerged upon Hendon Street before midnight. Sometimes, as my house"
1047,"was conveniently near, a knot of men would come home with me and go on"
1047,"talking and smoking in my dining-room until two or three. We had Fred"
1047,"Neal, that wild Irish journalist, among us towards the end, and his"
1047,"stupendous flow of words materially prolonged our closing discussions"
1047,"and made our continuance impossible."

1047,"I learned very much and very many things at those dinners, but more"
1047,"particularly did I become familiarised with the habits of mind of such"
1047,"men as Neal, Crupp, Gane, and the one or two other New Imperialists"
1047,"who belonged to us. They were nearly all like Bailey Oxford men, though"
1047,"mostly of a younger generation, and they were all mysteriously and"
1047,"inexplicably advocates of Tariff Reform, as if it were the principal"
1047,"instead of at best a secondary aspect of constructive policy. They"
1047,"seemed obsessed by the idea that streams of trade could be diverted"
1047,"violently so as to link the parts of the Empire by common interests, and"
1047,"they were persuaded, I still think mistakenly, that Tariff Reform would"
1047,"have an immense popular appeal. They were also very keen on military"
1047,"organisation, and with a curious little martinet twist in their minds"
1047,"that boded ill for that side of public liberty. So much against them."
1047,"But they were disposed to spend money much more generously on education"
1047,"and research of all sorts than our formless host of Liberals seemed"
1047,"likely to do; and they were altogether more accessible than the Young"
1047,"Liberals to bold, constructive ideas affecting the universities and"
1047,"upper classes. The Liberals are abjectly afraid of the universities."
1047,"I found myself constantly falling into line with these men in our"
1047,"discussions, and more and more hostile to Dayton's sentimentalising"
1047,"evasions of definite schemes and Minns' trust in such things as the"
1047,"""Spirit of our People"" and the ""General Trend of Progress."" It wasn't"
1047,"that I thought them very much righter than their opponents; I believe"
1047,"all definite party ""sides"" at any time are bound to be about equally"
1047,"right and equally lop-sided; but that I thought I could get more out"
1047,"of them and what was more important to me, more out of myself if I"
1047,"co-operated with them. By 1908 I had already arrived at a point where I"
1047,"could be definitely considering a transfer of my political allegiance."

1047,"menu-cards used for memoranda. I see old Dayton sitting back and cocking"

1047,"It was to the Pentagram Circle that I first broached the new conceptions"
1047,"that were developing in my mind. I count the evening of my paper the"
1047,"beginning of the movement that created the BLUE WEEKLY and our wing of"
1047,"the present New Tory party. I do that without any excessive egotism,"
1047,"because my essay was no solitary man's production; it was my reaction"
1047,"to forces that had come to me very large through my fellow-members; its"
1047,"quick reception by them showed that I was, so to speak, merely the first"
1047,"of the chestnuts to pop. The atmospheric quality of the evening stands"
1047,"out very vividly in my memory. The night, I remember, was warmly foggy"
1047,"when after midnight we went to finish our talk at my house."

1047,"We had recently changed the rules of the club to admit visitors, and"
1047,"so it happened that I had brought Britten, and Crupp introduced Arnold"
1047,"Shoesmith, my former schoolfellow at City Merchants, and now the"
1047,"wealthy successor of his father and elder brother. I remember his heavy,"
1047,"inexpressively handsome face lighting to his rare smile at the sight of"
1047,"me, and how little I dreamt of the tragic entanglement that was destined"
1047,"to involve us both. Gane was present, and Esmeer, a newly-added"
1047,"member, but I think Bailey was absent. Either he was absent, or he said"
1047,"something so entirely characteristic and undistinguished that it has"
1047,"left no impression on my mind."
1047,""
1047,"I had broken a little from the traditions of the club even in my title,"
1047,"which was deliberately a challenge to the liberal idea: it was, ""The"
1047,"World Exists for Exceptional People."" It is not the title I should"
1047,"choose now--for since that time I have got my phrase of ""mental"
1047,"hinterlander"" into journalistic use. I should say now, ""The World Exists"
1047,"for Mental Hinterland."""

1047,"The notes I made of that opening have long since vanished with a"
1047,"thousand other papers, but some odd chance has preserved and brought"
1047,"with me to Italy the menu for the evening; its back black with the"
1047,"scrawled notes I made of the discussion for my reply. I found it the"
1047,"other day among some letters from Margaret and a copy of the 1909 Report"
1047,"of the Poor Law Commission, also rich with pencilled marginalia."
1047,""
1047,"My opening was a criticism of the democratic idea and method, upon lines"
1047,"such as I have already sufficiently indicated in the preceding sections."
1047,"I remember how old Dayton fretted in his chair, and tushed and pished"
1047,"at that, even as I gave it, and afterwards we were treated to one of his"
1047,"platitudinous harangues, he sitting back in his chair with that small"
1047,"obstinate eye of his fixed on the ceiling, and a sort of cadaverous glow"
1047,"upon his face, repeating--quite regardless of all my reasoning and all"
1047,"that had been said by others in the debate--the sacred empty phrases"
1047,"that were his soul's refuge from reality. ""You may think it very"
1047,"clever,"" he said with a nod of his head to mark his sense of his point,"
1047,"""not to Trust in the People. I do."" And so on. Nothing in his life or"
1047,"work had ever shown that he did trust in the people, but that was"
1047,"beside the mark. He was the party Liberal, and these were the party"
1047,"incantations."
1047,""
1047,"After my preliminary attack on vague democracy I went on to show that"
1047,"all human life was virtually aristocratic; people must either recognise"
1047,"aristocracy in general or else follow leaders, which is aristocracy in"
1047,"particular, and so I came to my point that the reality of human progress"
1047,"lay necessarily through the establishment of freedoms for the human best"
1047,"and a collective receptivity and understanding. There was a disgusted"
1047,"grunt from Dayton, ""Superman rubbish--Nietzsche. Shaw! Ugh!"" I sailed on"
1047,"over him to my next propositions. The prime essential in a progressive"
1047,"civilisation was the establishment of a more effective selective process"
1047,"for the privilege of higher education, and the very highest educational"
1047,"opportunity for the educable. We were too apt to patronise scholarship"
1047,"winners, as though a scholarship was toffee given as a reward for"
1047,"virtue. It wasn't any reward at all; it was an invitation to capacity."
1047,"We had no more right to drag in virtue, or any merit but quality, than"
1047,"we had to involve it in a search for the tallest man. We didn't want a"
1047,"mere process for the selection of good as distinguished from gifted and"
1047,"able boys--""No, you DON'T,"" from Dayton--we wanted all the brilliant"
1047,"stuff in the world concentrated upon the development of the world."
1047,"Just to exasperate Dayton further I put in a plea for gifts as against"
1047,"character in educational, artistic, and legislative work. ""Good"
1047,"teaching,"" I said, ""is better than good conduct. We are becoming idiotic"
1047,"about character."""
1047,""
1047,"Dayton was too moved to speak. He slewed round upon me an eye of"
1047,"agonised aversion."
1047,""
1047,"I expatiated on the small proportion of the available ability that is"
1047,"really serving humanity to-day. ""I suppose to-day all the thought, all"
1047,"the art, all the increments of knowledge that matter, are supplied so"
1047,"far as the English-speaking community is concerned by--how many?--by"
1047,"three or four thousand individuals. ('Less,' said Thorns.) To be"
1047,"more precise, by the mental hinterlands of three or four thousand"
1047,"individuals. We who know some of the band entertain no illusions as to"
1047,"their innate rarity. We know that they are just the few out of many, the"
1047,"few who got in our world of chance and confusion, the timely stimulus,"
1047,"the apt suggestion at the fortunate moment, the needed training, the"
1047,"leisure. The rest are lost in the crowd, fail through the defects of"
1047,"their qualities, become commonplace workmen and second-rate professional"
1047,"men, marry commonplace wives, are as much waste as the driftage of"
1047,"superfluous pollen in a pine forest is waste."""
1047,""
1047,"""Decent honest lives!"" said Dayton to his bread-crumbs, with his chin in"
1047,"his necktie. ""WASTE!"""
1047,""
1047,"""And the people who do get what we call opportunity get it usually"
1047,"in extremely limited and cramping forms. No man lives a life of"
1047,"intellectual productivity alone; he needs not only material and"
1047,"opportunity, but helpers, resonators. Round and about what I might"
1047,"call the REAL men, you want the sympathetic cooperators, who help by"
1047,"understanding. It isn't that our--SALT of three or four thousand is"
1047,"needlessly rare; it is sustained by far too small and undifferentiated a"
1047,"public. Most of the good men we know are not really doing the very"
1047,"best work of their gifts; nearly all are a little adapted, most are"
1047,"shockingly adapted to some second-best use. Now, I take it, this is the"
1047,"very centre and origin of the muddle, futility, and unhappiness that"
1047,"distresses us; it's the cardinal problem of the state--to discover,"
1047,"develop, and use the exceptional gifts of men. And I see that best"
1047,"done--I drift more and more away from the common stuff of legislative"
1047,"and administrative activity--by a quite revolutionary development of the"
1047,"educational machinery, but by a still more unprecedented attempt to"
1047,"keep science going, to keep literature going, and to keep what is"
1047,"the necessary spur of all science and literature, an intelligent and"
1047,"appreciative criticism going. You know none of these things have ever"
1047,"been kept going hitherto; they've come unexpectedly and inexplicably."""

1047,"of mystical profundity."

1047,"""They've lit up a civilisation and vanished, to give place to darkness"
1047,"again. Now the modern state doesn't mean to go back to darkness"
1047,"again--and so it's got to keep its light burning."" I went on to attack"
1047,"the present organisation of our schools and universities, which"
1047,"seemed elaborately designed to turn the well-behaved, uncritical, and"
1047,"uncreative men of each generation into the authoritative leaders of the"

1047,"So far I had the substance of the club with me, but I opened new"
1047,"ground and set Crupp agog by confessing my doubt from which party or"

1047,"educational organisation could most reasonably be expected. I looked up"
1047,"to find Crupp's dark little eye intent upon me."

1047,"We had an astonishingly good discussion; Neal burst once, but we emerged"

1047,"all close, keen examination of my problem."

1047,"I see Crupp now with his arm bent before him on the table in a way we"
1047,"had, as though it was jointed throughout its length like a lobster's"
1047,"antenna, his plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a walnut shell into"
1047,"smaller and smaller fragments. ""Remington,"" he said, ""has given us the"
1047,"data for a movement, a really possible movement. It's not only possible,"
1047,"but necessary--urgently necessary, I think, if the Empire is to go on."""

1047,"""We're working altogether too much at the social basement in education"

1047,"higher levels."""

1047,"Britten made a good contribution with an analysis of what he called the"
1047,"spirit of a country and what made it. ""The modern community needs its"
1047,"serious men to be artistic and its artists to be taken seriously,"" I"
1047,"remember his saying. ""The day has gone by for either dull responsibility"
1047,"or merely witty art."""
1047,""
1047,"I remember very vividly how Shoesmith harped on an idea I had thrown out"
1047,"of using some sort of review or weekly to express and elaborate these"
1047,"conceptions of a new, severer, aristocratic culture."
1047,""
1047,"""It would have to be done amazingly well,"" said Britten, and my mind"
1047,"went back to my school days and that ancient enterprise of ours, and how"
1047,"Cossington had rushed it. Well, Cossington had too many papers nowadays"
1047,"to interfere with us, and we perhaps had learnt some defensive devices."
1047,""
1047,"""But this thing has to be linked to some political party,"" said Crupp,"
1047,"with his eye on me. ""You can't get away from that. The Liberals,"" he"
1047,"added, ""have never done anything for research or literature."""
1047,""
1047,"""They had a Royal Commission on the Dramatic Censorship,"" said Thorns,"
1047,"with a note of minute fairness. ""It shows what they were made of,"" he"
1047,"added."
1047,""
1047,"""It's what I've told Remington again and again,"" said Crupp, ""we've"
1047,"got to pick up the tradition of aristocracy, reorganise it, and make it"
1047,"work. But he's certainly suggested a method."""
1047,""
1047,"""There won't be much aristocracy to pick up,"" said Dayton, darkly to the"
1047,"ceiling, ""if the House of Lords throws out the Budget."""
1047,""
1047,"""All the more reason for picking it up,"" said Neal. ""For we can't do"

1047,"It was an odd, fragmentary discussion that night. We were all with ideas"
1047,"in our minds at once fine and imperfect. We threw out suggestions that"
1047,"showed themselves at once far inadequate, and we tried to qualify them"
1047,"by minor self-contradictions. Britten, I think, got more said than any"
1047,"one. ""You all seem to think you want to organise people, particular"
1047,"groups and classes of individuals,"" he insisted. ""It isn't that. That's"
1047,"the standing error of politicians. You want to organise a culture."
1047,"Civilisation isn't a matter of concrete groupings; it's a matter of"
1047,"prevailing ideas. The problem is how to make bold, clear ideas prevail."

1047,"""Look here, Thorns!"" said I. ""If this Budget row leads to a storm, and"
1047,"these big people get their power clipped, what's going to happen? Have"

1047,""
1047,"""Quacks with a certificate of approval from Altiora,"" said Thorns. ""I"

1047,"""One may go on trying possibilities for ever,"" I said. ""One thing"

1047,"consciously needs, a culture of fine creative minds, and all the"
1047,"necessary tolerances, opennesses, considerations, that march with that."
1047,"For my own part, I think that is the Most Vital Thing. Build your ship"
1047,"of state as you will; get your men as you will; I concentrate on what is"
1047,"clearly the affair of my sort of man,--I want to ensure the quality of"
1047,"the quarter deck."""
1047,""
1047,"""Hear, hear!"" said Shoesmith, suddenly--his first remark for a long"
1047,"time. ""A first-rate figure,"" said Shoesmith, gripping it."
1047,""
1047,"""Our danger is in missing that,"" I went on. ""Muddle isn't ended by"
1047,"transferring power from the muddle-headed few to the muddle-headed"
1047,"many, and then cheating the many out of it again in the interests of"
1047,"a bureaucracy of sham experts. But that seems the limit of the liberal"
1047,"imagination. There is no real progress in a country, except a rise"
1047,"in the level of its free intellectual activity. All other progress is"
1047,"secondary and dependant. If you take on Bailey's dreams of efficient"
1047,"machinery and a sort of fanatical discipline with no free-moving brains"
1047,"behind it, confused ugliness becomes rigid ugliness,--that's all."
1047,"No doubt things are moving from looseness to discipline, and from"
1047,"irresponsible controls to organised controls--and also and rather"
1047,"contrariwise everything is becoming as people say, democratised; but"
1047,"all the more need in that, for an ark in which the living element may be"

1047,"It must have been in my house afterwards that Shoesmith became"
1047,"noticeable. He seemed trying to say something vague and difficult that"
1047,"he didn't get said at all on that occasion. ""We could do immense things"
1047,"with a weekly,"" he repeated, echoing Neal, I think. And there he left"
1047,"off and became a mute expressiveness, and it was only afterwards, when I"
1047,"was in bed, that I saw we had our capitalist in our hands...."

1047,"We parted that night on my doorstep in a tremendous glow--but in that"

1047,"I find my thoughts lingering about the Pentagram Circle. In my"
1047,"developments it played a large part, not so much by starting new trains"
1047,"of thought as by confirming the practicability of things I had already"
1047,"hesitatingly entertained. Discussion with these other men so prominently"
1047,"involved in current affairs endorsed views that otherwise would have"
1047,"seemed only a little less remote from actuality than the guardians of"
1047,"Plato or the labour laws of More. Among other questions that were never"
1047,"very distant from our discussions, that came apt to every topic, was"
1047,"the true significance of democracy, Tariff Reform as a method of"
1047,"international hostility, and the imminence of war. On the first issue"
1047,"I can still recall little Bailey, glib and winking, explaining that"
1047,"democracy was really just a dodge for getting assent to the ordinances"
1047,"of the expert official by means of the polling booth. ""If they don't"
1047,"like things,"" said he, ""they can vote for the opposition candidate"
1047,"and see what happens then--and that, you see, is why we don't want"
1047,"proportional representation to let in the wild men."" I opened my"
1047,"eyes--the lids had dropped for a moment under the caress of those smooth"
1047,"sounds--to see if Bailey's artful forefinger wasn't at the side of his"
1047,"predominant nose."
1047,""
1047,"The international situation exercised us greatly. Our meetings were"
1047,"pervaded by the feeling that all things moved towards a day of"
1047,"reckoning with Germany, and I was largely instrumental in keeping up"
1047,"the suggestion that India was in a state of unstable equilibrium, that"
1047,"sooner or later something must happen there--something very serious to"
1047,"our Empire. Dayton frankly detested these topics. He was full of"
1047,"that old Middle Victorian persuasion that whatever is inconvenient or"
1047,"disagreeable to the English mind could be annihilated by not thinking"
1047,"about it. He used to sit low in his chair and look mulish. ""Militarism,"""
1047,"he would declare in a tone of the utmost moral fervour, ""is a curse."
1047,"It's an unmitigated curse."" Then he would cough shortly and twitch his"
1047,"head back and frown, and seem astonished beyond measure that after this"
1047,"conclusive statement we could still go on talking of war."

1047,"All our Imperialists were obsessed by the thought of international"
1047,"conflict, and their influence revived for a time those uneasinesses that"
1047,"had been aroused in me for the first time by my continental journey"
1047,"with Willersley and by Meredith's ""One of Our Conquerors."" That"
1047,"quite justifiable dread of a punishment for all the slackness, mental"
1047,"dishonesty, presumption, mercenary respectability and sentimentalised"
1047,"commercialism of the Victorian period, at the hands of the better"
1047,"organised, more vigorous, and now far more highly civilised peoples"
1047,"of Central Europe, seemed to me to have both a good and bad series of"
1047,"consequences. It seemed the only thing capable of bracing English minds"
1047,"to education, sustained constructive effort and research; but on the"
1047,"other hand it produced the quality of a panic, hasty preparation,"
1047,"impatience of thought, a wasteful and sometimes quite futile immediacy."
1047,"In 1909, for example, there was a vast clamour for eight additional"
1047,"Dreadnoughts--"

1047,"     ""We want eight"

1047,"but no clamour at all about our national waste of inventive talent, our"
1047,"mean standard of intellectual attainment, our disingenuous criticism,"
1047,"and the consequent failure to distinguish men of the quality needed to"
1047,"carry on the modern type of war. Almost universally we have the wrong"
1047,"men in our places of responsibility and the right men in no place"
1047,"at all, almost universally we have poorly qualified, hesitating, and"
1047,"resentful subordinates, because our criticism is worthless and, so"
1047,"habitually as to be now almost unconsciously, dishonest. Germany is"
1047,"beating England in every matter upon which competition is possible,"
1047,"because she attended sedulously to her collective mind for sixty"
1047,"pregnant years, because in spite of tremendous defects she is still far"
1047,"more anxious for quality in achievement than we are. I remember saying"
1047,"that in my paper. From that, I remember, I went on to an image that had"
1047,"flashed into my mind. ""The British Empire,"" I said, ""is like some of"
1047,"those early vertebrated monsters, the Brontosaurus and the Atlantosaurus"
1047,"and such-like; it sacrifices intellect to character; its backbone,"
1047,"that is to say,--especially in the visceral region--is bigger than its"
1047,"cranium. It's no accident that things are so. We've worked for backbone."
1047,"We brag about backbone, and if the joints are anchylosed so much the"
1047,"better. We're still but only half awake to our error. You can't change"

1047,"do not think there is any such heroic quality in our governing class"
1047,"as will make that war catastrophic. The prevailing spirit in English"
1047,"life--it is one of the essential secrets of our imperial endurance--is"
1047,"one of underbred aggression in prosperity and diplomatic compromise in"
1047,"moments of danger; we bully haughtily where we can and assimilate where"
1047,"we must. It is not for nothing that our upper and middle-class youth is"
1047,"educated by teachers of the highest character, scholars and gentlemen,"
1047,"men who can pretend quite honestly that Darwinism hasn't upset the"
1047,"historical fall of man, that cricket is moral training, and that"
1047,"Socialism is an outrage upon the teachings of Christ. A sort of"
1047,"dignified dexterity of evasion is the national reward. Germany, with a"
1047,"larger population, a vigorous and irreconcilable proletariat, a bolder"
1047,"intellectual training, a harsher spirit, can scarcely fail to drive us"
1047,"at last to a realisation of intolerable strain. So we may never fight at"
1047,"all. The war of preparations that has been going on for thirty years may"
1047,"end like a sham-fight at last in an umpire's decision. We shall proudly"
1047,"but very firmly take the second place. For my own part, since I love"
1047,"England as much as I detest her present lethargy of soul, I pray for a"
1047,"chastening war--I wouldn't mind her flag in the dirt if only her spirit"
1047,"would come out of it. So I was able to shake off that earlier fear of"
1047,"some final and irrevocable destruction truncating all my schemes. At the"
1047,"most, a European war would be a dramatic episode in the reconstruction I"
1047,"had in view."
1047,""
1047,"In India, too, I no longer foresee, as once I was inclined to"
1047,"see, disaster. The English rule in India is surely one of the most"
1047,"extraordinary accidents that has ever happened in history. We are there"
1047,"like a man who has fallen off a ladder on to the neck of an elephant,"
1047,"and doesn't know what to do or how to get down. Until something happens"
1047,"he remains. Our functions in India are absurd. We English do not own"
1047,"that country, do not even rule it. We make nothing happen; at the most"
1047,"we prevent things happening. We suppress our own literature there. Most"
1047,"English people cannot even go to this land they possess; the authorities"
1047,"would prevent it. If Messrs. Perowne or Cook organised a cheap tour"
1047,"of Manchester operatives, it would be stopped. No one dare bring the"
1047,"average English voter face to face with the reality of India, or let"
1047,"the Indian native have a glimpse of the English voter. In my time I"
1047,"have talked to English statesmen, Indian officials and ex-officials,"
1047,"viceroys, soldiers, every one who might be supposed to know what India"
1047,"signifies, and I have prayed them to tell me what they thought we were"
1047,"up to there. I am not writing without my book in these matters. And"
1047,"beyond a phrase or so about ""even-handed justice""--and look at our"
1047,"sedition trials!--they told me nothing. Time after time I have heard"
1047,"of that apocryphal native ruler in the north-west, who, when asked what"
1047,"would happen if we left India, replied that in a week his men would be"
1047,"in the saddle, and in six months not a rupee nor a virgin would be left"
1047,"in Lower Bengal. That is always given as our conclusive justification."
1047,"But is it our business to preserve the rupees and virgins of Lower"
1047,"Bengal in a sort of magic inconclusiveness? Better plunder than"
1047,"paralysis, better fire and sword than futility. Our flag is spread over"
1047,"the peninsula, without plans, without intentions--a vast preventive."
1047,"The sum total of our policy is to arrest any discussion, any conferences"
1047,"that would enable the Indians to work out a tolerable scheme of the"
1047,"future for themselves. But that does not arrest the resentment of men"
1047,"held back from life. Consider what it must be for the educated Indian"
1047,"sitting at the feast of contemporary possibilities with his mouth gagged"
1047,"and his hands bound behind him! The spirit of insurrection breaks out"
1047,"in spite of espionage and seizures. Our conflict for inaction develops"
1047,"stupendous absurdities. The other day the British Empire was taking off"
1047,"and examining printed cotton stomach wraps for seditious emblems and"
1047,"inscriptions...."
1047,""
1047,"In some manner we shall have to come out of India. We have had our"
1047,"chance, and we have demonstrated nothing but the appalling dulness of"
1047,"our national imagination. We are not good enough to do anything with"
1047,"India. Codger and Flack, and Gates and Dayton, Cladingbowl in the club,"
1047,"and the HOME CHURCHMAN in the home, cant about ""character,"" worship"
1047,"of strenuous force and contempt of truth; for the sake of such men and"
1047,"things as these, we must abandon in fact, if not in appearance, that"
1047,"empty domination. Had we great schools and a powerful teaching, could we"
1047,"boast great men, had we the spirit of truth and creation in our lives,"
1047,"then indeed it might be different. But a race that bears a sceptre must"
1047,"carry gifts to justify it."
1047,""
1047,"It does not follow that we shall be driven catastrophically from India."
1047,"That was my earlier mistake. We are not proud enough in our bones to be"
1047,"ruined by India as Spain was by her empire. We may be able to abandon"
1047,"India with an air of still remaining there. It is our new method. We"
1047,"train our future rulers in the public schools to have a very wholesome"
1047,"respect for strength, and as soon as a power arises in India in spite of"
1047,"us, be it a man or a culture, or a native state, we shall be willing to"
1047,"deal with it. We may or may not have a war, but our governing class will"
1047,"be quick to learn when we are beaten. Then they will repeat our South"
1047,"African diplomacy, and arrange for some settlement that will abandon"
1047,"the reality, such as it is, and preserve the semblance of power. The"
1047,"conqueror DE FACTO will become the new ""loyal Briton,"" and the democracy"
1047,"at home will be invited to celebrate our recession--triumphantly. I am"
1047,"no believer in the imminent dissolution of our Empire; I am less and"
1047,"less inclined to see in either India or Germany the probability of an"
1047,"abrupt truncation of those slow intellectual and moral constructions"

1047,"saloons with polished floors and wonderful pictures, and staircases and"
1047,"galleries on a Gargantuan scale. And there she sought to gather all"
1047,"that was most representative of English activities, and did, in fact, in"

1047,"the last triumph of naturalness. Always for me he has been the typical"

1047,"stand alone without an equal, the greatest man in British political"

1047,"into or round because they are of opaque clay, but about Evesham I had a"
1047,"sense of things hidden as it were by depth and mists, because he was so"
1047,"big and atmospheric a personality. No other contemporary has had that"
1047,"effect upon me. I've sat beside him at dinners, stayed in houses with"

1047,"sounded him, watching him as I sat beside him. I could talk to him with"
1047,"extraordinary freedom and a rare sense of being understood. Other men"
1047,"have to be treated in a special manner; approached through their own"
1047,"mental dialect, flattered by a minute regard for what they have said and"
1047,"done. Evesham was as widely and charitably receptive as any man I have"

1047,"""I feel so much,"" he said, ""that the best people in every party"
1047,"converge. We don't differ at Westminster as they do in the country"
1047,"towns. There's a sort of extending common policy that goes on under"
1047,"every government, because on the whole it's the right thing to do, and"
1047,"people know it. Things that used to be matters of opinion become matters"
1047,"of science--and cease to be party questions."""

1047,"the narrowness and passion of his side? Or did he see far beyond my"

1047,"no more of him than a clever man happily circumstanced, and finding an"
1047,"interest and occupation in politics. And then came a glimpse of thought,"
1047,"of imagination, like the sight of a soaring eagle through a staircase"

1047,"sympathetically the great contrast between warm, personal things and the"
1047,"white dream of statecraft. Except that he had it seemed no hot passions,"
1047,"but only interests and fine affections and indolences, he paralleled the"
1047,"conflict of my life. He saw and thought widely and deeply; but at times"
1047,"it seemed to me his greatness stood over and behind the reality of his"

1047,"my heart. Had he really embodied the attempt to realise that, I could"
1047,"have done no more than follow him blindly. But neither he nor I embodied"
1047,"that, and there lies the gist of my story. And when it came to a study"
1047,"of others among the leading Tories and Imperialists the doubt increased,"
1047,"until with some at last it was possible to question whether they had any"
1047,"imaginative conception of constructive statecraft at all; whether they"
1047,"didn't opaquely accept the world for what it was, and set themselves"
1047,"single-mindedly to make a place for themselves and cut a figure in it."
1047,""
1047,"There were some very fine personalities among them: there were the great"
1047,"peers who had administered Egypt, India, South Africa, Framboya--Cromer,"
1047,"Kitchener, Curzon, Milner, Gane, for example. So far as that easier"
1047,"task of holding sword and scales had gone, they had shown the finest"
1047,"qualities, but they had returned to the perplexing and exacting problem"
1047,"of the home country, a little glorious, a little too simply bold. They"
1047,"wanted to arm and they wanted to educate, but the habit of immediate"
1047,"necessity made them far more eager to arm than to educate, and their"
1047,"experience of heterogeneous controls made them overrate the need for"
1047,"obedience in a homogeneous country. They didn't understand raw men,"
1047,"ill-trained men, uncertain minds, and intelligent women; and these are"
1047,"the things that matter in England.... There were also the great business"
1047,"adventurers, from Cranber to Cossington (who was now Lord Paddockhurst)."
1047,"My mind remained unsettled, and went up and down the scale between"
1047,"a belief in their far-sighted purpose and the perception of crude"
1047,"vanities, coarse ambitions, vulgar competitiveness, and a mere habitual"
1047,"persistence in the pursuit of gain. For a time I saw a good deal of"
1047,"Cossington--I wish I had kept a diary of his talk and gestures, to mark"
1047,"how he could vary from day to day between a POSEUR, a smart tradesman,"
1047,"and a very bold and wide-thinking political schemer. He had a vanity"
1047,"of sweeping actions, motor car pounces, Napoleonic rushes, that led to"
1047,"violent ineffectual changes in the policy of his papers, and a haunting"
1047,"pursuit by parallel columns in the liberal press that never abashed him"
1047,"in the slightest degree. By an accident I plumbed the folly in him--but"
1047,"I feel I never plumbed his wisdom. I remember him one day after a lunch"
1047,"at the Barhams' saying suddenly, out of profound meditation over the end"
1047,"of a cigar, one of those sentences that seem to light the whole interior"
1047,"being of a man. ""Some day,"" he said softly, rather to himself than to"
1047,"me, and A PROPOS of nothing--""some day I will raise the country."""
1047,""
1047,"""Why not?"" I said, after a pause, and leant across him for the little"
1047,"silver spirit-lamp, to light my cigarette...."

1047,"Then the Tories had for another section the ancient creations, and again"
1047,"there were the financial peers, men accustomed to reserve, and their big"
1047,"lawyers, accustomed to--well, qualified statement. And below the giant"
1047,"personalities of the party were the young bloods, young, adventurous men"
1047,"of the type of Lord Tarvrille, who had seen service in South Africa,"
1047,"who had travelled and hunted; explorers, keen motorists, interested"
1047,"in aviation, active in army organisation. Good, brown-faced stuff they"
1047,"were, but impervious to ideas outside the range of their activities,"
1047,"more ignorant of science than their chauffeurs, and of the quality"
1047,"of English people than welt-politicians; contemptuous of school and"
1047,"university by reason of the Gateses and Flacks and Codgers who had come"
1047,"their way, witty, light-hearted, patriotic at the Kipling level, with"
1047,"a certain aptitude for bullying. They varied in insensible gradations"
1047,"between the noble sportsmen on the one hand, and men like Gane and the"
1047,"Tories of our Pentagram club on the other. You perceive how a man"
1047,"might exercise his mind in the attempt to strike an average of public"
1047,"serviceability in this miscellany! And mixed up with these, mixed up"
1047,"sometimes in the same man, was the pure reactionary, whose predominant"
1047,"idea was that the village schools should confine themselves to teaching"
1047,"the catechism, hat-touching and courtesying, and be given a holiday"
1047,"whenever beaters were in request...."

1047,"I find now in my mind as a sort of counterpoise to Evesham the figure"
1047,"of old Lord Wardingham, asleep in the largest armchair in the library"
1047,"of Stamford Court after lunch. One foot rested on one of those things--I"
1047,"think they are called gout stools. He had been playing golf all the"
1047,"morning and wearied a weak instep; at lunch he had sat at my table and"
1047,"talked in the overbearing manner permitted to irascible important men"
1047,"whose insteps are painful. Among other things he had flouted the idea"
1047,"that women would ever understand statecraft or be more than a nuisance"
1047,"in politics, denied flatly that Hindoos were capable of anything"
1047,"whatever except excesses in population, regretted he could not"
1047,"censor picture galleries and circulating libraries, and declared that"
1047,"dissenters were people who pretended to take theology seriously with the"
1047,"express purpose of upsetting the entirely satisfactory compromise of the"
1047,"Established Church. ""No sensible people, with anything to gain or lose,"
1047,"argue about religion,"" he said. ""They mean mischief."" Having delivered"
1047,"his soul upon these points, and silenced the little conversation to the"
1047,"left of him from which they had arisen, he became, after an appreciative"
1047,"encounter with a sanguinary woodcock, more amiable, responded to some"
1047,"respectful initiatives of Crupp's, and related a number of classical"
1047,"anecdotes of those blighting snubs, vindictive retorts and scandalous"
1047,"miscarriages of justice that are so dear to the forensic mind. Now he"
1047,"reposed. He was breathing heavily with his mouth a little open and his"
1047,"head on one side. One whisker was turned back against the comfortable"
1047,"padding. His plump strong hands gripped the arms of his chair, and his"
1047,"frown was a little assuaged. How tremendously fed up he looked! Honours,"
1047,"wealth, influence, respect, he had them all. How scornful and hard it"
1047,"had made his unguarded expression!"

1047,"One countervailing influence to my drift to Toryism in those days was"
1047,"Margaret's quite religious faith in the Liberals. I realised that slowly"
1047,"and with a mild astonishment. It set me, indeed, even then questioning"
1047,"my own change of opinion. We came at last incidentally, as our way was,"
1047,"to an exchange of views. It was as nearly a quarrel as we had before"
1047,"I came over to the Conservative side. It was at Champneys, and I think"
1047,"during the same visit that witnessed my exploration of Lady Forthundred."
1047,"It arose indirectly, I think, out of some comments of mine upon our"
1047,"fellow-guests, but it is one of those memories of which the scene and"

1047,"very definite beginning or end. It was afternoon, in the pause between"

1047,"in that splendid room, with its glitter and white reflections and"

1047,"wanted to get at her conception in the sharpest, hardest lines that were"

1047,"""WE!"" cried Margaret. ""How can you say that? It's against us."""
1047,""
1047,"""Naturally. But we made it a monopoly in our clumsy efforts to prevent"

1047,""
1047,"""I wish,"" she said, with something like a sob in her voice, ""it were"
1047,"possible that you shouldn't do this."" She stopped abruptly, and I did"
1047,"not look at her, because I could feel the effort she was making to"
1047,"control herself."
1047,""
1047,"""I thought,"" she began again, ""when you came into Parliament--"""
1047,""
1047,"There came another silence. ""It's all gone so differently,"" she said."
1047,"""Everything has gone so differently."""
1047,""
1047,"I had a sudden memory of her, shining triumphant after the Kinghampstead"
1047,"election, and for the first time I realised just how perplexing and"
1047,"disappointing my subsequent career must have been to her."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm not doing this without consideration,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""I know,"" she said, in a voice of despair, ""I've seen it coming. But--I"
1047,"still don't understand it. I don't understand how you can go over."""
1047,""
1047,"""My ideas have changed and developed,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"I walked across to her bearskin hearthrug, and stood by the mantel."
1047,""
1047,"""To think that you,"" she said; ""you who might have been leader--"" She"
1047,"could not finish it. ""All the forces of reaction,"" she threw out."
1047,""
1047,"""I don't think they are the forces of reaction,"" I said. ""I think I can"
1047,"find work to do--better work on that side."""
1047,""
1047,"""Against us!"" she said. ""As if progress wasn't hard enough! As if it"
1047,"didn't call upon every able man!"""
1047,""
1047,"""I don't think Liberalism has a monopoly of progress."""
1047,""
1047,"She did not answer that. She sat quite still looking in front of her."
1047,"""WHY have you gone over?"" she asked abruptly as though I had said"
1047,"nothing."
1047,""
1047,"There came a silence that I was impelled to end. I began a stiff"
1047,"dissertation from the hearthrug. ""I am going over, because I think I"
1047,"may join in an intellectual renascence on the Conservative side. I"
1047,"think that in the coming struggle there will be a partial and altogether"
1047,"confused and demoralising victory for democracy, that will stir the"
1047,"classes which now dominate the Conservative party into an energetic"
1047,"revival. They will set out to win back, and win back. Even if my"
1047,"estimate of contemporary forces is wrong and they win, they will still"
1047,"be forced to reconstruct their outlook. A war abroad will supply the"
1047,"chastening if home politics fail. The effort at renascence is bound to"
1047,"come by either alternative. I believe I can do more in relation to"
1047,"that effort than in any other connexion in the world of politics at the"
1047,"present time. That's my case, Margaret."""
1047,""
1047,"She certainly did not grasp what I said. ""And so you will throw aside"
1047,"all the beginnings, all the beliefs and pledges--"" Again her sentence"
1047,"remained incomplete. ""I doubt if even, once you have gone over, they"
1047,"will welcome you."""
1047,""
1047,"""That hardly matters."""
1047,""
1047,"I made an effort to resume my speech."
1047,""
1047,"""I came into Parliament, Margaret,"" I said, ""a little prematurely."
1047,"Still--I suppose it was only by coming into Parliament that I could see"
1047,"things as I do now in terms of personality and imaginative range...."""
1047,"I stopped. Her stiff, unhappy, unlistening silence broke up my"
1047,"disquisition."
1047,""
1047,"""After all,"" I remarked, ""most of this has been implicit in my"
1047,"writings."""
1047,""
1047,"She made no sign of admission."
1047,""
1047,"""What are you going to do?"" she asked."
1047,""
1047,"""Keep my seat for a time and make the reasons of my breach clear. Then"
1047,"either I must resign or--probably this new Budget will lead to a"
1047,"General Election. It's evidently meant to strain the Lords and provoke a"
1047,"quarrel."""
1047,""
1047,"""You might, I think, have stayed to fight for the Budget."""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm not,"" I said, ""so keen against the Lords."""

1047,"On that we halted."
1047,""
1047,"""But what are you going to do?"" she asked."
1047,""
1047,"""I shall make my quarrel over some points in the Budget. I can't quite"
1047,"tell you yet where my chance will come. Then I shall either resign my"
1047,"seat--or if things drift to dissolution I shall stand again."""
1047,""
1047,"""It's political suicide."""
1047,""
1047,"""Not altogether."""
1047,""
1047,"""I can't imagine you out of Parliament again. It's just like--like"
1047,"undoing all we have done. What will you do?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Write. Make a new, more definite place for myself. You know, of course,"
1047,"there's already a sort of group about Crupp and Gane."""
1047,""
1047,"Margaret seemed lost for a time in painful thought."
1047,""
1047,"""For me,"" she said at last, ""our political work has been a religion--it"
1047,"has been more than a religion."""
1047,""
1047,"I heard in silence. I had no form of protest available against the"
1047,"implications of that."
1047,""
1047,"""And then I find you turning against all we aimed to do--talking of"
1047,"going over, almost lightly--to those others.""..."
1047,""
1047,"She was white-lipped as she spoke. In the most curious way she had"
1047,"captured the moral values of the situation. I found myself protesting"
1047,"ineffectually against her fixed conviction. ""It's because I think my"
1047,"duty lies in this change that I make it,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""I don't see how you can say that,"" she replied quietly."
1047,""
1047,"There was another pause between us."
1047,""
1047,"""Oh!"" she said and clenched her hand upon the table. ""That it should"
1047,"have come to this!"""
1047,""
1047,"She was extraordinarily dignified and extraordinarily absurd. She was"
1047,"hurt and thwarted beyond measure. She had no place in her ideas, I"
1047,"thought, for me. I could see how it appeared to her, but I could not"
1047,"make her see anything of the intricate process that had brought me to"
1047,"this divergence. The opposition of our intellectual temperaments"
1047,"was like a gag in my mouth. What was there for me to say? A flash"
1047,"of intuition told me that behind her white dignity was a passionate"
1047,"disappointment, a shattering of dreams that needed before everything"
1047,"else the relief of weeping."
1047,""
1047,"""I've told you,"" I said awkwardly, ""as soon as I could."""
1047,""
1047,"There was another long silence. ""So that is how we stand,"" I said with"
1047,"an air of having things defined. I walked slowly to the door."
1047,""
1047,"She had risen and stood now staring in front of her."
1047,""
1047,"""Good-night,"" I said, making no movement towards our habitual kiss."
1047,""
1047,"""Good-night,"" she answered in a tragic note...."
1047,""
1047,"I closed the door softly. I remained for a moment or so on the big"
1047,"landing, hesitating between my bedroom and my study. As I did so I heard"
1047,"the soft rustle of her movement and the click of the key in her bedroom"
1047,"door. Then everything was still...."
1047,""
1047,"She hid her tears from me. Something gripped my heart at the thought."
1047,""
1047,"""Damnation!"" I said wincing. ""Why the devil can't people at least THINK"
1047,"in the same manner?"""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"And that insufficient colloquy was the beginning of a prolonged"
1047,"estrangement between us. It was characteristic of our relations that we"
1047,"never reopened the discussion. The thing had been in the air for some"
1047,"time; we had recognised it now; the widening breach between us was"
1047,"confessed. My own feelings were curiously divided. It is remarkable that"
1047,"my very real affection for Margaret only became evident to me with this"
1047,"quarrel. The changes of the heart are very subtle changes. I am quite"
1047,"unaware how or when my early romantic love for her purity and beauty"
1047,"and high-principled devotion evaporated from my life; but I do know that"
1047,"quite early in my parliamentary days there had come a vague, unconfessed"
1047,"resentment at the tie that seemed to hold me in servitude to her"
1047,"standards of private living and public act. I felt I was caught, and"
1047,"none the less so because it had been my own act to rivet on my shackles."
1047,"So long as I still held myself bound to her that resentment grew. Now,"
1047,"since I had broken my bonds and taken my line it withered again, and I"
1047,"could think of Margaret with a returning kindliness."
1047,""
1047,"But I still felt embarrassment with her. I felt myself dependent upon"
1047,"her for house room and food and social support, as it were under false"
1047,"pretences. I would have liked to have separated our financial affairs"
1047,"altogether. But I knew that to raise the issue would have seemed a"
1047,"last brutal indelicacy. So I tried almost furtively to keep my personal"
1047,"expenditure within the scope of the private income I made by writing,"
1047,"and we went out together in her motor brougham, dined and made"
1047,"appearances, met politely at breakfast--parted at night with a kiss upon"
1047,"her cheek. The locking of her door upon me, which at that time I quite"
1047,"understood, which I understand now, became for a time in my mind,"
1047,"through some obscure process of the soul, an offence. I never crossed"
1047,"the landing to her room again."
1047,""
1047,"In all this matter, and, indeed, in all my relations with Margaret, I"
1047,"perceive now I behaved badly and foolishly. My manifest blunder is that"
1047,"I, who was several years older than she, much subtler and in many ways"
1047,"wiser, never in any measure sought to guide and control her. After our"
1047,"marriage I treated her always as an equal, and let her go her way; held"
1047,"her responsible for all the weak and ineffective and unfortunate things"
1047,"she said and did to me. She wasn't clever enough to justify that. It"
1047,"wasn't fair to expect her to sympathise, anticipate, and understand."
1047,"I ought to have taken care of her, roped her to me when it came to"
1047,"crossing the difficult places. If I had loved her more, and wiselier and"
1047,"more tenderly, if there had not been the consciousness of my financial"
1047,"dependence on her always stiffening my pride, I think she would have"
1047,"moved with me from the outset, and left the Liberals with me. But she"
1047,"did not get any inkling of the ends I sought in my change of sides. It"
1047,"must have seemed to her inexplicable perversity. She had, I knew--for"
1047,"surely I knew it then--an immense capacity for loyalty and devotion."
1047,"There she was with these treasures untouched, neglected and perplexed."
1047,"A woman who loves wants to give. It is the duty and business of the man"
1047,"she has married for love to help her to help and give. But I was stupid."
1047,"My eyes had never been opened. I was stiff with her and difficult to"
1047,"her, because even on my wedding morning there had been, deep down in"
1047,"my soul, voiceless though present, something weakly protesting, a faint"
1047,"perception of wrong-doing, the infinitesimally small, slow-multiplying"
1047,"germs of shame."

1047,""
1047,""

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I made my breach with the party on the Budget."
1047,""
1047,"In many ways I was disposed to regard the 1909 Budget as a fine piece"
1047,"of statecraft. Its production was certainly a very unexpected display"
1047,"of vigour on the Liberal side. But, on the whole, this movement"
1047,"towards collectivist organisation on the part of the Liberals rather"
1047,"strengthened than weakened my resolve to cross the floor of the house."
1047,"It made it more necessary, I thought, to leaven the purely obstructive"
1047,"and reactionary elements that were at once manifest in the opposition. I"
1047,"assailed the land taxation proposals in one main speech, and a series"
1047,"of minor speeches in committee. The line of attack I chose was that the"
1047,"land was a great public service that needed to be controlled on broad"
1047,"and far-sighted lines. I had no objection to its nationalisation, but I"
1047,"did object most strenuously to the idea of leaving it in private hands,"
1047,"and attempting to produce beneficial social results through the pressure"
1047,"of taxation upon the land-owning class. That might break it up in an"
1047,"utterly disastrous way. The drift of the government proposals was all in"
1047,"the direction of sweating the landowner to get immediate values from his"
1047,"property, and such a course of action was bound to give us an irritated"
1047,"and vindictive land-owning class, the class upon which we had hitherto"
1047,"relied--not unjustifiably--for certain broad, patriotic services and"
1047,"an influence upon our collective judgments that no other class seemed"
1047,"prepared to exercise. Abolish landlordism if you will, I said, buy"
1047,"it out, but do not drive it to a defensive fight, and leave it still"
1047,"sufficiently strong and wealthy to become a malcontent element in your"
1047,"state. You have taxed and controlled the brewer and the publican until"
1047,"the outraged Liquor Interest has become a national danger. You now"
1047,"propose to do the same thing on a larger scale. You turn a class which"
1047,"has many fine and truly aristocratic traditions towards revolt, and"
1047,"there is nothing in these or any other of your proposals that shows any"
1047,"sense of the need for leadership to replace these traditional leaders"
1047,"you are ousting. This was the substance of my case, and I hammered at it"
1047,"not only in the House, but in the press...."
1047,""
1047,"The Kinghampstead division remained for some time insensitive to my"
1047,"defection."
1047,""
1047,"Then it woke up suddenly, and began, in the columns of the"
1047,"KINGSHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN, an indignant, confused outcry. I was treated to"
1047,"an open letter, signed ""Junius Secundus,"" and I replied in provocative"
1047,"terms. There were two thinly attended public meetings at different ends"
1047,"of the constituency, and then I had a correspondence with my old friend"
1047,"Parvill, the photographer, which ended in my seeing a deputation."
1047,""
1047,"My impression is that it consisted of about eighteen or twenty people."
1047,"They had had to come upstairs to me and they were manifestly full of"
1047,"indignation and a little short of breath. There was Parvill himself,"
1047,"J.P., dressed wholly in black--I think to mark his sense of the"
1047,"occasion--and curiously suggestive in his respect for my character and"
1047,"his concern for the honourableness of the KINGHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN editor,"
1047,"of Mark Antony at the funeral of Cesar. There was Mrs. Bulger, also in"
1047,"mourning; she had never abandoned the widow's streamers since the death"
1047,"of her husband ten years ago, and her loyalty to Liberalism of the"
1047,"severest type was part as it were of her weeds. There was a nephew of"
1047,"Sir Roderick Newton, a bright young Hebrew of the graver type, and a"
1047,"couple of dissenting ministers in high collars and hats that stopped"
1047,"halfway between the bowler of this world and the shovel-hat of heaven."
1047,"There was also a young solicitor from Lurky done in the horsey style,"
1047,"and there was a very little nervous man with a high brow and a face"
1047,"contracting below as though the jawbones and teeth had been taken out"
1047,"and the features compressed. The rest of the deputation, which included"
1047,"two other public-spirited ladies and several ministers of religion,"
1047,"might have been raked out of any omnibus going Strandward during the"
1047,"May meetings. They thrust Parvill forward as spokesman, and manifested"
1047,"a strong disposition to say ""Hear, hear!"" to his more strenuous protests"
1047,"provided my eye wasn't upon them at the time."
1047,""
1047,"I regarded this appalling deputation as Parvill's apologetic but quite"
1047,"definite utterances drew to an end. I had a moment of vision. Behind"
1047,"them I saw the wonderful array of skeleton forces that stand for public"
1047,"opinion, that are as much public opinion as exists indeed at the present"
1047,"time. The whole process of politics which bulks so solidly in history"
1047,"seemed for that clairvoyant instant but a froth of petty motives above"
1047,"abysms of indifference...."
1047,""
1047,"Some one had finished. I perceived I had to speak."
1047,""
1047,"""Very well,"" I said, ""I won't keep you long in replying. I'll resign if"
1047,"there isn't a dissolution before next February, and if there is I shan't"
1047,"stand again. You don't want the bother and expense of a bye-election"
1047,"(approving murmurs) if it can be avoided. But I may tell you plainly now"
1047,"that I don't think it will be necessary for me to resign, and the sooner"
1047,"you find my successor the better for the party. The Lords are in a"
1047,"corner; they've got to fight now or never, and I think they will throw"
1047,"out the Budget. Then they will go on fighting. It is a fight that will"
1047,"last for years. They have a sort of social discipline, and you haven't."
1047,"You Liberals will find yourselves with a country behind you, vaguely"
1047,"indignant perhaps, but totally unprepared with any ideas whatever in"
1047,"the matter, face to face with the problem of bringing the British"
1047,"constitution up-to-date. Anything may happen, provided only that it is"
1047,"sufficiently absurd. If the King backs the Lords--and I don't see why he"
1047,"shouldn't--you have no Republican movement whatever to fall back"
1047,"upon. You lost it during the Era of Good Taste. The country, I say, is"
1047,"destitute of ideas, and you have no ideas to give it. I don't see what"
1047,"you will do.... For my own part, I mean to spend a year or so between a"
1047,"window and my writing-desk."""
1047,""
1047,"I paused. ""I think, gentlemen,"" began Parvill, ""that we hear all this"
1047,"with very great regret...."""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"4"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"My estrangement from Margaret stands in my memory now as something that"
1047,"played itself out within the four walls of our house in Radnor Square,"
1047,"which was, indeed, confined to those limits. I went to and fro between"
1047,"my house and the House of Commons, and the dining-rooms and clubs and"
1047,"offices in which we were preparing our new developments, in a state"
1047,"of aggressive and energetic dissociation, in the nascent state, as a"
1047,"chemist would say. I was free now, and greedy for fresh combination. I"
1047,"had a tremendous sense of released energies. I had got back to the sort"
1047,"of thing I could do, and to the work that had been shaping itself for"
1047,"so long in my imagination. Our purpose now was plain, bold, and"
1047,"extraordinarily congenial. We meant no less than to organise a new"
1047,"movement in English thought and life, to resuscitate a Public Opinion"
1047,"and prepare the ground for a revised and renovated ruling culture."
1047,""
1047,"For a time I seemed quite wonderfully able to do whatever I wanted to"
1047,"do. Shoesmith responded to my first advances. We decided to create a"
1047,"weekly paper as our nucleus, and Crupp and I set to work forthwith to"
1047,"collect a group of writers and speakers, including Esmeer, Britten, Lord"
1047,"Gane, Neal, and one or two younger men, which should constitute a more"
1047,"or less definite editorial council about me, and meet at a weekly lunch"
1047,"on Tuesday to sustain our general co-operations. We marked our claim"
1047,"upon Toryism even in the colour of our wrapper, and spoke of ourselves"
1047,"collectively as the Blue Weeklies. But our lunches were open to all"
1047,"sorts of guests, and our deliberations were never of a character to"
1047,"control me effectively in my editorial decisions. My only influential"
1047,"councillor at first was old Britten, who became my sub-editor. It was"
1047,"curious how we two had picked up our ancient intimacy again and resumed"
1047,"the easy give and take of our speculative dreaming schoolboy days."
1047,""
1047,"For a time my life centred altogether upon this journalistic work."
1047,"Britten was an experienced journalist, and I had most of the necessary"
1047,"instincts for the business. We meant to make the paper right and"
1047,"good down to the smallest detail, and we set ourselves at this with"
1047,"extraordinary zeal. It wasn't our intention to show our political"
1047,"motives too markedly at first, and through all the dust storm and"
1047,"tumult and stress of the political struggle of 1910, we made a little"
1047,"intellectual oasis of good art criticism and good writing. It was the"
1047,"firm belief of nearly all of us that the Lords were destined to be"
1047,"beaten badly in 1910, and our game was the longer game of reconstruction"
1047,"that would begin when the shouting and tumult of that immediate conflict"
1047,"were over. Meanwhile we had to get into touch with just as many good"
1047,"minds as possible."
1047,""
1047,"As we felt our feet, I developed slowly and carefully a broadly"
1047,"conceived and consistent political attitude. As I will explain later,"
1047,"we were feminist from the outset, though that caused Shoesmith and Gane"
1047,"great searching of heart; we developed Esmeer's House of Lords reform"
1047,"scheme into a general cult of the aristocratic virtues, and we did much"
1047,"to humanise and liberalise the narrow excellencies of that Break-up of"
1047,"the Poor Law agitation, which had been organised originally by Beatrice"
1047,"and Sidney Webb. In addition, without any very definite explanation to"
1047,"any one but Esmeer and Isabel Rivers, and as if it was quite a small"
1047,"matter, I set myself to secure a uniform philosophical quality in our"
1047,"columns."
1047,""
1047,"That, indeed, was the peculiar virtue and characteristic of the BLUE"
1047,"WEEKLY. I was now very definitely convinced that much of the confusion"
1047,"and futility of contemporary thought was due to the general need of"
1047,"metaphysical training.... The great mass of people--and not simply"
1047,"common people, but people active and influential in intellectual"
1047,"things--are still quite untrained in the methods of thought and"
1047,"absolutely innocent of any criticism of method; it is scarcely a"
1047,"caricature to call their thinking a crazy patchwork, discontinuous and"
1047,"chaotic. They arrive at conclusions by a kind of accident, and do not"
1047,"suspect any other way may be found to their attainment. A stage above"
1047,"this general condition stands that minority of people who have at"
1047,"some time or other discovered general terms and a certain use"
1047,"for generalisations. They are--to fall back on the ancient"
1047,"technicality--Realists of a crude sort. When I say Realist of course"
1047,"I mean Realist as opposed to Nominalist, and not Realist in the almost"
1047,"diametrically different sense of opposition to Idealist. Such are the"
1047,"Baileys; such, to take their great prototype, was Herbert Spencer (who"
1047,"couldn't read Kant); such are whole regiments of prominent and entirely"
1047,"self-satisfied contemporaries. They go through queer little processes of"
1047,"definition and generalisation and deduction with the completest belief"
1047,"in the validity of the intellectual instrument they are using. They are"
1047,"Realists--Cocksurists--in matter of fact; sentimentalists in behaviour."
1047,"The Baileys having got to this glorious stage in mental development--it"

1047,"Both Isabel and I believe firmly that these differences of intellectual"
1047,"method matter profoundly in the affairs of mankind, that the collective"
1047,"mind of this intricate complex modern state can only function properly"
1047,"upon neo-Nominalist lines. This has always been her side of our mental"
1047,"co-operation rather than mine. Her mind has the light movement that"
1047,"goes so often with natural mental power; she has a wonderful art in"
1047,"illustration, and, as the reader probably knows already, she writes of"
1047,"metaphysical matters with a rare charm and vividness. So far there has"
1047,"been no collection of her papers published, but they are to be found not"
1047,"only in the BLUE WEEKLY columns but scattered about the monthlies; many"
1047,"people must be familiar with her style. It was an intention we did"
1047,"much to realise before our private downfall, that we would use the BLUE"
1047,"WEEKLY to maintain a stream of suggestion against crude thinking, and"
1047,"at last scarcely a week passed but some popular distinction, some"
1047,"large imposing generalisation, was touched to flaccidity by her pen or"

1047,"I was at great pains to give my philosophical, political, and social"
1047,"matter the best literary and critical backing we could get in London. I"
1047,"hunted sedulously for good descriptive writing and good criticism; I"
1047,"was indefatigable in my readiness to hear and consider, if not to accept"
1047,"advice; I watched every corner of the paper, and had a dozen men alert"
1047,"to get me special matter of the sort that draws in the unattached"
1047,"reader. The chief danger on the literary side of a weekly is that it"
1047,"should fall into the hands of some particular school, and this I watched"
1047,"for closely. It seems impossible to get vividness of apprehension and"
1047,"breadth of view together in the same critic. So it falls to the wise"
1047,"editor to secure the first and impose the second. Directly I detected"
1047,"the shrill partisan note in our criticism, the attempt to puff a poor"
1047,"thing because it was ""in the right direction,"" or damn a vigorous piece"
1047,"of work because it wasn't, I tackled the man and had it out with him."

1047,"all the clubs in London and three-quarters of the country houses where"
1047,"week-end parties gather together. Its sale by newsagents and bookstalls"

1047,"Cecil, the fine arches of Waterloo Bridge, and the long sweep of south"
1047,"bank with its shot towers and chimneys, past Bankside to the dimly seen"
1047,"piers of the great bridge below the Tower. The dome of St. Paul's just"

1047,"day, in every light and atmosphere, it was a beautiful and various view,"
1047,"alive as a throbbing heart; a perpetual flow of traffic ploughed and"
1047,"splashed the streaming silver of the river, and by night the shapes of"

1047,"Art is selection and so is most autobiography. But I am concerned with a"
1047,"more tangled business than selection, I want to show a contemporary man"
1047,"in relation to the state and social usage, and the social organism in"
1047,"relation to that man. To tell my story at all I have to simplify. I have"
1047,"given now the broad lines of my political development, and how I passed"
1047,"from my initial liberal-socialism to the conception of a constructive"
1047,"aristocracy. I have tried to set that out in the form of a man"
1047,"discovering himself. Incidentally that self-development led to a"
1047,"profound breach with my wife. One has read stories before of husband"
1047,"and wife speaking severally two different languages and coming to an"
1047,"understanding. But Margaret and I began in her dialect, and, as I came"
1047,"more and more to use my own, diverged."
1047,""
1047,"I had thought when I married that the matter of womankind had ended for"
1047,"me. I have tried to tell all that sex and women had been to me up to my"
1047,"married life with Margaret and our fatal entanglement, tried to show the"
1047,"queer, crippled, embarrassed and limited way in which these interests"
1047,"break upon the life of a young man under contemporary conditions. I"
1047,"do not think my lot was a very exceptional one. I missed the chance of"
1047,"sisters and girl playmates, but that is not an uncommon misadventure"
1047,"in an age of small families; I never came to know any woman at all"
1047,"intimately until I was married to Margaret. My earlier love affairs were"
1047,"encounters of sex, under conditions of furtiveness and adventure that"
1047,"made them things in themselves, restricted and unilluminating. From a"
1047,"boyish disposition to be mystical and worshipping towards women I"
1047,"had passed into a disregardful attitude, as though women were things"
1047,"inferior or irrelevant, disturbers in great affairs. For a time Margaret"
1047,"had blotted out all other women; she was so different and so near;"
1047,"she was like a person who stands suddenly in front of a little window"
1047,"through which one has been surveying a crowd. She didn't become"
1047,"womankind for me so much as eliminate womankind from my world.... And"
1047,"then came this secret separation...."
1047,""
1047,"Until this estrangement and the rapid and uncontrollable development of"
1047,"my relations with Isabel which chanced to follow it, I seemed to have"
1047,"solved the problem of women by marriage and disregard. I thought these"
1047,"things were over. I went about my career with Margaret beside me, her"
1047,"brow slightly knit, her manner faintly strenuous, helping, helping; and"
1047,"if we had not altogether abolished sex we had at least so circumscribed"
1047,"and isolated it that it would not have affected the general tenor of our"
1047,"lives in the slightest degree if we had."
1047,""
1047,"And then, clothing itself more and more in the form of Isabel and her"
1047,"problems, this old, this fundamental obsession of my life returned. The"
1047,"thing stole upon my mind so that I was unaware of its invasion and how"
1047,"it was changing our long intimacy. I have already compared the lot of"
1047,"the modern publicist to Machiavelli writing in his study; in his day"
1047,"women and sex were as disregarded in these high affairs as, let us say,"
1047,"the chemistry of air or the will of the beasts in the fields; in ours"
1047,"the case has altogether changed, and woman has come now to stand beside"
1047,"the tall candles, half in the light, half in the mystery of the"
1047,"shadows, besetting, interrupting, demanding unrelentingly an altogether"
1047,"unprecedented attention. I feel that in these matters my life has been"
1047,"almost typical of my time. Woman insists upon her presence. She is"
1047,"no longer a mere physical need, an aesthetic bye-play, a sentimental"
1047,"background; she is a moral and intellectual necessity in a man's life."
1047,"She comes to the politician and demands, Is she a child or a citizen? Is"
1047,"she a thing or a soul? She comes to the individual man, as she came"
1047,"to me and asks, Is she a cherished weakling or an equal mate, an"
1047,"unavoidable helper? Is she to be tried and trusted or guarded and"
1047,"controlled, bond or free? For if she is a mate, one must at once trust"
1047,"more and exact more, exacting toil, courage, and the hardest, most"
1047,"necessary thing of all, the clearest, most shameless, explicitness of"
1047,"understanding...."

1047,"In all my earlier imaginings of statecraft I had tacitly assumed either"
1047,"that the relations of the sexes were all right or that anyhow they"
1047,"didn't concern the state. It was a matter they, whoever ""they"" were, had"
1047,"to settle among themselves. That sort of disregard was possible then."
1047,"But even before 1906 there were endless intimations that the dams"
1047,"holding back great reservoirs of discussion were crumbling. We political"
1047,"schemers were ploughing wider than any one had ploughed before in the"
1047,"field of social reconstruction. We had also, we realised, to plough"
1047,"deeper. We had to plough down at last to the passionate elements of"
1047,"sexual relationship and examine and decide upon them."
1047,""
1047,"The signs multiplied. In a year or so half the police of the metropolis"
1047,"were scarce sufficient to protect the House from one clamorous aspect"
1047,"of the new problem. The members went about Westminster with an odd, new"
1047,"sense of being beset. A good proportion of us kept up the pretence that"
1047,"the Vote for Women was an isolated fad, and the agitation an epidemic"
1047,"madness that would presently pass. But it was manifest to any one who"
1047,"sought more than comfort in the matter that the streams of women and"
1047,"sympathisers and money forthcoming marked far deeper and wider things"
1047,"than an idle fancy for the franchise. The existing laws and conventions"
1047,"of relationship between Man and Woman were just as unsatisfactory a"
1047,"disorder as anything else in our tumbled confusion of a world, and that"
1047,"also was coming to bear upon statecraft."

1047,"My first parliament was the parliament of the Suffragettes. I don't"
1047,"propose to tell here of that amazing campaign, with its absurdities"
1047,"and follies, its courage and devotion. There were aspects of that"
1047,"unquenchable agitation that were absolutely heroic and aspects that were"
1047,"absolutely pitiful. It was unreasonable, unwise, and, except for its"
1047,"one central insistence, astonishingly incoherent. It was amazingly"
1047,"effective. The very incoherence of the demand witnessed, I think, to the"
1047,"forces that lay behind it. It wasn't a simple argument based on a"
1047,"simple assumption; it was the first crude expression of a great mass and"
1047,"mingling of convergent feelings, of a widespread, confused persuasion"
1047,"among modern educated women that the conditions of their relations with"
1047,"men were oppressive, ugly, dishonouring, and had to be altered. They"
1047,"had not merely adopted the Vote as a symbol of equality; it was fairly"
1047,"manifest to me that, given it, they meant to use it, and to use it"
1047,"perhaps even vindictively and blindly, as a weapon against many things"
1047,"they had every reason to hate...."
1047,""
1047,"I remember, with exceptional vividness, that great night early in the"
1047,"session of 1909, when--I think it was--fifty or sixty women went to"
1047,"prison. I had been dining at the Barham's, and Lord Barham and I came"
1047,"down from the direction of St. James's Park into a crowd and a confusion"
1047,"outside the Caxton Hall. We found ourselves drifting with an immense"
1047,"multitude towards Parliament Square and parallel with a silent,"
1047,"close-packed column of girls and women, for the most part white-faced"
1047,"and intent. I still remember the effect of their faces upon me. It was"
1047,"quite different from the general effect of staring about and divided"
1047,"attention one gets in a political procession of men. There was an"
1047,"expression of heroic tension."

1047,"There had been a pretty deliberate appeal on the part of the women's"
1047,"organisers to the Unemployed, who had been demonstrating throughout that"
1047,"winter, to join forces with the movement, and the result was shown"
1047,"in the quality of the crowd upon the pavement. It was an ugly,"
1047,"dangerous-looking crowd, but as yet good-tempered and sympathetic. When"
1047,"at last we got within sight of the House the square was a seething seat"
1047,"of excited people, and the array of police on horse and on foot might"
1047,"have been assembled for a revolutionary outbreak. There were dense"
1047,"masses of people up Whitehall, and right on to Westminster Bridge. The"

1047,"Later on in that year the women began a new attack. Day and night, and"
1047,"all through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the piers"
1047,"of the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch, stood women"
1047,"pickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we went to and"
1047,"fro. They were women of all sorts, though, of course, the independent"
1047,"worker-class predominated. There were grey-headed old ladies standing"
1047,"there, sturdily charming in the rain; battered-looking, ambiguous women,"
1047,"with something of the desperate bitterness of battered women showing in"
1047,"their eyes; north-country factory girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women;"
1047,"trim, comfortable mothers of families; valiant-eyed girl graduates"
1047,"and undergraduates; lank, hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's"
1047,"imagination; one very dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall,"
1047,"grave and steadfast, with eyes fixed on distant things. Some of those"
1047,"women looked defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of"
1047,"adventure, some drooping with cold and fatigue. The supply never ceased."
1047,"I had a mortal fear that somehow the supply might halt or cease. I"
1047,"found that continual siege of the legislature extraordinarily"
1047,"impressive--infinitely more impressive than the feeble-forcible"

1047,"scattered homes, rooms, colleges, to Westminster."

1047,"I remember too the petty little difficulty I felt whether I should"
1047,"ignore these pickets altogether, or lift a hat as I hurried past with"

1047,"struggled, all of us, to ignore the indicating finger it thrust out"
1047,"before us. ""Your schemes, for all their bigness,"" it insisted to"

1047,"works in every class to preserve in its essentials the habitual daily"
1047,"life is all against a profounder treatment of political issues. The"
1047,"politician, almost as absurdly as the philosopher, tends constantly, in"
1047,"spite of magnificent preludes, vast intimations, to specialise himself"
1047,"out of the reality he has so stupendously summoned--he bolts back to"
1047,"littleness. The world has to be moulded anew, he continues to admit, but"

1047,"The discussion of the relations of men and women disturbs every one. It"
1047,"reacts upon the private life of every one who attempts it. And at"
1047,"any particular time only a small minority have a personal interest in"
1047,"changing the established state of affairs. Habit and interest are in a"
1047,"constantly recruited majority against conscious change and adjustment"
1047,"in these matters. Drift rules us. The great mass of people, and an"
1047,"overwhelming proportion of influential people, are people who have"
1047,"banished their dreams and made their compromise. Wonderful and beautiful"
1047,"possibilities are no longer to be thought about. They have given up"
1047,"any aspirations for intense love, their splendid offspring, for keen"
1047,"delights, have accepted a cultivated kindliness and an uncritical sense"
1047,"of righteousness as their compensation. It's a settled affair with"
1047,"them, a settled, dangerous affair. Most of them fear, and many hate, the"
1047,"slightest reminder of those abandoned dreams. As Dayton once said to"
1047,"the Pentagram Circle, when we were discussing the problem of a universal"
1047,"marriage and divorce law throughout the Empire, ""I am for leaving all"
1047,"these things alone."" And then, with a groan in his voice, ""Leave them"
1047,"alone! Leave them all alone!"""

1047,"That was his whole speech for the evening, in a note of suppressed"
1047,"passion, and presently, against all our etiquette, he got up and went"

1047,"For some years after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone. I"
1047,"developed a dread and dislike for romance, for emotional music, for the"
1047,"human figure in art--turning my heart to landscape. I wanted to sneer"
1047,"at lovers and their ecstasies, and was uncomfortable until I found"
1047,"the effective sneer. In matters of private morals these were my most"
1047,"uncharitable years. I didn't want to think of these things any more for"
1047,"ever. I hated the people whose talk or practice showed they were not"
1047,"of my opinion. I wanted to believe that their views were immoral and"
1047,"objectionable and contemptible, because I had decided to treat them as"
1047,"at that level. I was, in fact, falling into the attitude of the normal"
1047,"decent man."

1047,"And yet one cannot help thinking! The sensible moralised man finds it"
1047,"hard to escape the stream of suggestion that there are still dreams"

1047,"intimate things my fast friendship with Isabel was bringing about, that"
1047,"led me to the heretical views I have in the last five years dragged from"
1047,"the region of academic and timid discussion into the field of practical"
1047,"politics. Those influences, no doubt, have converged to the same end,"
1047,"and given me a powerful emotional push upon my road, but it was a"
1047,"broader and colder view of things that first determined me in my attempt"
1047,"to graft the Endowment of Motherhood in some form or other upon British"
1047,"Imperialism. Now that I am exiled from the political world, it is"
1047,"possible to estimate just how effectually that grafting has been done."
1047,""
1047,"I have explained how the ideas of a trained aristocracy and a universal"
1047,"education grew to paramount importance in my political scheme. It is but"
1047,"a short step from this to the question of the quantity and quality of"
1047,"births in the community, and from that again to these forbidden and"
1047,"fear-beset topics of marriage, divorce, and the family organisation."
1047,"A sporadic discussion of these aspects had been going on for years, a"
1047,"Eugenic society existed, and articles on the Falling Birth Rate, and the"
1047,"Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit were staples of the monthly magazines."
1047,"But beyond an intermittent scolding of prosperous childless people"
1047,"in general--one never addressed them in particular--nothing was done"
1047,"towards arresting those adverse processes. Almost against my natural"
1047,"inclination, I found myself forced to go into these things. I came to"
1047,"the conclusion that under modern conditions the isolated private family,"
1047,"based on the existing marriage contract, was failing in its work. It"
1047,"wasn't producing enough children, and children good enough and well"
1047,"trained enough for the demands of the developing civilised state."
1047,"Our civilisation was growing outwardly, and decaying in its intimate"
1047,"substance, and unless it was presently to collapse, some very extensive"
1047,"and courageous reorganisation was needed. The old haphazard system"
1047,"of pairing, qualified more and more by worldly discretions, no longer"
1047,"secures a young population numerous enough or good enough for the"
1047,"growing needs and possibilities of our Empire. Statecraft sits weaving"
1047,"splendid garments, no doubt, but with a puny, ugly, insufficient baby in"
1047,"the cradle."
1047,""
1047,"No one so far has dared to take up this problem as a present question"
1047,"for statecraft, but it comes unheralded, unadvocated, and sits at"
1047,"every legislative board. Every improvement is provisional except the"
1047,"improvement of the race, and it became more and more doubtful to me if"
1047,"we were improving the race at all! Splendid and beautiful and courageous"
1047,"people must come together and have children, women with their fine"
1047,"senses and glorious devotion must be freed from the net that compels"
1047,"them to be celibate, compels them to be childless and useless, or to"
1047,"bear children ignobly to men whom need and ignorance and the treacherous"
1047,"pressure of circumstances have forced upon them. We all know that,"
1047,"and so few dare even to whisper it for fear that they should seem, in"
1047,"seeking to save the family, to threaten its existence. It is as if"
1047,"a party of pigmies in a not too capacious room had been joined by a"
1047,"carnivorous giant--and decided to go on living happily by cutting him"
1047,"dead...."
1047,""
1047,"The problem the developing civilised state has to solve is how it can"
1047,"get the best possible increase under the best possible conditions."
1047,"I became more and more convinced that the independent family unit"
1047,"of to-day, in which the man is master of the wife and owner of the"
1047,"children, in which all are dependent upon him, subordinated to his"
1047,"enterprises and liable to follow his fortunes up or down, does not"
1047,"supply anything like the best conceivable conditions. We want to"
1047,"modernise the family footing altogether. An enormous premium both in"
1047,"pleasure and competitive efficiency is put upon voluntary childlessness,"
1047,"and enormous inducements are held out to women to subordinate"
1047,"instinctive and selective preferences to social and material"
1047,"considerations."
1047,""
1047,"The practical reaction of modern conditions upon the old tradition of"
1047,"the family is this: that beneath the pretence that nothing is changing,"
1047,"secretly and with all the unwholesomeness of secrecy everything is"
1047,"changed. Offspring fall away, the birth rate falls and falls most among"
1047,"just the most efficient and active and best adapted classes in the"
1047,"community. The species is recruited from among its failures and from"
1047,"among less civilised aliens. Contemporary civilisations are in effect"
1047,"burning the best of their possible babies in the furnaces that run the"
1047,"machinery. In the United States the native Anglo-American strain has"
1047,"scarcely increased at all since 1830, and in most Western European"
1047,"countries the same is probably true of the ablest and most energetic"
1047,"elements in the community. The women of these classes still remain"
1047,"legally and practically dependent and protected, with the only natural"
1047,"excuse for their dependence gone...."
1047,""
1047,"The modern world becomes an immense spectacle of unsatisfactory"
1047,"groupings; here childless couples bored to death in the hopeless effort"
1047,"to sustain an incessant honeymoon, here homes in which a solitary child"
1047,"grows unsocially, here small two or three-child homes that do no more"
1047,"than continue the culture of the parents at a great social cost, here"
1047,"numbers of unhappy educated but childless married women, here careless,"
1047,"decivilised fecund homes, here orphanages and asylums for the heedlessly"
1047,"begotten. It is just the disorderly proliferation of Bromstead over"
1047,"again, in lives instead of in houses."

1047,"What is the good, what is the common sense, of rectifying boundaries,"
1047,"pushing research and discovery, building cities, improving all the"
1047,"facilities of life, making great fleets, waging wars, while this aimless"
1047,"decadence remains the quality of the biological outlook?..."
1047,""
1047,"It is difficult now to trace how I changed from my early aversion until"
1047,"I faced this mass of problems. But so far back as 1910 I had it clear"
1047,"in my mind that I would rather fail utterly than participate in all the"
1047,"surrenders of mind and body that are implied in Dayton's snarl of ""Leave"
1047,"it alone; leave it all alone!"" Marriage and the begetting and care of"
1047,"children, is the very ground substance in the life of the community."
1047,"In a world in which everything changes, in which fresh methods, fresh"
1047,"adjustments and fresh ideas perpetually renew the circumstances of life,"
1047,"it is preposterous that we should not even examine into these matters,"
1047,"should rest content to be ruled by the uncriticised traditions of a"
1047,"barbaric age."
1047,""
1047,"Now, it seems to me that the solution of this problem is also the"
1047,"solution of the woman's individual problem. The two go together, are"
1047,"right and left of one question. The only conceivable way out from our"
1047,"IMPASSE lies in the recognition of parentage, that is to say of adequate"
1047,"mothering, as no longer a chance product of individual passions but"
1047,"a service rendered to the State. Women must become less and less"
1047,"subordinated to individual men, since this works out in a more or less"
1047,"complete limitation, waste, and sterilisation of their essentially"
1047,"social function; they must become more and more subordinated as"
1047,"individually independent citizens to the collective purpose. Or, to"
1047,"express the thing by a familiar phrase, the highly organised, scientific"
1047,"state we desire must, if it is to exist at all, base itself not upon"
1047,"the irresponsible man-ruled family, but upon the matriarchal family,"
1047,"the citizen-ship and freedom of women and the public endowment of"
1047,"motherhood."
1047,""
1047,"After two generations of confused and experimental revolt it grows clear"
1047,"to modern women that a conscious, deliberate motherhood and mothering is"
1047,"their special function in the State, and that a personal subordination"
1047,"to an individual man with an unlimited power of control over this"
1047,"intimate and supreme duty is a degradation. No contemporary woman of"
1047,"education put to the test is willing to recognise any claim a man can"
1047,"make upon her but the claim of her freely-given devotion to him. She"
1047,"wants the reality of her choice and she means ""family"" while a man"
1047,"too often means only possession. This alters the spirit of the family"
1047,"relationships fundamentally. Their form remains just what it was"
1047,"when woman was esteemed a pretty, desirable, and incidentally a"
1047,"child-producing, chattel. Against these time-honoured ideas the new"
1047,"spirit of womanhood struggles in shame, astonishment, bitterness, and"
1047,"tears...."
1047,""
1047,"I confess myself altogether feminist. I have no doubts in the matter."
1047,"I want this coddling and browbeating of women to cease. I want to"
1047,"see women come in, free and fearless, to a full participation in the"
1047,"collective purpose of mankind. Women, I am convinced, are as fine"
1047,"as men; they can be as wise as men; they are capable of far greater"
1047,"devotion than men. I want to see them citizens, with a marriage law"
1047,"framed primarily for them and for their protection and the good of the"
1047,"race, and not for men's satisfactions. I want to see them bearing and"
1047,"rearing good children in the State as a generously rewarded public duty"
1047,"and service, choosing their husbands freely and discerningly, and in no"
1047,"way enslaved by or subordinated to the men they have chosen. The social"
1047,"consciousness of women seems to me an unworked, an almost untouched mine"
1047,"of wealth for the constructive purpose of the world. I want to change"
1047,"the respective values of the family group altogether, and make the home"
1047,"indeed the women's kingdom and the mother the owner and responsible"
1047,"guardian of her children."
1047,""
1047,"It is no use pretending that this is not novel and revolutionary; it is."
1047,"The Endowment of Motherhood implies a new method of social organization,"
1047,"a rearrangement of the social unit, untried in human experience--as"
1047,"untried as electric traction was or flying in 1800. Of course, it may"
1047,"work out to modify men's ideas of marriage profoundly. To me that is"
1047,"a secondary consideration. I do not believe that particular assertion"
1047,"myself, because I am convinced that a practical monogamy is a"
1047,"psychological necessity to the mass of civilised people. But even if I"
1047,"did believe it I should still keep to my present line, because it is the"
1047,"only line that will prevent a highly organised civilisation from ending"
1047,"in biological decay. The public Endowment of Motherhood is the only"
1047,"possible way which will ensure the permanently developing civilised"
1047,"state at which all constructive minds are aiming. A point is reached in"
1047,"the life-history of a civilisation when either this reconstruction"
1047,"must be effected or the quality and MORALE of the population prove"
1047,"insufficient for the needs of the developing organisation. It is not so"
1047,"much moral decadence that will destroy us as moral inadaptability."
1047,"The old code fails under the new needs. The only alternative to this"
1047,"profound reconstruction is a decay in human quality and social collapse."
1047,"Either this unprecedented rearrangement must be achieved by our"
1047,"civilisation, or it must presently come upon a phase of disorder and"
1047,"crumble and perish, as Rome perished, as France declines, as the strain"
1047,"of the Pilgrim Fathers dwindles out of America. Whatever hope there may"
1047,"be in the attempt therefore, there is no alternative to the attempt."

1047,"didn't look scared at the mention of ""The Family,"" but if raising these"
1047,"issues were essential to the social reconstructions on which my life"

1047,"The question of whether I should commit myself to some open project in"
1047,"this direction was going on in my mind concurrently with my speculations"
1047,"about a change of party, like bass and treble in a complex piece of"
1047,"music. The two drew to a conclusion together. I would not only go over"
1047,"to Imperialism, but I would attempt to biologise Imperialism."
1047,""
1047,"I thought at first that I was undertaking a monstrous uphill task."
1047,"But as I came to look into the possibilities of the matter, a strong"
1047,"persuasion grew up in my mind that this panic fear of legislative"
1047,"proposals affecting the family basis was excessive, that things were"
1047,"much riper for development in this direction than old-experienced people"
1047,"out of touch with the younger generation imagined, that to phrase"
1047,"the thing in a parliamentary fashion, ""something might be done in the"
1047,"constituencies"" with the Endowment of Motherhood forthwith, provided"
1047,"only that it was made perfectly clear that anything a sane person could"
1047,"possibly intend by ""morality"" was left untouched by these proposals."

1047,"I went to work very carefully. I got Roper of the DAILY TELEPHONE and"
1047,"Burkett of the DIAL to try over a silly-season discussion of State Help"
1047,"for Mothers, and I put a series of articles on eugenics, upon the fall"
1047,"in the birth-rate, and similar topics in the BLUE WEEKLY, leading up"
1047,"to a tentative and generalised advocacy of the public endowment of the"
1047,"nation's children. I was more and more struck by the acceptance won by a"
1047,"sober and restrained presentation of this suggestion."
1047,""
1047,"And then, in the fourth year of the BLUE WEEKLY'S career, came the"
1047,"Handitch election, and I was forced by the clamour of my antagonist,"
1047,"and very willingly forced, to put my convictions to the test. I returned"
1047,"triumphantly to Westminster with the Public Endowment of Motherhood"
1047,"as part of my open profession and with the full approval of the party"
1047,"press. Applauding benches of Imperialists cheered me on my way to the"

1047,"individual lives. That is the collective human reality, the basis of"

1047,"I come to the most evasive and difficult part of my story, which is to"
1047,"tell how Isabel and I have made a common wreck of our joint lives."
1047,""
1047,"It is not the telling of one simple disastrous accident. There was a"
1047,"vein in our natures that led to this collapse, gradually and at"
1047,"this point and that it crept to the surface. One may indeed see our"
1047,"destruction--for indeed politically we could not be more extinct if we"
1047,"had been shot dead--in the form of a catastrophe as disconnected and"
1047,"conclusive as a meteoric stone falling out of heaven upon two friends"
1047,"and crushing them both. But I do not think that is true to our situation"
1047,"or ourselves. We were not taken by surprise. The thing was in us and"
1047,"not from without, it was akin to our way of thinking and our habitual"
1047,"attitudes; it had, for all its impulsive effect, a certain necessity. We"
1047,"might have escaped no doubt, as two men at a hundred yards may shoot at"
1047,"each other with pistols for a considerable time and escape. But it isn't"
1047,"particularly reasonable to talk of the contrariety of fate if they both"
1047,"get hit."
1047,""
1047,"Isabel and I were dangerous to each other for several years of"
1047,"friendship, and not quite unwittingly so."
1047,""
1047,"In writing this, moreover, there is a very great difficulty in steering"
1047,"my way between two equally undesirable tones in the telling. In the"
1047,"first place I do not want to seem to confess my sins with a penitence I"
1047,"am very doubtful if I feel. Now that I have got Isabel we can no doubt"
1047,"count the cost of it and feel unquenchable regrets, but I am not sure"
1047,"whether, if we could be put back now into such circumstances as we"
1047,"were in a year ago, or two years ago, whether with my eyes fully open I"
1047,"should not do over again very much as I did. And on the other hand I do"
1047,"not want to justify the things we have done. We are two bad people--if"
1047,"there is to be any classification of good and bad at all, we have acted"
1047,"badly, and quite apart from any other considerations we've largely"
1047,"wasted our own very great possibilities. But it is part of a queer"
1047,"humour that underlies all this, that I find myself slipping again and"
1047,"again into a sentimental treatment of our case that is as unpremeditated"
1047,"as it is insincere. When I am a little tired after a morning's writing"
1047,"I find the faint suggestion getting into every other sentence that our"
1047,"blunders and misdeeds embodied, after the fashion of the prophet Hosea,"
1047,"profound moral truths. Indeed, I feel so little confidence in my ability"
1047,"to keep this altogether out of my book that I warn the reader here that"
1047,"in spite of anything he may read elsewhere in the story, intimating"
1047,"however shyly an esoteric and exalted virtue in our proceedings, the"
1047,"plain truth of this business is that Isabel and I wanted each other with"
1047,"a want entirely formless, inconsiderate, and overwhelming. And though I"
1047,"could tell you countless delightful and beautiful things about Isabel,"
1047,"were this a book in her praise, I cannot either analyse that want or"
1047,"account for its extreme intensity."
1047,""
1047,"I will confess that deep in my mind there is a belief in a sort of wild"
1047,"rightness about any love that is fraught with beauty, but that eludes"
1047,"me and vanishes again, and is not, I feel, to be put with the real"
1047,"veracities and righteousnesses and virtues in the paddocks and"
1047,"menageries of human reason...."
1047,""
1047,"We have already a child, and Margaret was childless, and I find myself"
1047,"prone to insist upon that, as if it was a justification. But, indeed,"
1047,"when we became lovers there was small thought of Eugenics between us."
1047,"Ours was a mutual and not a philoprogenitive passion. Old Nature behind"
1047,"us may have had such purposes with us, but it is not for us to annex"
1047,"her intentions by a moralising afterthought. There isn't, in fact, any"
1047,"decent justification for us whatever--at that the story must stand."
1047,""
1047,"But if there is no justification there is at least a very effective"
1047,"excuse in the mental confusedness of our time. The evasion of that"
1047,"passionately thorough exposition of belief and of the grounds of"
1047,"morality, which is the outcome of the mercenary religious compromises of"
1047,"the late Vatican period, the stupid suppression of anything but the most"
1047,"timid discussion of sexual morality in our literature and drama, the"
1047,"pervading cultivated and protected muddle-headedness, leaves mentally"
1047,"vigorous people with relatively enormous possibilities of destruction"
1047,"and little effective help. They find themselves confronted by the"
1047,"habits and prejudices of manifestly commonplace people, and by that"
1047,"extraordinary patched-up Christianity, the cult of a ""Bromsteadised"""
1047,"deity, diffused, scattered, and aimless, which hides from examination"
1047,"and any possibility of faith behind the plea of good taste. A god about"
1047,"whom there is delicacy is far worse than no god at all. We are FORCED to"
1047,"be laws unto ourselves and to live experimentally. It is inevitable that"
1047,"a considerable fraction of just that bolder, more initiatory section of"
1047,"the intellectual community, the section that can least be spared from"
1047,"the collective life in a period of trial and change, will drift into"
1047,"such emotional crises and such disaster as overtook us. Most perhaps"
1047,"will escape, but many will go down, many more than the world can spare."
1047,"It is the unwritten law of all our public life, and the same holds true"
1047,"of America, that an honest open scandal ends a career. England in the"
1047,"last quarter of a century has wasted half a dozen statesmen on this"
1047,"score; she would, I believe, reject Nelson now if he sought to serve"
1047,"her. Is it wonderful that to us fretting here in exile this should seem"
1047,"the cruellest as well as the most foolish elimination of a necessary"
1047,"social element? It destroys no vice; for vice hides by nature. It"
1047,"not only rewards dullness as if it were positive virtue, but sets an"
1047,"enormous premium upon hypocrisy. That is my case, and that is why I am"

1047,"Ever since the Kinghamstead election I had maintained what seemed a"
1047,"desultory friendship with Isabel. At first it was rather Isabel kept"
1047,"it up than I. Whenever Margaret and I went down to that villa, with its"
1047,"three or four acres of garden and shrubbery about it, which fulfilled"
1047,"our election promise to live at Kinghamstead, Isabel would turn up in"
1047,"a state of frank cheerfulness, rejoicing at us, and talk all she was"
1047,"reading and thinking to me, and stay for all the rest of the day. In"
1047,"her shameless liking for me she was as natural as a savage. She would"
1047,"exercise me vigorously at tennis, while Margaret lay and rested her"
1047,"back in the afternoon, or guide me for some long ramble that dodged the"
1047,"suburban and congested patches of the constituency with amazing skill."
1047,"She took possession of me in that unabashed, straight-minded way a girl"
1047,"will sometimes adopt with a man, chose my path or criticised my"
1047,"game with a motherly solicitude for my welfare that was absurd and"
1047,"delightful. And we talked. We discussed and criticised the stories of"
1047,"novels, scraps of history, pictures, social questions, socialism, the"
1047,"policy of the Government. She was young and most unevenly informed, but"
1047,"she was amazingly sharp and quick and good. Never before in my life had"
1047,"I known a girl of her age, or a woman of her quality. I had never dreamt"
1047,"there was such talk in the world. Kinghamstead became a lightless"
1047,"place when she went to Oxford. Heaven knows how much that may not have"
1047,"precipitated my abandonment of the seat!"
1047,""
1047,"She went to Ridout College, Oxford, and that certainly weighed with"
1047,"me when presently after my breach with the Liberals various little"
1047,"undergraduate societies began to ask for lectures and discussions. I"
1047,"favoured Oxford. I declared openly I did so because of her. At that time"
1047,"I think we neither of us suspected the possibility of passion that lay"
1047,"like a coiled snake in the path before us. It seemed to us that we"
1047,"had the quaintest, most delightful friendship in the world; she was"
1047,"my pupil, and I was her guide, philosopher, and friend. People smiled"
1047,"indulgently--even Margaret smiled indulgently--at our attraction for one"
1047,"another."
1047,""
1047,"Such friendships are not uncommon nowadays--among easy-going,"
1047,"liberal-minded people. For the most part, there's no sort of harm, as"
1047,"people say, in them. The two persons concerned are never supposed to"
1047,"think of the passionate love that hovers so close to the friendship, or"
1047,"if they do, then they banish the thought. I think we kept the thought as"
1047,"permanently in exile as any one could do. If it did in odd moments come"
1047,"into our heads we pretended elaborately it wasn't there."

1047,"I remember once during the Oxford days an intimation that should have"
1047,"set me thinking, and I suppose discreetly disentangling myself. It was"
1047,"one Sunday afternoon, and it must have been about May, for the trees and"
1047,"shrubs of Ridout College were gay with blossom, and fresh with the new"
1047,"sharp greens of spring. I had walked talking with Isabel and a couple of"
1047,"other girls through the wide gardens of the place, seen and criticised"
1047,"the new brick pond, nodded to the daughter of this friend and that"
1047,"in the hammocks under the trees, and picked a way among the scattered"
1047,"tea-parties on the lawn to our own circle on the grass under a Siberian"
1047,"crab near the great bay window. There I sat and ate great quantities"
1047,"of cake, and discussed the tactics of the Suffragettes. I had made some"
1047,"comments upon the spirit of the movement in an address to the men in"
1047,"Pembroke, and it had got abroad, and a group of girls and women dons"
1047,"were now having it out with me."

1047,"I forget the drift of the conversation, or what it was made Isabel"
1047,"interrupt me. She did interrupt me. She had been lying prone on the"
1047,"ground at my right hand, chin on fists, listening thoughtfully, and"
1047,"I was sitting beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat. I turned to"
1047,"Isabel's voice, and saw her face uplifted, and her dear cheeks and nose"
1047,"and forehead all splashed and barred with sunlight and the shadows of"
1047,"the twigs of the trees behind me. And something--an infinite tenderness,"
1047,"stabbed me. It was a keen physical feeling, like nothing I had ever felt"
1047,"before. It had a quality of tears in it. For the first time in my narrow"
1047,"and concentrated life another human being had really thrust into my"
1047,"being and gripped my very heart."

1047,"Our eyes met perplexed for an extraordinary moment. Then I turned"
1047,"back and addressed myself a little stiffly to the substance of her"
1047,"intervention. For some time I couldn't look at her again."
1047,""
1047,"From that time forth I knew I loved Isabel beyond measure."
1047,""
1047,"Yet it is curious that it never occurred to me for a year or so that"
1047,"this was likely to be a matter of passion between us. I have told how"
1047,"definitely I put my imagination into harness in those matters at my"
1047,"marriage, and I was living now in a world of big interests, where there"
1047,"is neither much time nor inclination for deliberate love-making. I"
1047,"suppose there is a large class of men who never meet a girl or a woman"
1047,"without thinking of sex, who meet a friend's daughter and decide:"
1047,"""Mustn't get friendly with her--wouldn't DO,"" and set invisible bars"
1047,"between themselves and all the wives in the world. Perhaps that is"
1047,"the way to live. Perhaps there is no other method than this effectual"
1047,"annihilation of half--and the most sympathetic and attractive half--of"
1047,"the human beings in the world, so far as any frank intercourse is"
1047,"concerned. I am quite convinced anyhow that such a qualified intimacy"
1047,"as ours, such a drifting into the sense of possession, such untrammeled"
1047,"conversation with an invisible, implacable limit set just where the"
1047,"intimacy glows, it is no kind of tolerable compromise. If men and women"
1047,"are to go so far together, they must be free to go as far as they may"
1047,"want to go, without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us."
1047,"On the basis of the accepted codes the jealous people are right, and the"
1047,"liberal-minded ones are playing with fire. If people are not to love,"
1047,"then they must be kept apart. If they are not to be kept apart, then we"
1047,"must prepare for an unprecedented toleration of lovers."
1047,""
1047,"Isabel was as unforeseeing as I to begin with, but sex marches into the"
1047,"life of an intelligent girl with demands and challenges far more urgent"
1047,"than the mere call of curiosity and satiable desire that comes to a"
1047,"young man. No woman yet has dared to tell the story of that unfolding."
1047,"She attracted men, and she encouraged them, and watched them, and tested"
1047,"them, and dismissed them, and concealed the substance of her thoughts"
1047,"about them in the way that seems instinctive in a natural-minded girl."
1047,"There was even an engagement--amidst the protests and disapproval of"
1047,"the college authorities. I never saw the man, though she gave me a long"
1047,"history of the affair, to which I listened with a forced and insincere"
1047,"sympathy. She struck me oddly as taking the relationship for a thing"
1047,"in itself, and regardless of its consequences. After a time she became"
1047,"silent about him, and then threw him over; and by that time, I think,"
1047,"for all that she was so much my junior, she knew more about herself and"
1047,"me than I was to know for several years to come."
1047,""
1047,"We didn't see each other for some months after my resignation, but we"
1047,"kept up a frequent correspondence. She said twice over that she wanted"
1047,"to talk to me, that letters didn't convey what one wanted to say, and"
1047,"I went up to Oxford pretty definitely to see her--though I combined it"
1047,"with one or two other engagements--somewhere in February. Insensibly she"
1047,"had become important enough for me to make journeys for her."
1047,""
1047,"But we didn't see very much of one another on that occasion. There was"
1047,"something in the air between us that made a faint embarrassment; the"
1047,"mere fact, perhaps, that she had asked me to come up."
1047,""
1047,"A year before she would have dashed off with me quite unscrupulously"
1047,"to talk alone, carried me off to her room for an hour with a minute of"
1047,"chaperonage to satisfy the rules. Now there was always some one or other"
1047,"near us that it seemed impossible to exorcise."
1047,""
1047,"We went for a walk on the Sunday afternoon with old Fortescue, K. C.,"
1047,"who'd come up to see his two daughters, both great friends of Isabel's,"
1047,"and some mute inglorious don whose name I forget, but who was in a"
1047,"state of marked admiration for her. The six of us played a game of"
1047,"conversational entanglements throughout, and mostly I was impressing"
1047,"the Fortescue girls with the want of mental concentration possible in a"
1047,"rising politician. We went down Carfex, I remember, to Folly Bridge,"
1047,"and inspected the Barges, and then back by way of Merton to the Botanic"
1047,"Gardens and Magdalen Bridge. And in the Botanic Gardens she got almost"
1047,"her only chance with me."
1047,""
1047,"""Last months at Oxford,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"""And then?"" I asked."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm coming to London,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"""To write?"""
1047,""
1047,"She was silent for a moment. Then she said abruptly, with that quick"
1047,"flush of hers and a sudden boldness in her eyes: ""I'm going to work with"
1047,"you. Why shouldn't I?"""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"3"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"Here, again, I suppose I had a fair warning of the drift of things."
1047,"I seem to remember myself in the train to Paddington, sitting with a"
1047,"handful of papers--galley proofs for the BLUE WEEKLY, I suppose--on my"
1047,"lap, and thinking about her and that last sentence of hers, and all that"
1047,"it might mean to me."
1047,""
1047,"It is very hard to recall even the main outline of anything so elusive"
1047,"as a meditation. I know that the idea of working with her gripped me,"
1047,"fascinated me. That my value in her life seemed growing filled me with"
1047,"pride and a kind of gratitude. I was already in no doubt that her value"
1047,"in my life was tremendous. It made it none the less, that in those days"
1047,"I was obsessed by the idea that she was transitory, and bound to go out"
1047,"of my life again. It is no good trying to set too fine a face upon this"
1047,"complex business, there is gold and clay and sunlight and savagery in"
1047,"every love story, and a multitude of elvish elements peeped out beneath"
1047,"the fine rich curtain of affection that masked our future. I've never"
1047,"properly weighed how immensely my vanity was gratified by her clear"
1047,"preference for me. Nor can I for a moment determine how much deliberate"
1047,"intention I hide from myself in this affair."
1047,""
1047,"Certainly I think some part of me must have been saying in the train:"
1047,"""Leave go of her. Get away from her. End this now."" I can't have been so"
1047,"stupid as not to have had that in my mind...."
1047,""
1047,"If she had been only a beautiful girl in love with me, I think I could"
1047,"have managed the situation. Once or twice since my marriage and before"
1047,"Isabel became of any significance in my life, there had been incidents"
1047,"with other people, flashes of temptation--no telling is possible of"
1047,"the thing resisted. I think that mere beauty and passion would not"
1047,"have taken me. But between myself and Isabel things were incurably"
1047,"complicated by the intellectual sympathy we had, the jolly march of"
1047,"our minds together. That has always mattered enormously. I should have"
1047,"wanted her company nearly as badly if she had been some crippled old"
1047,"lady; we would have hunted shoulder to shoulder, as two men. Only two"
1047,"men would never have had the patience and readiness for one another"
1047,"we two had. I had never for years met any one with whom I could be so"
1047,"carelessly sure of understanding or to whom I could listen so easily"
1047,"and fully. She gave me, with an extraordinary completeness, that rare,"
1047,"precious effect of always saying something fresh, and yet saying it so"
1047,"that it filled into and folded about all the little recesses and corners"
1047,"of my mind with an infinite, soft familiarity. It is impossible to"
1047,"explain that. It is like trying to explain why her voice, her voice"
1047,"heard speaking to any one--heard speaking in another room--pleased my"
1047,"ears."
1047,""
1047,"She was the only Oxford woman who took a first that year. She spent the"
1047,"summer in Scotland and Yorkshire, writing to me continually of all she"
1047,"now meant to do, and stirring my imagination. She came to London for"
1047,"the autumn session. For a time she stayed with old Lady Colbeck, but she"
1047,"fell out with her hostess when it became clear she wanted to write, not"
1047,"novels, but journalism, and then she set every one talking by taking"
1047,"a flat near Victoria and installing as her sole protector an elderly"
1047,"German governess she had engaged through a scholastic agency. She began"
1047,"writing, not in that copious flood the undisciplined young woman of"
1047,"gifts is apt to produce, but in exactly the manner of an able young man,"
1047,"experimenting with forms, developing the phrasing of opinions, taking"
1047,"a definite line. She was, of course, tremendously discussed. She was"
1047,"disapproved of, but she was invited out to dinner. She got rather a"
1047,"reputation for the management of elderly distinguished men. It was an"
1047,"odd experience to follow Margaret's soft rustle of silk into some"
1047,"big drawing-room and discover my snub-nosed girl in the blue sack"
1047,"transformed into a shining creature in the soft splendour of pearls and"
1047,"ivory-white and lace, and with a silver band about her dusky hair."
1047,""
1047,"For a time we did not meet very frequently, though always she professed"
1047,"an unblushing preference for my company, and talked my views and sought"
1047,"me out. Then her usefulness upon the BLUE WEEKLY began to link us"
1047,"closelier. She would come up to the office, and sit by the window,"
1047,"and talk over the proofs of the next week's articles, going through my"
1047,"intentions with a keen investigatory scalpel. Her talk always puts me in"
1047,"mind of a steel blade. Her writing became rapidly very good; she had"
1047,"a wit and a turn of the phrase that was all her own. We seemed to have"
1047,"forgotten the little shadow of embarrassment that had fallen over our"
1047,"last meeting at Oxford. Everything seemed natural and easy between us in"
1047,"those days; a little unconventional, but that made it all the brighter."
1047,""
1047,"We developed something like a custom of walks, about once a week or so,"
1047,"and letters and notes became frequent. I won't pretend things were not"
1047,"keenly personal between us, but they had an air of being innocently"
1047,"mental. She used to call me ""Master"" in our talks, a monstrous and"
1047,"engaging flattery, and I was inordinately proud to have her as my pupil."
1047,"Who wouldn't have been? And we went on at that distance for a long"
1047,"time--until within a year of the Handitch election."
1047,""
1047,"After Lady Colbeck threw her up as altogether too ""intellectual"" for"
1047,"comfortable control, Isabel was taken up by the Balfes in a less formal"
1047,"and compromising manner, and week-ended with them and their cousin"
1047,"Leonora Sparling, and spent large portions of her summer with them in"
1047,"Herefordshire. There was a lover or so in that time, men who came a"
1047,"little timidly at this brilliant young person with the frank manner and"
1047,"the Amazonian mind, and, she declared, received her kindly refusals with"
1047,"manifest relief. And Arnold Shoesmith struck up a sort of friendship"
1047,"that oddly imitated mine. She took a liking to him because he was clumsy"
1047,"and shy and inexpressive; she embarked upon the dangerous interest of"
1047,"helping him to find his soul. I had some twinges of jealousy about that."
1047,"I didn't see the necessity of him. He invaded her time, and I thought"
1047,"that might interfere with her work. If their friendship stole some hours"
1047,"from Isabel's writing, it did not for a long while interfere with our"
1047,"walks or our talks, or the close intimacy we had together."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"4"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"Then suddenly Isabel and I found ourselves passionately in love."
1047,""
1047,"The change came so entirely without warning or intention that I find it"
1047,"impossible now to tell the order of its phases. What disturbed pebble"
1047,"started the avalanche I cannot trace. Perhaps it was simply that the"
1047,"barriers between us and this masked aspect of life had been wearing down"
1047,"unperceived."
1047,""
1047,"And there came a change in Isabel. It was like some change in the cycle"
1047,"of nature, like the onset of spring--a sharp brightness, an uneasiness."
1047,"She became restless with her work; little encounters with men began to"
1047,"happen, encounters not quite in the quality of the earlier proposals;"
1047,"and then came an odd incident of which she told me, but somehow, I felt,"
1047,"didn't tell me completely. She told me all she was able to tell me."
1047,"She had been at a dance at the Ropers', and a man, rather well known in"
1047,"London, had kissed her. The thing amazed her beyond measure. It was the"
1047,"sort of thing immediately possible between any man and any woman, that"
1047,"one never expects to happen until it happens. It had the surprising"
1047,"effect of a judge generally known to be bald suddenly whipping off his"
1047,"wig in court. No absolutely unexpected revelation could have quite the"
1047,"same quality of shock. She went through the whole thing to me with a"
1047,"remarkable detachment, told me how she had felt--and the odd things it"
1047,"seemed to open to her."
1047,""
1047,"""I WANT to be kissed, and all that sort of thing,"" she avowed. ""I"
1047,"suppose every woman does."""
1047,""
1047,"She added after a pause: ""And I don't want any one to do it."""
1047,""
1047,"This struck me as queerly expressive of the woman's attitude to these"
1047,"things. ""Some one presently will--solve that,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""Some one will perhaps."""
1047,""
1047,"I was silent."
1047,""
1047,"""Some one will,"" she said, almost viciously. ""And then we'll have to"
1047,"stop these walks and talks of ours, dear Master.... I'll be sorry to"
1047,"give them up."""
1047,""
1047,"""It's part of the requirements of the situation,"" I said, ""that he"
1047,"should be--oh, very interesting! He'll start, no doubt, all sorts of new"
1047,"topics, and open no end of attractive vistas.... You can't, you know,"
1047,"always go about in a state of pupillage."""
1047,""
1047,"""I don't think I can,"" said Isabel. ""But it's only just recently I've"
1047,"begun to doubt about it."""
1047,""
1047,"I remember these things being said, but just how much we saw and"
1047,"understood, and just how far we were really keeping opaque to each other"
1047,"then, I cannot remember. But it must have been quite soon after this"
1047,"that we spent nearly a whole day together at Kew Gardens, with the"
1047,"curtains up and the barriers down, and the thing that had happened plain"
1047,"before our eyes. I don't remember we ever made any declaration. We just"
1047,"assumed the new footing...."
1047,""
1047,"It was a day early in that year--I think in January, because there was"
1047,"thin, crisp snow on the grass, and we noted that only two other people"
1047,"had been to the Pagoda that day. I've a curious impression of greenish"
1047,"colour, hot, moist air and huge palm fronds about very much of our talk,"
1047,"as though we were nearly all the time in the Tropical House. But I"
1047,"also remember very vividly looking at certain orange and red spray-like"
1047,"flowers from Patagonia, which could not have been there. It is a curious"
1047,"thing that I do not remember we made any profession of passionate love"
1047,"for one another; we talked as though the fact of our intense love for"
1047,"each other had always been patent between us. There was so long and"
1047,"frank an intimacy between us that we talked far more like brother and"
1047,"sister or husband and wife than two people engaged in the war of the"
1047,"sexes. We wanted to know what we were going to do, and whatever we"
1047,"did we meant to do in the most perfect concert. We both felt an"
1047,"extraordinary accession of friendship and tenderness then, and, what"
1047,"again is curious, very little passion. But there was also, in spite of"
1047,"the perplexities we faced, an immense satisfaction about that day. It"
1047,"was as if we had taken off something that had hindered our view of each"
1047,"other, like people who unvizored to talk more easily at a masked ball."
1047,""
1047,"I've had since to view our relations from the standpoint of the ordinary"
1047,"observer. I find that vision in the most preposterous contrast with all"
1047,"that really went on between us. I suppose there I should figure as a"
1047,"wicked seducer, while an unprotected girl succumbed to my fascinations."
1047,"As a matter of fact, it didn't occur to us that there was any personal"
1047,"inequality between us. I knew her for my equal mentally; in so many"
1047,"things she was beyond comparison cleverer than I; her courage outwent"
1047,"mine. The quick leap of her mind evoked a flash of joy in mine like the"
1047,"response of an induction wire; her way of thinking was like watching"
1047,"sunlight reflected from little waves upon the side of a boat, it was so"
1047,"bright, so mobile, so variously and easily true to its law. In the back"
1047,"of our minds we both had a very definite belief that making love is full"
1047,"of joyous, splendid, tender, and exciting possibilities, and we had to"
1047,"discuss why we shouldn't be to the last degree lovers."
1047,""
1047,"Now, what I should like to print here, if it were possible, in all the"
1047,"screaming emphasis of red ink, is this: that the circumstances of my"
1047,"upbringing and the circumstances of Isabel's upbringing had left not a"
1047,"shadow of belief or feeling that the utmost passionate love between"
1047,"us was in itself intrinsically WRONG. I've told with the fullest"
1047,"particularity just all that I was taught or found out for myself"
1047,"in these matters, and Isabel's reading and thinking, and the fierce"
1047,"silences of her governesses and the breathless warnings of teachers, and"
1047,"all the social and religious influences that had been brought to bear"
1047,"upon her, had worked out to the same void of conviction. The code had"
1047,"failed with us altogether. We didn't for a moment consider anything but"
1047,"the expediency of what we both, for all our quiet faces and steady eyes,"
1047,"wanted most passionately to do."
1047,""
1047,"Well, here you have the state of mind of whole brigades of people, and"
1047,"particularly of young people, nowadays. The current morality hasn't"
1047,"gripped them; they don't really believe in it at all. They may render"
1047,"it lip-service, but that is quite another thing. There are scarcely any"
1047,"tolerable novels to justify its prohibitions; its prohibitions do, in"
1047,"fact, remain unjustified amongst these ugly suppressions. You may, if"
1047,"you choose, silence the admission of this in literature and current"
1047,"discussion; you will not prevent it working out in lives. People come up"
1047,"to the great moments of passion crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared"
1047,"as no really civilised and intelligently planned community would let any"
1047,"one be unprepared. They find themselves hedged about with customs"
1047,"that have no organic hold upon them, and mere discretions all generous"
1047,"spirits are disposed to despise."
1047,""
1047,"Consider the infinite absurdities of it! Multitudes of us are trying"
1047,"to run this complex modern community on a basis of ""Hush"" without"
1047,"explaining to our children or discussing with them anything about"
1047,"love and marriage at all. Doubt and knowledge creep about in enforced"
1047,"darknesses and silences. We are living upon an ancient tradition which"
1047,"everybody doubts and nobody has ever analysed. We affect a tremendous"
1047,"and cultivated shyness and delicacy about imperatives of the most"
1047,"arbitrary appearance. What ensues? What did ensue with us, for example?"
1047,"On the one hand was a great desire, robbed of any appearance of shame"
1047,"and grossness by the power of love, and on the other hand, the possible"
1047,"jealousy of so and so, the disapproval of so and so, material risks and"
1047,"dangers. It is only in the retrospect that we have been able to grasp"
1047,"something of the effectual case against us. The social prohibition lit"
1047,"by the intense glow of our passion, presented itself as preposterous,"
1047,"irrational, arbitrary, and ugly, a monster fit only for mockery. We"
1047,"might be ruined! Well, there is a phase in every love affair, a sort"
1047,"of heroic hysteria, when death and ruin are agreeable additions to the"
1047,"prospect. It gives the business a gravity, a solemnity. Timid people may"
1047,"hesitate and draw back with a vague instinctive terror of the immensity"
1047,"of the oppositions they challenge, but neither Isabel nor I are timid"
1047,"people."
1047,""
1047,"We weighed what was against us. We decided just exactly as scores of"
1047,"thousands of people have decided in this very matter, that if it were"
1047,"possible to keep this thing to ourselves, there was nothing against it."
1047,"And so we took our first step. With the hunger of love in us, it was"
1047,"easy to conclude we might be lovers, and still keep everything to"
1047,"ourselves. That cleared our minds of the one persistent obstacle that"
1047,"mattered to us--the haunting presence of Margaret."
1047,""
1047,"And then we found, as all those scores of thousands of people scattered"
1047,"about us have found, that we could not keep it to ourselves. Love will"
1047,"out. All the rest of this story is the chronicle of that. Love with"
1047,"sustained secrecy cannot be love. It is just exactly the point people do"
1047,"not understand."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"5"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"But before things came to that pass, some months and many phases and a"
1047,"sudden journey to America intervened."
1047,""
1047,"""This thing spells disaster,"" I said. ""You are too big and I am too big"
1047,"to attempt this secrecy. Think of the intolerable possibility of being"
1047,"found out! At any cost we have to stop--even at the cost of parting."""

1047,"""Just because we may be found out!"""

1047,"""Just because we may be found out."""

1047,""
1047,"""Wait till it happens."""
1047,""
1047,"There followed a struggle of immense insincerity between us. It is hard"
1047,"to tell who urged and who resisted."
1047,""
1047,"She came to me one night to the editorial room of the BLUE WEEKLY, and"
1047,"argued and kissed me with wet salt lips, and wept in my arms; she told"
1047,"me that now passionate longing for me and my intimate life possessed"
1047,"her, so that she could not work, could not think, could not endure other"
1047,"people for the love of me...."
1047,""
1047,"I fled absurdly. That is the secret of the futile journey to America"
1047,"that puzzled all my friends."
1047,""
1047,"I ran away from Isabel. I took hold of the situation with all my"
1047,"strength, put in Britten with sketchy, hasty instructions to edit the"

1047,"things, my shaving things were omitted, upon a tour round the world."
1047,""
1047,"Preposterous flight that was! I remember as a thing almost farcical my"
1047,"explanations to Margaret, and how frantically anxious I was to prevent"

1047,"TUSCAN, a bad, wet boat, and mixed seasickness with ungovernable sorrow."

1047,"how I hated my fellow-passengers!"

1047,"New York inflamed and excited me for a time, and when things slackened,"

1047,"train from shoals of little dishes, with a sort of desperate voracity."
1047,"I did the queerest things to distract myself--no novelist would dare to"
1047,"invent my mental and emotional muddle. Chicago also held me at first,"
1047,"amazing lapse from civilisation that the place is! and then abruptly,"
1047,"with hosts expecting me, and everything settled for some days in Denver,"
1047,"I found myself at the end of my renunciations, and turned and came back"
1047,"headlong to London."
1047,""
1047,"Let me confess it wasn't any sense of perfect and incurable trust and"
1047,"confidence that brought me back, or any idea that now I had strength to"
1047,"refrain. It was a sudden realisation that after all the separation might"
1047,"succeed; some careless phrasing in one of her jealously read letters set"
1047,"that idea going in my mind--the haunting perception that I might return"
1047,"to London and find it empty of the Isabel who had pervaded it. Honour,"
1047,"discretion, the careers of both of us, became nothing at the thought. I"
1047,"couldn't conceive my life resuming there without Isabel. I couldn't, in"
1047,"short, stand it."
1047,""
1047,"I don't even excuse my return. It is inexcusable. I ought to have kept"
1047,"upon my way westward--and held out. I couldn't. I wanted Isabel, and"
1047,"I wanted her so badly now that everything else in the world was"
1047,"phantom-like until that want was satisfied. Perhaps you have never"
1047,"wanted anything like that. I went straight to her."
1047,""
1047,"But here I come to untellable things. There is no describing the reality"
1047,"of love. The shapes of things are nothing, the actual happenings are"
1047,"nothing, except that somehow there falls a light upon them and a wonder."
1047,"Of how we met, and the thrill of the adventure, the curious bright sense"
1047,"of defiance, the joy of having dared, I can't tell--I can but hint of"
1047,"just one aspect, of what an amazing LARK--it's the only word--it seemed"
1047,"to us. The beauty which was the essence of it, which justifies it so far"
1047,"as it will bear justification, eludes statement."
1047,""
1047,"What can a record of contrived meetings, of sundering difficulties"
1047,"evaded and overcome, signify here? Or what can it convey to say that"
1047,"one looked deep into two dear, steadfast eyes, or felt a heart throb"
1047,"and beat, or gripped soft hair softly in a trembling hand? Robbed of"
1047,"encompassing love, these things are of no more value than the taste of"
1047,"good wine or the sight of good pictures, or the hearing of music,--just"
1047,"sensuality and no more. No one can tell love--we can only tell the gross"
1047,"facts of love and its consequences. Given love--given mutuality, and one"
1047,"has effected a supreme synthesis and come to a new level of life--but"
1047,"only those who know can know. This business has brought me more"
1047,"bitterness and sorrow than I had ever expected to bear, but even now"
1047,"I will not say that I regret that wilful home-coming altogether. We"
1047,"loved--to the uttermost. Neither of us could have loved any one else"
1047,"as we did and do love one another. It was ours, that beauty; it existed"
1047,"only between us when we were close together, for no one in the world"
1047,"ever to know save ourselves."
1047,""
1047,"My return to the office sticks out in my memory with an extreme"
1047,"vividness, because of the wild eagle of pride that screamed within me."
1047,"It was Tuesday morning, and though not a soul in London knew of it yet"
1047,"except Isabel, I had been back in England a week. I came in upon Britten"
1047,"and stood in the doorway."
1047,""
1047,"""GOD!"" he said at the sight of me."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm back,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"He looked at my excited face with those red-brown eyes of his. Silently"
1047,"I defied him to speak his mind."
1047,""
1047,"""Where did you turn back?"" he said at last."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"6"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I had to tell what were, so far as I can remember my first positive lies"
1047,"to Margaret in explaining that return. I had written to her from Chicago"
1047,"and again from New York, saying that I felt I ought to be on the spot"
1047,"in England for the new session, and that I was coming back--presently."
1047,"I concealed the name of my boat from her, and made a calculated"
1047,"prevarication when I announced my presence in London. I telephoned"
1047,"before I went back for my rooms to be prepared. She was, I knew, with"
1047,"the Bunting Harblows in Durham, and when she came back to Radnor Square"
1047,"I had been at home a day."
1047,""
1047,"I remember her return so well."
1047,""
1047,"My going away and the vivid secret of the present had wiped out from my"
1047,"mind much of our long estrangement. Something, too, had changed in her."
1047,"I had had some hint of it in her letters, but now I saw it plainly. I"
1047,"came out of my study upon the landing when I heard the turmoil of her"
1047,"arrival below, and she came upstairs with a quickened gladness. It was a"
1047,"cold March, and she was dressed in unfamiliar dark furs that suited her"
1047,"extremely and reinforced the delicate flush of her sweet face. She held"
1047,"out both her hands to me, and drew me to her unhesitatingly and kissed"
1047,"me."
1047,""
1047,"""So glad you are back, dear,"" she said. ""Oh! so very glad you are back."""
1047,""
1047,"I returned her kiss with a queer feeling at my heart, too"
1047,"undifferentiated to be even a definite sense of guilt or meanness. I"
1047,"think it was chiefly amazement--at the universe--at myself."
1047,""
1047,"""I never knew what it was to be away from you,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"I perceived suddenly that she had resolved to end our estrangement. She"
1047,"put herself so that my arm came caressingly about her."
1047,""
1047,"""These are jolly furs,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""I got them for you."""
1047,""
1047,"The parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage"
1047,"cab."
1047,""
1047,"""Tell me all about America,"" said Margaret. ""I feel as though you'd been"
1047,"away six year's."""
1047,""
1047,"We went arm in arm into our little sitting-room, and I took off the"
1047,"fur's for her and sat down upon the chintz-covered sofa by the fire."
1047,"She had ordered tea, and came and sat by me. I don't know what I had"
1047,"expected, but of all things I had certainly not expected this sudden"
1047,"abolition of our distances."
1047,""
1047,"""I want to know all about America,"" she repeated, with her eyes"
1047,"scrutinising me. ""Why did you come back?"""
1047,""
1047,"I repeated the substance of my letters rather lamely, and she sat"
1047,"listening."
1047,""
1047,"""But why did you turn back--without going to Denver?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I wanted to come back. I was restless."""
1047,""
1047,"""Restlessness,"" she said, and thought. ""You were restless in Venice. You"
1047,"said it was restlessness took you to America."""
1047,""
1047,"Again she studied me. She turned a little awkwardly to her tea things,"
1047,"and poured needless water from the silver kettle into the teapot."
1047,"Then she sat still for some moments looking at the equipage with"
1047,"expressionless eyes. I saw her hand upon the edge of the table tremble"
1047,"slightly. I watched her closely. A vague uneasiness possessed me. What"
1047,"might she not know or guess?"
1047,""
1047,"She spoke at last with an effort. ""I wish you were in Parliament again,"""
1047,"she said. ""Life doesn't give you events enough."""
1047,""
1047,"""If I was in Parliament again, I should be on the Conservative side."""
1047,""
1047,"""I know,"" she said, and was still more thoughtful."
1047,""
1047,"""Lately,"" she began, and paused. ""Lately I've been reading--you."""
1047,""
1047,"I didn't help her out with what she had to say. I waited."
1047,""
1047,"""I didn't understand what you were after. I had misjudged. I didn't"
1047,"know. I think perhaps I was rather stupid."" Her eyes were suddenly"
1047,"shining with tears. ""You didn't give me much chance to understand."""
1047,""
1047,"She turned upon me suddenly with a voice full of tears."
1047,""
1047,"""Husband,"" she said abruptly, holding her two hands out to me, ""I want"
1047,"to begin over again!"""
1047,""
1047,"I took her hands, perplexed beyond measure. ""My dear!"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""I want to begin over again."""
1047,""
1047,"I bowed my head to hide my face, and found her hand in mine and kissed"
1047,"it."
1047,""
1047,"""Ah!"" she said, and slowly withdrew her hand. She leant forward with her"
1047,"arm on the sofa-back, and looked very intently into my face. I felt the"
1047,"most damnable scoundrel in the world as I returned her gaze. The thought"
1047,"of Isabel's darkly shining eyes seemed like a physical presence between"
1047,"us...."
1047,""
1047,"""Tell me,"" I said presently, to break the intolerable tension, ""tell me"
1047,"plainly what you mean by this."""
1047,""
1047,"I sat a little away from her, and then took my teacup in hand, with an"
1047,"odd effect of defending myself. ""Have you been reading that old book of"
1047,"mine?"" I asked."
1047,""
1047,"""That and the paper. I took a complete set from the beginning down"
1047,"to Durham with me. I have read it over, thought it over. I didn't"
1047,"understand--what you were teaching."""
1047,""
1047,"There was a little pause."
1047,""
1047,"""It all seems so plain to me now,"" she said, ""and so true."""
1047,""
1047,"I was profoundly disconcerted. I put down my teacup, stood up in the"
1047,"middle of the hearthrug, and began talking. ""I'm tremendously glad,"
1047,"Margaret, that you've come to see I'm not altogether perverse,"" I began."
1047,"I launched out into a rather trite and windy exposition of my views, and"
1047,"she sat close to me on the sofa, looking up into my face, hanging on my"
1047,"words, a deliberate and invincible convert."
1047,""
1047,"""Yes,"" she said, ""yes.""..."
1047,""
1047,"I had never doubted my new conceptions before; now I doubted them"
1047,"profoundly. But I went on talking. It's the grim irony in the lives of"
1047,"all politicians, writers, public teachers, that once the audience is at"
1047,"their feet, a new loyalty has gripped them. It isn't their business to"
1047,"admit doubt and imperfections. They have to go on talking. And I was"
1047,"now so accustomed to Isabel's vivid interruptions, qualifications,"
1047,"restatements, and confirmations...."
1047,""
1047,"Margaret and I dined together at home. She made me open out my political"
1047,"projects to her. ""I have been foolish,"" she said. ""I want to help."""
1047,""
1047,"And by some excuse I have forgotten she made me come to her room. I"
1047,"think it was some book I had to take her, some American book I had"
1047,"brought back with me, and mentioned in our talk. I walked in with it,"
1047,"and put it down on the table and turned to go."
1047,""
1047,"""Husband!"" she cried, and held out her slender arms to me. I was"
1047,"compelled to go to her and kiss her, and she twined them softly about my"
1047,"neck and drew me to her and kissed me. I disentangled them very gently,"
1047,"and took each wrist and kissed it, and the backs of her hands."
1047,""
1047,"""Good-night,"" I said. There came a little pause. ""Good-night, Margaret,"""
1047,"I repeated, and walked very deliberately and with a kind of sham"
1047,"preoccupation to the door."
1047,""
1047,"I did not look at her, but I could feel her standing, watching me. If I"
1047,"had looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to me...."
1047,""
1047,"At the very outset that secret, which was to touch no one but Isabel and"
1047,"myself, had reached out to stab another human being."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"7"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"The whole world had changed for Isabel and me; and we tried to pretend"
1047,"that nothing had changed except a small matter between us. We believed"
1047,"quite honestly at that time that it was possible to keep this thing"
1047,"that had happened from any reaction at all, save perhaps through some"
1047,"magically enhanced vigour in our work, upon the world about us! Seen in"
1047,"retrospect, one can realise the absurdity of this belief; within a week"
1047,"I realised it; but that does not alter the fact that we did believe as"
1047,"much, and that people who are deeply in love and unable to marry will"
1047,"continue to believe so to the very end of time. They will continue to"
1047,"believe out of existence every consideration that separates them until"
1047,"they have come together. Then they will count the cost, as we two had to"
1047,"do."
1047,""
1047,"I am telling a story, and not propounding theories in this book; and"
1047,"chiefly I am telling of the ideas and influences and emotions that"
1047,"have happened to me--me as a sort of sounding board for my world. The"
1047,"moralist is at liberty to go over my conduct with his measure and"
1047,"say, ""At this point or at that you went wrong, and you ought to have"
1047,"done""--so-and-so. The point of interest to the statesman is that it"
1047,"didn't for a moment occur to us to do so-and-so when the time for doing"
1047,"it came. It amazes me now to think how little either of us troubled"
1047,"about the established rights or wrongs of the situation. We hadn't an"
1047,"atom of respect for them, innate or acquired. The guardians of public"
1047,"morals will say we were very bad people; I submit in defence that they"
1047,"are very bad guardians--provocative guardians.... And when at last there"
1047,"came a claim against us that had an effective validity for us, we were"
1047,"in the full tide of passionate intimacy."
1047,""
1047,"I had a night of nearly sleepless perplexity after Margaret's return."
1047,"She had suddenly presented herself to me like something dramatically"
1047,"recalled, fine, generous, infinitely capable of feeling. I was amazed"
1047,"how much I had forgotten her. In my contempt for vulgarised and"
1047,"conventionalised honour I had forgotten that for me there was such"
1047,"a reality as honour. And here it was, warm and near to me, living,"
1047,"breathing, unsuspecting. Margaret's pride was my honour, that I had had"
1047,"no right even to imperil."
1047,""
1047,"I do not now remember if I thought at that time of going to Isabel and"
1047,"putting this new aspect of the case before her. Perhaps I did. Perhaps"
1047,"I may have considered even then the possibility of ending what had so"
1047,"freshly and passionately begun. If I did, it vanished next day at"
1047,"the sight of her. Whatever regrets came in the darkness, the daylight"
1047,"brought an obstinate confidence in our resolution again. We would, we"
1047,"declared, ""pull the thing off."" Margaret must not know. Margaret should"
1047,"not know. If Margaret did not know, then no harm whatever would be done."
1047,"We tried to sustain that...."
1047,""
1047,"For a brief time we had been like two people in a magic cell, magically"
1047,"cut off from the world and full of a light of its own, and then we began"
1047,"to realise that we were not in the least cut off, that the world was all"
1047,"about us and pressing in upon us, limiting us, threatening us, resuming"
1047,"possession of us. I tried to ignore the injury to Margaret of her"
1047,"unreciprocated advances. I tried to maintain to myself that this hidden"
1047,"love made no difference to the now irreparable breach between husband"
1047,"and wife. But I never spoke of it to Isabel or let her see that aspect"
1047,"of our case. How could I? The time for that had gone...."
1047,""
1047,"Then in new shapes and relations came trouble. Distressful elements"
1047,"crept in by reason of our unavoidable furtiveness; we ignored them,"
1047,"hid them from each other, and attempted to hide them from ourselves."
1047,"Successful love is a thing of abounding pride, and we had to be secret."
1047,"It was delightful at first to be secret, a whispering, warm conspiracy;"
1047,"then presently it became irksome and a little shameful. Her essential"
1047,"frankness of soul was all against the masks and falsehoods that many"
1047,"women would have enjoyed. Together in our secrecy we relaxed, then in"
1047,"the presence of other people again it was tiresome to have to watch"
1047,"for the careless, too easy phrase, to snatch back one's hand from the"
1047,"limitless betrayal of a light, familiar touch."
1047,""
1047,"Love becomes a poor thing, at best a poor beautiful thing, if it"
1047,"develops no continuing and habitual intimacy. We were always meeting,"
1047,"and most gloriously loving and beginning--and then we had to snatch at"
1047,"remorseless ticking watches, hurry to catch trains, and go back to this"
1047,"or that. That is all very well for the intrigues of idle people perhaps,"
1047,"but not for an intense personal relationship. It is like lighting a"
1047,"candle for the sake of lighting it, over and over again, and each time"
1047,"blowing it out. That, no doubt, must be very amusing to children playing"
1047,"with the matches, but not to people who love warm light, and want it in"
1047,"order to do fine and honourable things together. We had achieved--I"
1047,"give the ugly phrase that expresses the increasing discolouration in my"
1047,"mind--""illicit intercourse."" To end at that, we now perceived, wasn't in"
1047,"our style. But where were we to end?..."
1047,""
1047,"Perhaps we might at this stage have given it up. I think if we could"
1047,"have seen ahead and around us we might have done so. But the glow of our"
1047,"cell blinded us.... I wonder what might have happened if at that time we"
1047,"had given it up.... We propounded it, we met again in secret to discuss"
1047,"it, and our overpowering passion for one another reduced that meeting to"
1047,"absurdity...."
1047,""
1047,"Presently the idea of children crept between us. It came in from all our"
1047,"conceptions of life and public service; it was, we found, in the quality"
1047,"of our minds that physical love without children is a little weak,"
1047,"timorous, more than a little shameful. With imaginative people there"
1047,"very speedily comes a time when that realisation is inevitable. We"
1047,"hadn't thought of that before--it isn't natural to think of that before."
1047,"We hadn't known. There is no literature in English dealing with such"
1047,"things."
1047,""
1047,"There is a necessary sequence of phases in love. These came in their"
1047,"order, and with them, unanticipated tarnishings on the first bright"
1047,"perfection of our relations. For a time these developing phases were"
1047,"no more than a secret and private trouble between us, little shadows"
1047,"spreading by imperceptible degrees across that vivid and luminous cell."

1047,"The Handitch election flung me suddenly into prominence."

1047,"It is still only two years since that struggle, and I will not trouble"
1047,"the reader with a detailed history of events that must be quite"
1047,"sufficiently present in his mind for my purpose already. Huge stacks of"
1047,"journalism have dealt with Handitch and its significance. For the reader"
1047,"very probably, as for most people outside a comparatively small circle,"
1047,"it meant my emergence from obscurity. We obtruded no editor's name in"
1047,"the BLUE WEEKLY; I had never as yet been on the London hoardings. Before"
1047,"Handitch I was a journalist and writer of no great public standing;"
1047,"after Handitch, I was definitely a person, in the little group of"
1047,"persons who stood for the Young Imperialist movement. Handitch was, to a"
1047,"very large extent, my affair. I realised then, as a man comes to do, how"
1047,"much one can still grow after seven and twenty. In the second election"
1047,"I was a man taking hold of things; at Kinghamstead I had been simply a"
1047,"young candidate, a party unit, led about the constituency, told to"
1047,"do this and that, and finally washed in by the great Anti-Imperialist"
1047,"flood, like a starfish rolling up a beach."
1047,""
1047,"My feminist views had earnt the mistrust of the party, and I do not"
1047,"think I should have got the chance of Handitch or indeed any chance at"
1047,"all of Parliament for a long time, if it had not been that the seat with"
1047,"its long record of Liberal victories and its Liberal majority of 3642 at"
1047,"the last election, offered a hopeless contest. The Liberal dissensions"
1047,"and the belated but by no means contemptible Socialist candidate were"
1047,"providential interpositions. I think, however, the conduct of Gane,"
1047,"Crupp, and Tarvrille in coming down to fight for me, did count"
1047,"tremendously in my favour. ""We aren't going to win, perhaps,"" said"
1047,"Crupp, ""but we are going to talk."" And until the very eve of victory, we"
1047,"treated Handitch not so much as a battlefield as a hoarding. And so it"
1047,"was the Endowment of Motherhood as a practical form of Eugenics got into"
1047,"English politics."

1047,"They opened fire upon me in a little electioneering rag call"

1047,"misrepresentations that gave me an admirable text for a speech. I spoke"
1047,"for an hour and ten minutes with a more and more crumpled copy of the"
1047,"SENTINEL in my hand, and I made the fullest and completest exposition"
1047,"of the idea of endowing motherhood that I think had ever been made up"
1047,"to that time in England. Its effect on the press was extraordinary. The"
1047,"Liberal papers gave me quite unprecedented space under the impression"
1047,"that I had only to be given rope to hang myself; the Conservatives cut"
1047,"me down or tried to justify me; the whole country was talking. I had had"
1047,"a pamphlet in type upon the subject, and I revised this carefully and"
1047,"put it on the book-stalls within three days. It sold enormously and"
1047,"brought me bushels of letters. We issued over three thousand in Handitch"

1047,"But it was only with the declaration of the poll that my battle was won."
1047,"No one expected more than a snatch victory, and I was in by over fifteen"
1047,"hundred. At one bound Cossington's papers passed from apologetics varied"
1047,"by repudiation to triumphant praise. ""A renascent England, breeding"
1047,"men,"" said the leader in his chief daily on the morning after the"
1047,"polling, and claimed that the Conservatives had been ever the pioneers"

1047,"To any one who did not know of that glowing secret between Isabel and"
1047,"myself, I might well have appeared at that time the most successful and"
1047,"enviable of men. I had recovered rapidly from an uncongenial start"
1047,"in political life; I had become a considerable force through the BLUE"
1047,"WEEKLY, and was shaping an increasingly influential body of opinion; I"
1047,"had re-entered Parliament with quite dramatic distinction, and in spite"
1047,"of a certain faltering on the part of the orthodox Conservatives"
1047,"towards the bolder elements in our propaganda, I had loyal and unenvious"
1047,"associates who were making me a power in the party. People were coming"
1047,"to our group, understandings were developing. It was clear we should"
1047,"play a prominent part in the next general election, and that, given a"
1047,"Conservative victory, I should be assured of office. The world opened"
1047,"out to me brightly and invitingly. Great schemes took shape in my mind,"
1047,"always more concrete, always more practicable; the years ahead seemed"
1047,"falling into order, shining with the credible promise of immense"
1047,"achievement."
1047,""
1047,"And at the heart of it all, unseen and unsuspected, was the secret of my"
1047,"relations with Isabel--like a seed that germinates and thrusts, thrusts"
1047,"relentlessly."
1047,""
1047,"From the onset of the Handitch contest onward, my meetings with her had"
1047,"been more and more pervaded by the discussion of our situation. It had"
1047,"innumerable aspects. It was very present to us that we wanted to be"
1047,"together as much as possible--we were beginning to long very much for"
1047,"actual living together in the same house, so that one could come as"
1047,"it were carelessly--unawares--upon the other, busy perhaps about some"
1047,"trivial thing. We wanted to feel each other in the daily atmosphere."
1047,"Preceding our imperatively sterile passion, you must remember, outside"
1047,"it, altogether greater than it so far as our individual lives were"
1047,"concerned, there had grown and still grew an enormous affection and"
1047,"intellectual sympathy between us. We brought all our impressions and all"
1047,"our ideas to each other, to see them in each other's light. It is hard"
1047,"to convey that quality of intellectual unison to any one who has not"
1047,"experienced it. I thought more and more in terms of conversation with"
1047,"Isabel; her possible comments upon things would flash into my mind,"
1047,"oh!--with the very sound of her voice."
1047,""
1047,"I remember, too, the odd effect of seeing her in the distance going"
1047,"about Handitch, like any stranger canvasser; the queer emotion of her"
1047,"approach along the street, the greeting as she passed. The morning of"
1047,"the polling she vanished from the constituency. I saw her for an instant"
1047,"in the passage behind our Committee rooms."
1047,""
1047,"""Going?"" said I."
1047,""
1047,"She nodded."

1047,"""Stay it out. I want you to see the fun. I remember--the other time."""
1047,""
1047,"She didn't answer for a moment or so, and stood with face averted."
1047,""
1047,"""It's Margaret's show,"" she said abruptly. ""If I see her smiling there"
1047,"like a queen by your side--! She did--last time. I remember."" She caught"
1047,"at a sob and dashed her hand across her face impatiently. ""Jealous fool,"
1047,"mean and petty, jealous fool!... Good luck, old man, to you! You're"
1047,"going to win. But I don't want to see the end of it all the same...."""
1047,""
1047,"""Good-bye!"" said I, clasping her hand as some supporter appeared in the"
1047,"passage...."
1047,""
1047,"I came back to London victorious, and a little flushed and coarse with"
1047,"victory; and so soon as I could break away I went to Isabel's flat and"
1047,"found her white and worn, with the stain of secret weeping about her"
1047,"eyes. I came into the room to her and shut the door."
1047,""
1047,"""You said I'd win,"" I said, and held out my arms."

1047,""
1047,"We didn't speak for some seconds. Then she slipped from my hold. ""Look!"""

1047,"papers--the pile of them, and you--resounding."""
1047,""
1047,"""It's more than I dared hope."""
1047,""
1047,"""Or I."""

1047,"in my arms. ""The bigger you are--the more you show,"" she said--""the more"
1047,"we are parted. I know, I know--"""
1047,""
1047,"I held her close to me, making no answer."

1047,"Presently she became still. ""Oh, well,"" she said, and wiped her eyes and"
1047,"sat down on the little sofa by the fire; and I sat down beside her."

1047,"""I didn't know all there was in love,"" she said, staring at the coals,"
1047,"""when we went love-making."""

1047,"if I had nothing of you. You don't understand--how a woman wants a man."
1047,"I thought once if I just gave myself to you it would be enough. It was"
1047,"nothing--it was just a step across the threshold. My dear, every moment"
1047,"you are away I ache for you--ache! I want to be about when it isn't"
1047,"love-making or talk. I want to be doing things for you, and watching"
1047,"you when you're not thinking of me. All those safe, careless, intimate"
1047,"things. And something else--"" She stopped. ""Dear, I don't want to bother"
1047,"you. I just want you to know I love you...."""
1047,""
1047,"She caught my head in her hands and kissed it, then stood up abruptly."

1047,"I looked up at her, a little perplexed."

1047,"colleague, my right hand, the secret soul of my life--"""

1047,"""And I want to darn your socks,"" she said, smiling back at me."
1047,""
1047,"""You're insatiable."""
1047,""
1047,"She smiled ""No,"" she said. ""I'm not insatiable, Master. But I'm a woman"
1047,"in love. And I'm finding out what I want, and what is necessary to"
1047,"me--and what I can't have. That's all."""
1047,""
1047,"""We get a lot."""
1047,""
1047,"""We want a lot. You and I are greedy people for the things we like,"
1047,"Master. It's very evident we've got nearly all we can ever have of one"
1047,"another--and I'm not satisfied."""

1047,"""What more is there?"
1047,""
1047,"""For you--very little. I wonder. For me--every thing. Yes--everything."
1047,"You didn't mean it, Master; you didn't know any more than I did when I"
1047,"began, but love between a man and a woman is sometimes very one-sided."
1047,"Fearfully one-sided! That's all...."""
1047,""

1047,"trouble.... I can't have 'em, Master, and I can't have you."""
1047,""
1047,"She was crying, and through her tears she laughed."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm going to make a scene,"" she said, ""and get this over. I'm so"
1047,"discontented and miserable; I've got to tell you. It would come between"
1047,"us if I didn't. I'm in love with you, with everything--with all my"
1047,"brains. I'll pull through all right. I'll be good, Master, never you"
1047,"fear. But to-day I'm crying out with all my being. This election--You're"
1047,"going up; you're going on. In these papers--you're a great big fact."
1047,"It's suddenly come home to me. At the back of my mind I've always had"
1047,"the idea I was going to have you somehow presently for myself--I mean to"
1047,"have you to go long tramps with, to keep house for, to get meals for,"
1047,"to watch for of an evening. It's a sort of habitual background to my"
1047,"thought of you. And it's nonsense--utter nonsense!"" She stopped. She was"
1047,"crying and choking. ""And the child, you know--the child!"""
1047,""
1047,"I was troubled beyond measure, but Handitch and its intimations were"
1047,"clear and strong."
1047,""
1047,"""We can't have that,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""No,"" she said, ""we can't have that."""
1047,""
1047,"""We've got our own things to do."""
1047,""
1047,"""YOUR things,"" she said."

1047,"""Aren't they yours too?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Because of you,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"""Aren't they your very own things?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Women don't have that sort of very own thing. Indeed, it's true!"
1047,"And think! You've been down there preaching the goodness of children,"
1047,"telling them the only good thing in a state is happy, hopeful children,"
1047,"working to free mothers and children--"""
1047,""
1047,"""And we give our own children to do it?"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""Yes,"" she said. ""And sometimes I think it's too much to give--too much"
1047,"altogether.... Children get into a woman's brain--when she mustn't have"
1047,"them, especially when she must never hope for them. Think of the child"
1047,"we might have now!--the little creature with soft, tender skin, and"
1047,"little hands and little feet! At times it haunts me. It comes and says,"
1047,"Why wasn't I given life? I can hear it in the night.... The world is"
1047,"full of such little ghosts, dear lover--little things that asked for"
1047,"life and were refused. They clamour to me. It's like a little fist"
1047,"beating at my heart. Love children, beautiful children. Little cold"
1047,"hands that tear at my heart! Oh, my heart and my lord!"" She was holding"
1047,"my arm with both her hands and weeping against it, and now she drew"
1047,"herself to my shoulder and wept and sobbed in my embrace. ""I shall never"
1047,"sit with your child on my knee and you beside me-never, and I am a woman"
1047,"and your lover!..."""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"But the profound impossibility of our relation was now becoming more and"
1047,"more apparent to us. We found ourselves seeking justification, clinging"
1047,"passionately to a situation that was coldly, pitilessly, impossible and"
1047,"fated. We wanted quite intensely to live together and have a child, but"
1047,"also we wanted very many other things that were incompatible with these"
1047,"desires. It was extraordinarily difficult to weigh our political and"
1047,"intellectual ambitions against those intimate wishes. The weights kept"
1047,"altering according as one found oneself grasping this valued thing or"
1047,"that. It wasn't as if we could throw everything aside for our love,"
1047,"and have that as we wanted it. Love such as we bore one another isn't"
1047,"altogether, or even chiefly, a thing in itself--it is for the most part"
1047,"a value set upon things. Our love was interwoven with all our other"
1047,"interests; to go out of the world and live in isolation seemed to us"
1047,"like killing the best parts of each other; we loved the sight of each"
1047,"other engaged finely and characteristically, we knew each other best"
1047,"as activities. We had no delusions about material facts; we didn't want"
1047,"each other alive or dead, we wanted each other fully alive. We wanted"
1047,"to do big things together, and for us to take each other openly and"
1047,"desperately would leave us nothing in the world to do. We wanted"
1047,"children indeed passionately, but children with every helpful chance in"
1047,"the world, and children born in scandal would be handicapped at every"
1047,"turn. We wanted to share a home, and not a solitude."
1047,""
1047,"And when we were at this stage of realisation, began the intimations"
1047,"that we were found out, and that scandal was afoot against us...."
1047,""
1047,"I heard of it first from Esmeer, who deliberately mentioned it,"
1047,"with that steady grey eye of his watching me, as an instance of the"
1047,"preposterous falsehoods people will circulate. It came to Isabel"
1047,"almost simultaneously through a married college friend, who made it her"
1047,"business to demand either confirmation or denial. It filled us both with"
1047,"consternation. In the surprise of the moment Isabel admitted her secret,"
1047,"and her friend went off ""reserving her freedom of action."""
1047,""
1047,"Discovery broke out in every direction. Friends with grave faces and"
1047,"an atmosphere of infinite tact invaded us both. Other friends ceased to"
1047,"invade either of us. It was manifest we had become--we knew not how--a"
1047,"private scandal, a subject for duologues, an amazement, a perplexity,"
1047,"a vivid interest. In a few brief weeks it seemed London passed from"
1047,"absolute unsuspiciousness to a chattering exaggeration of its knowledge"
1047,"of our relations."
1047,""
1047,"It was just the most inappropriate time for that disclosure. The long"
1047,"smouldering antagonism to my endowment of motherhood ideas had flared"
1047,"up into an active campaign in the EXPURGATOR, and it would be altogether"
1047,"disastrous to us if I should be convicted of any personal irregularity."
1047,"It was just because of the manifest and challenging respectability of my"
1047,"position that I had been able to carry the thing as far as I had done."
1047,"Now suddenly my fortunes had sprung a leak, and scandal was pouring"
1047,"in.... It chanced, too, that a wave of moral intolerance was sweeping"
1047,"through London, one of those waves in which the bitterness of the"
1047,"consciously just finds an ally in the panic of the undiscovered. A"
1047,"certain Father Blodgett had been preaching against social corruption"
1047,"with extraordinary force, and had roused the Church of England people"
1047,"to a kind of competition in denunciation. The old methods of the"
1047,"Anti-Socialist campaign had been renewed, and had offered far too wide"
1047,"a scope and too tempting an opportunity for private animosity, to be"
1047,"restricted to the private affairs of the Socialists. I had intimations"
1047,"of an extensive circulation of ""private and confidential"" letters...."
1047,""
1047,"I think there can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving"
1047,"realisation that rumour and scandal are afoot about one. Abruptly"
1047,"one's confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears. One"
1047,"walks silenced through a world that one feels to be full of inaudible"
1047,"accusations. One cannot challenge the assault, get it out into the open,"
1047,"separate truth and falsehood. It slinks from you, turns aside its face."
1047,"Old acquaintances suddenly evaded me, made extraordinary excuses;"
1047,"men who had presumed on the verge of my world and pestered me with an"
1047,"intrusive enterprise, now took the bold step of flat repudiation. I"
1047,"became doubtful about the return of a nod, retracted all those tentacles"
1047,"of easy civility that I had hitherto spread to the world. I still grow"
1047,"warm with amazed indignation when I recall that Edward Crampton, meeting"
1047,"me full on the steps of the Climax Club, cut me dead. ""By God!"" I cried,"
1047,"and came near catching him by the throat and wringing out of him what"
1047,"of all good deeds and bad, could hearten him, a younger man than I and"
1047,"empty beyond comparison, to dare to play the judge to me. And then I had"
1047,"an open slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on as one counts"
1047,"upon the sunrise. I had not expected things of that sort; they were"
1047,"disconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way"
1047,"beneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential confidence"
1047,"of life, as though a hand of wet ice had touched my heart. Similar"
1047,"things were happening to Isabel. Yet we went on working, visiting,"
1047,"meeting, trying to ignore this gathering of implacable forces against"
1047,"us."
1047,""
1047,"For a time I was perplexed beyond measure to account for this campaign."
1047,"Then I got a clue. The centre of diffusion was the Bailey household. The"
1047,"Baileys had never forgiven me my abandonment of the young Liberal group"
1047,"they had done so much to inspire and organise; their dinner-table had"
1047,"long been a scene of hostile depreciation of the BLUE WEEKLY and all its"
1047,"allies; week after week Altiora proclaimed that I was ""doing nothing,"""
1047,"and found other causes for our bye-election triumphs; I counted Chambers"
1047,"Street a dangerous place for me. Yet, nevertheless, I was astonished to"
1047,"find them using a private scandal against me. They did. I think Handitch"
1047,"had filled up the measure of their bitterness, for I had not only"
1047,"abandoned them, but I was succeeding beyond even their power of"
1047,"misrepresentation. Always I had been a wasp in their spider's web,"
1047,"difficult to claim as a tool, uncritical, antagonistic. I admired their"
1047,"work and devotion enormously, but I had never concealed my contempt for"
1047,"a certain childish vanity they displayed, and for the frequent puerility"
1047,"of their political intrigues. I suppose contempt galls more than"
1047,"injuries, and anyhow they had me now. They had me. Bailey, I found,"
1047,"was warning fathers of girls against me as a ""reckless libertine,"" and"
1047,"Altiora, flushed, roguish, and dishevelled, was sitting on her fender"
1047,"curb after dinner, and pledging little parties of five or six women at a"
1047,"time with infinite gusto not to let the matter go further. Our cell was"
1047,"open to the world, and a bleak, distressful daylight streaming in."
1047,""
1047,"I had a gleam of a more intimate motive in Altiora from the reports that"
1047,"came to me. Isabel had been doing a series of five or six articles in"
1047,"the POLITICAL REVIEW in support of our campaign, the POLITICAL REVIEW"
1047,"which had hitherto been loyally Baileyite. Quite her best writing up to"
1047,"the present, at any rate, is in those papers, and no doubt Altiora had"
1047,"had not only to read her in those invaded columns, but listen to her"
1047,"praises in the mouths of the tactless influential. Altiora, like so many"
1047,"people who rely on gesture and vocal insistence in conversation, writes"
1047,"a poor and slovenly prose and handles an argument badly; Isabel has her"
1047,"University training behind her and wrote from the first with the stark"
1047,"power of a clear-headed man. ""Now we know,"" said Altiora, with just a"
1047,"gleam of malice showing through her brightness, ""now we know who helps"
1047,"with the writing!"""
1047,""
1047,"She revealed astonishing knowledge."
1047,""
1047,"For a time I couldn't for the life of me discover her sources. I had,"
1047,"indeed, a desperate intention of challenging her, and then I bethought"
1047,"me of a youngster named Curmain, who had been my supplemental typist and"
1047,"secretary for a time, and whom I had sent on to her before the days of"
1047,"our breach. ""Of course!"" said I, ""Curmain!"" He was a tall, drooping,"
1047,"sidelong youth with sandy hair, a little forward head, and a long"
1047,"thin neck. He stole stamps, and, I suspected, rifled my private letter"
1047,"drawer, and I found him one day on a turn of the stairs looking guilty"
1047,"and ruffled with a pretty Irish housemaid of Margaret's manifestly in"
1047,"a state of hot indignation. I saw nothing, but I felt everything in the"
1047,"air between them. I hate this pestering of servants, but at the same"
1047,"time I didn't want Curmain wiped out of existence, so I had packed him"
1047,"off without unnecessary discussion to Altiora. He was quick and cheap"
1047,"anyhow, and I thought her general austerity ought to redeem him if"
1047,"anything could; the Chambers Street housemaid wasn't for any man's"
1047,"kissing and showed it, and the stamps and private letters were looked"
1047,"after with an efficiency altogether surpassing mine. And Altiora, I've"
1047,"no doubt left now whatever, pumped this young undesirable about me,"
1047,"and scenting a story, had him to dinner alone one evening to get to the"
1047,"bottom of the matter. She got quite to the bottom of it,--it must have"
1047,"been a queer duologue. She read Isabel's careless, intimate letters"
1047,"to me, so to speak, by this proxy, and she wasn't ashamed to use this"
1047,"information in the service of the bitterness that had sprung up in her"
1047,"since our political breach. It was essentially a personal bitterness; it"
1047,"helped no public purpose of theirs to get rid of me. My downfall in"
1047,"any public sense was sheer waste,--the loss of a man. She knew she was"
1047,"behaving badly, and so, when it came to remonstrance, she behaved worse."
1047,"She'd got names and dates and places; the efficiency of her information"
1047,"was irresistible. And she set to work at it marvellously. Never before,"
1047,"in all her pursuit of efficient ideals, had Altiora achieved such levels"
1047,"of efficiency. I wrote a protest that was perhaps ill-advised and angry,"
1047,"I went to her and tried to stop her. She wouldn't listen, she wouldn't"
1047,"think, she denied and lied, she behaved like a naughty child of six"
1047,"years old which has made up its mind to be hurtful. It wasn't only, I"
1047,"think, that she couldn't bear our political and social influence; she"
1047,"also--I realised at that interview couldn't bear our loving. It seemed"
1047,"to her the sickliest thing,--a thing quite unendurable. While such"

1047,"Ever! I didn't know you could. Oh! my dear! Can't you have her, my dear,"
1047,"if you want her? I can't bear it! Let me help you, dear. Oh! my Husband!"
1047,"My Man! I can't bear to have you cry!"" For a time she held me in"
1047,"silence."
1047,""
1047,"""I've thought this might happen, I dreamt it might happen. You two, I"
1047,"mean. It was dreaming put it into my head. When I've seen you together,"
1047,"so glad with each other.... Oh! Husband mine, believe me! believe me!"
1047,"I'm stupid, I'm cold, I'm only beginning to realise how stupid and cold,"

1047,""
1047,""
1047,"""We can't part in a room,"" said Isabel."
1047,""
1047,"""We'll have one last talk together,"" I said, and planned that we should"
1047,"meet for a half a day between Dover and Walmer and talk ourselves out."
1047,"I still recall that day very well, recall even the curious exaltation of"
1047,"grief that made our mental atmosphere distinctive and memorable. We had"
1047,"seen so much of one another, had become so intimate, that we talked of"
1047,"parting even as we parted with a sense of incredible remoteness. We went"
1047,"together up over the cliffs, and to a place where they fall towards the"
1047,"sea, past the white, quaint-lanterned lighthouses of the South Foreland."
1047,"There, in a kind of niche below the crest, we sat talking. It was a"
1047,"spacious day, serenely blue and warm, and on the wrinkled water remotely"
1047,"below a black tender and six hooded submarines came presently, and"
1047,"engaged in mysterious manoeuvers. Shrieking gulls and chattering"
1047,"jackdaws circled over us and below us, and dived and swooped; and a"
1047,"skerry of weedy, fallen chalk appeared, and gradually disappeared again,"
1047,"as the tide fell and rose."
1047,""
1047,"We talked and thought that afternoon on every aspect of our relations."
1047,"It seems to me now we talked so wide and far that scarcely an issue in"
1047,"the life between man and woman can arise that we did not at least touch"
1047,"upon. Lying there at Isabel's feet, I have become for myself a symbol of"
1047,"all this world-wide problem between duty and conscious, passionate love"
1047,"the world has still to solve. Because it isn't solved; there's a wrong"
1047,"in it either way.. .. The sky, the wide horizon, seemed to lift us out"
1047,"of ourselves until we were something representative and general. She was"
1047,"womanhood become articulate, talking to her lover."
1047,""
1047,"""I ought,"" I said, ""never to have loved you."""
1047,""
1047,"""It wasn't a thing planned,"" she said."
1047,""
1047,"""I ought never to have let our talk slip to that, never to have turned"
1047,"back from America."""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm glad we did it,"" she said. ""Don't think I repent."""
1047,""
1047,"I looked at her."
1047,""
1047,"""I will never repent,"" she said. ""Never!"" as though she clung to her"
1047,"life in saying it."
1047,""
1047,"I remember we talked for a long time of divorce. It seemed to us then,"
1047,"and it seems to us still, that it ought to have been possible for"
1047,"Margaret to divorce me, and for me to marry without the scandalous and"
1047,"ugly publicity, the taint and ostracism that follow such a readjustment."
1047,"We went on to the whole perplexing riddle of marriage. We criticised"
1047,"the current code, how muddled and conventionalised it had become, how"
1047,"modified by subterfuges and concealments and new necessities, and the"
1047,"increasing freedom of women. ""It's all like Bromstead when the building"
1047,"came,"" I said; for I had often talked to her of that early impression of"
1047,"purpose dissolving again into chaotic forces. ""There is no clear right"
1047,"in the world any more. The world is Byzantine. The justest man to-day"
1047,"must practise a tainted goodness."""
1047,""
1047,"These questions need discussion--a magnificent frankness of"
1047,"discussion--if any standards are again to establish an effective hold"
1047,"upon educated people. Discretions, as I have said already, will never"
1047,"hold any one worth holding--longer than they held us. Against every"
1047,"""shalt not"" there must be a ""why not"" plainly put,--the ""why not"""
1047,"largest and plainest, the law deduced from its purpose. ""You and I,"
1047,"Isabel,"" I said, ""have always been a little disregardful of duty, partly"
1047,"at least because the idea of duty comes to us so ill-clad. Oh! I know"
1047,"there's an extravagant insubordinate strain in us, but that wasn't all."
1047,"I wish humbugs would leave duty alone. I wish all duty wasn't covered"
1047,"with slime. That's where the real mischief comes in. Passion can always"
1047,"contrive to clothe itself in beauty, strips itself splendid. That"
1047,"carried us. But for all its mean associations there is this duty...."
1047,""
1047,"""Don't we come rather late to it?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Not so late that it won't be atrociously hard to do."""
1047,""
1047,"""It's queer to think of now,"" said Isabel. ""Who could believe we did all"
1047,"we have done honestly? Well, in a manner honestly. Who could believe we"
1047,"thought this might be hidden? Who could trace it all step by step from"
1047,"the time when we found that a certain boldness in our talk was pleasing?"
1047,"We talked of love.... Master, there's not much for us to do in the way"
1047,"of Apologia that any one will credit. And yet if it were possible to"
1047,"tell the very heart of our story...."
1047,""
1047,"""Does Margaret really want to go on with you?"" she asked--""shield"
1047,"you--knowing of... THIS?"""
1047,""
1047,"""I'm certain. I don't understand--just as I don't understand Shoesmith,"
1047,"but she does. These people walk on solid ground which is just thin air"
1047,"to us. They've got something we haven't got. Assurances? I wonder.""..."
1047,""
1047,"Then it was, or later, we talked of Shoesmith, and what her life might"
1047,"be with him."
1047,""
1047,"""He's good,"" she said; ""he's kindly. He's everything but magic. He's the"
1047,"very image of the decent, sober, honourable life. You can't say a thing"
1047,"against him or I--except that something--something in his imagination,"
1047,"something in the tone of his voice--fails for me. Why don't I love"
1047,"him?--he's a better man than you! Why don't you? IS he a better man than"
1047,"you? He's usage, he's honour, he's the right thing, he's the breed and"
1047,"the tradition,--a gentleman. You're your erring, incalculable self. I"
1047,"suppose we women will trust this sort and love your sort to the very end"
1047,"of time...."""
1047,""
1047,"We lay side by side and nibbled at grass stalks as we talked. It seemed"
1047,"enormously unreasonable to us that two people who had come to the pitch"
1047,"of easy and confident affection and happiness that held between us"
1047,"should be obliged to part and shun one another, or murder half the"
1047,"substance of their lives. We felt ourselves crushed and beaten by an"
1047,"indiscriminating machine which destroys happiness in the service of"
1047,"jealousy. ""The mass of people don't feel these things in quite the same"
1047,"manner as we feel them,"" she said. ""Is it because they're different in"
1047,"grain, or educated out of some primitive instinct?"""
1047,""
1047,"""It's because we've explored love a little, and they know no more"
1047,"than the gateway,"" I said. ""Lust and then jealousy; their simple"
1047,"conception--and we have gone past all that and wandered hand in"
1047,"hand...."""
1047,""
1047,"I remember that for a time we watched two of that larger sort of gull,"
1047,"whose wings are brownish-white, circle and hover against the blue. And"
1047,"then we lay and looked at a band of water mirror clear far out to sea,"
1047,"and wondered why the breeze that rippled all the rest should leave it so"
1047,"serene."
1047,""
1047,"""And in this State of ours,"" I resumed."
1047,""
1047,"""Eh!"" said Isabel, rolling over into a sitting posture and looking out"
1047,"at the horizon. ""Let's talk no more of things we can never see. Talk to"
1047,"me of the work you are doing and all we shall do--after we have parted."
1047,"We've said too little of that. We've had our red life, and it's over."
1047,"Thank Heaven!--though we stole it! Talk about your work, dear, and the"
1047,"things we'll go on doing--just as though we were still together. We'll"
1047,"still be together in a sense--through all these things we have in"
1047,"common."""
1047,""
1047,"And so we talked of politics and our outlook. We were interested to the"
1047,"pitch of self-forgetfulness. We weighed persons and forces, discussed"
1047,"the probabilities of the next general election, the steady drift of"
1047,"public opinion in the north and west away from Liberalism towards us."
1047,"It was very manifest that in spite of Wardenham and the EXPURGATOR, we"
1047,"should come into the new Government strongly. The party had no one else,"
1047,"all the young men were formally or informally with us; Esmeer would have"
1047,"office, Lord Tarvrille, I... and very probably there would be something"
1047,"for Shoesmith. ""And for my own part,"" I said, ""I count on backing on the"
1047,"Liberal side. For the last two years we've been forcing competition in"
1047,"constructive legislation between the parties. The Liberals have not been"
1047,"long in following up our Endowment of Motherhood lead. They'll have to"
1047,"give votes and lip service anyhow. Half the readers of the BLUE WEEKLY,"
1047,"they say, are Liberals...."
1047,""
1047,"""I remember talking about things of this sort with old Willersley,"" I"
1047,"said, ""ever so many years ago. It was some place near Locarno, and we"
1047,"looked down the lake that shone weltering--just as now we look over the"
1047,"sea. And then we dreamt in an indistinct featureless way of all that you"
1047,"and I are doing now."""
1047,""
1047,"""I!"" said Isabel, and laughed."
1047,""
1047,"""Well, of some such thing,"" I said, and remained for awhile silent,"
1047,"thinking of Locarno."
1047,""
1047,"I recalled once more the largeness, the release from small personal"
1047,"things that I had felt in my youth; statecraft became real and wonderful"
1047,"again with the memory, the gigantic handling of gigantic problems. I"
1047,"began to talk out my thoughts, sitting up beside her, as I could never"
1047,"talk of them to any one but Isabel; began to recover again the"
1047,"purpose that lay under all my political ambitions and adjustments and"
1047,"anticipations. I saw the State, splendid and wide as I had seen it in"
1047,"that first travel of mine, but now it was no mere distant prospect of"
1047,"spires and pinnacles, but populous with fine-trained, bold-thinking,"
1047,"bold-doing people. It was as if I had forgotten for a long time and now"
1047,"remembered with amazement."
1047,""
1047,"At first, I told her, I had been altogether at a loss how I could do"
1047,"anything to battle against the aimless muddle of our world; I had"
1047,"wanted a clue--until she had come into my life questioning, suggesting,"
1047,"unconsciously illuminating. ""But I have done nothing,"" she protested. I"
1047,"declared she had done everything in growing to education under my eyes,"
1047,"in reflecting again upon all the processes that had made myself, so"
1047,"that instead of abstractions and blue-books and bills and devices, I had"
1047,"realised the world of mankind as a crowd needing before all things fine"
1047,"women and men. We'd spoilt ourselves in learning that, but anyhow we had"
1047,"our lesson. Before her I was in a nineteenth-century darkness, dealing"
1047,"with the nation as if it were a crowd of selfish men, forgetful of women"
1047,"and children and that shy wild thing in the hearts of men, love, which"
1047,"must be drawn upon as it has never been drawn upon before, if the State"
1047,"is to live. I saw now how it is possible to bring the loose factors of a"
1047,"great realm together, to create a mind of literature and thought in it,"
1047,"and the expression of a purpose to make it self-conscious and fine."
1047,"I had it all clear before me, so that at a score of points I could"
1047,"presently begin. The BLUE WEEKLY was a centre of force. Already we had"
1047,"given Imperialism a criticism, and leavened half the press from our"
1047,"columns. Our movement consolidated and spread. We should presently come"
1047,"into power. Everything moved towards our hands. We should be able to get"
1047,"at the schools, the services, the universities, the church; enormously"
1047,"increase the endowment of research, and organise what was sorely wanted,"
1047,"a criticism of research; contrive a closer contact between the press and"
1047,"creative intellectual life; foster literature, clarify, strengthen the"
1047,"public consciousness, develop social organisation and a sense of the"
1047,"State. Men were coming to us every day, brilliant young peers like Lord"
1047,"Dentonhill, writers like Carnot and Cresswell. It filled me with pride"
1047,"to win such men. ""We stand for so much more than we seem to stand for,"""
1047,"I said. I opened my heart to her, so freely that I hesitate to open my"
1047,"heart even to the reader, telling of projects and ambitions I cherished,"
1047,"of my consciousness of great powers and widening opportunities...."
1047,""
1047,"Isabel watched me as I talked."
1047,""
1047,"She too, I think, had forgotten these things for a while. For it is"
1047,"curious and I think a very significant thing that since we had become"
1047,"lovers, we had talked very little of the broader things that had once so"
1047,"strongly gripped our imaginations."
1047,""
1047,"""It's good,"" I said, ""to talk like this to you, to get back to youth and"
1047,"great ambitions with you. There have been times lately when politics has"
1047,"seemed the pettiest game played with mean tools for mean ends--and none"
1047,"the less so that the happiness of three hundred million people might be"
1047,"touched by our follies. I talk to no one else like this.... And now I"
1047,"think of parting, I think but of how much more I might have talked to"

1047,"at the blazing sunset sky behind us. ""Dear, it's been the last day of"
1047,"our lives for us.... It doesn't seem like the last day of our lives. Or"
1047,"any day."""

1047,"It is only now, almost a year after these events, that I can begin to"
1047,"see what happened to me. At the time it seemed to me I was a rational,"
1047,"responsible creature, but indeed I had not parted from her two days"
1047,"before I became a monomaniac to whom nothing could matter but Isabel."
1047,"Every truth had to be squared to that obsession, every duty. It astounds"
1047,"me to think how I forgot Margaret, forgot my work, forgot everything"
1047,"but that we two were parted. I still believe that with better chances"
1047,"we might have escaped the consequences of the emotional storm that"
1047,"presently seized us both. But we had no foresight of that, and no"
1047,"preparation for it, and our circumstances betrayed us. It was partly"
1047,"Shoesmith's unwisdom in delaying his marriage until after the end of the"
1047,"session--partly my own amazing folly in returning within four days to"
1047,"Westminster. But we were all of us intent upon the defeat of scandal"
1047,"and the complete restoration of appearances. It seemed necessary that"
1047,"Shoesmith's marriage should not seem to be hurried, still more necessary"
1047,"that I should not vanish inexplicably. I had to be visible with Margaret"
1047,"in London just as much as possible; we went to restaurants, we visited"
1047,"the theatre; we could even contemplate the possibility of my presence at"
1047,"the wedding. For that, however, we had schemed a weekend visit to Wales,"
1047,"and a fictitious sprained ankle at the last moment which would justify"
1047,"my absence...."
1047,""
1047,"I cannot convey to you the intolerable wretchedness and rebellion of"
1047,"my separation from Isabel. It seemed that in the past two years all"
1047,"my thoughts had spun commisures to Isabel's brain and I could think of"
1047,"nothing that did not lead me surely to the need of the one intimate I"
1047,"had found in the world. I came back to the House and the office and my"
1047,"home, I filled all my days with appointments and duty, and it did not"
1047,"save me in the least from a lonely emptiness such as I had never felt"
1047,"before in all my life. I had little sleep. In the daytime I did a"
1047,"hundred things, I even spoke in the House on two occasions, and by my"
1047,"own low standards spoke well, and it seemed to me that I was going about"
1047,"in my own brain like a hushed survivor in a house whose owner lies dead"
1047,"upstairs."
1047,""
1047,"I came to a crisis after that wild dinner of Tarvrille's. Something in"
1047,"that stripped my soul bare."
1047,""
1047,"It was an occasion made absurd and strange by the odd accident that the"
1047,"house caught fire upstairs while we were dining below. It was a men's"
1047,"dinner--""A dinner of all sorts,"" said Tarvrille, when he invited me;"
1047,"""everything from Evesham and Gane to Wilkins the author, and Heaven"
1047,"knows what will happen!"" I remember that afterwards Tarvrille was"
1047,"accused of having planned the fire to make his dinner a marvel and a"
1047,"memory. It was indeed a wonderful occasion, and I suppose if I had not"
1047,"been altogether drenched in misery, I should have found the same wild"
1047,"amusement in it that glowed in all the others. There were one or two"
1047,"university dons, Lord George Fester, the racing man, Panmure, the"
1047,"artist, two or three big City men, Weston Massinghay and another"
1047,"prominent Liberal whose name I can't remember, the three men Tarvrille"
1047,"had promised and Esmeer, Lord Wrassleton, Waulsort, the member for"
1047,"Monckton, Neal and several others. We began a little coldly, with"
1047,"duologues, but the conversation was already becoming general--so far as"
1047,"such a long table permitted--when the fire asserted itself."
1047,""
1047,"It asserted itself first as a penetrating and emphatic smell of burning"
1047,"rubber,--it was caused by the fusing of an electric wire. The reek"
1047,"forced its way into the discussion of the Pekin massacres that had"
1047,"sprung up between Evesham, Waulsort, and the others at the end of the"
1047,"table. ""Something burning,"" said the man next to me."
1047,""
1047,"""Something must be burning,"" said Panmure."
1047,""
1047,"Tarvrille hated undignified interruptions. He had a particularly"
1047,"imperturbable butler with a cadaverous sad face and an eye of rigid"
1047,"disapproval. He spoke to this individual over his shoulder. ""Just see,"
1047,"will you,"" he said, and caught up the pause in the talk to his left."
1047,""
1047,"Wilkins was asking questions, and I, too, was curious. The story of the"
1047,"siege of the Legations in China in the year 1900 and all that followed"
1047,"upon that, is just one of those disturbing interludes in history that"
1047,"refuse to join on to that general scheme of protestation by which"
1047,"civilisation is maintained. It is a break in the general flow of"
1047,"experience as disconcerting to statecraft as the robbery of my knife and"
1047,"the scuffle that followed it had been to me when I was a boy at Penge."
1047,"It is like a tear in a curtain revealing quite unexpected backgrounds. I"
1047,"had never given the business a thought for years; now this talk brought"
1047,"back a string of pictures to my mind; how the reliefs arrived and the"
1047,"plundering began, how section after section of the International Army"
1047,"was drawn into murder and pillage, how the infection spread upward"
1047,"until the wives of Ministers were busy looting, and the very sentinels"
1047,"stripped and crawled like snakes into the Palace they were set to guard."
1047,"It did not stop at robbery, men were murdered, women, being plundered,"
1047,"were outraged, children were butchered, strong men had found themselves"
1047,"with arms in a lawless, defenceless city, and this had followed. Now it"
1047,"was all recalled."
1047,""
1047,"""Respectable ladies addicted to district visiting at home were as bad as"
1047,"any one,"" said Panmure. ""Glazebrook told me of one--flushed like a woman"
1047,"at a bargain sale, he said--and when he pointed out to her that the silk"
1047,"she'd got was bloodstained, she just said, 'Oh, bother!' and threw it"
1047,"aside and went back...."""
1047,""
1047,"We became aware that Tarvrille's butler had returned. We tried not to"
1047,"seem to listen."
1047,""
1047,"""Beg pardon, m'lord,"" he said. ""The house IS on fire, m'lord."""
1047,""
1047,"""Upstairs, m'lord."""
1047,""
1047,"""Just overhead, m'lord."""
1047,""
1047,"""The maids are throwing water, m'lord, and I've telephoned FIRE."""
1047,""
1047,"""No, m'lord, no immediate danger."""
1047,""
1047,"""It's all right,"" said Tarvrille to the table generally. ""Go on! It's"
1047,"not a general conflagration, and the fire brigade won't be five minutes."
1047,"Don't see that it's our affair. The stuff's insured. They say old Lady"
1047,"Paskershortly was dreadful. Like a harpy. The Dowager Empress had shown"
1047,"her some little things of hers. Pet things--hidden away. Susan went"
1047,"straight for them--used to take an umbrella for the silks. Born"
1047,"shoplifter."""
1047,""
1047,"It was evident he didn't want his dinner spoilt, and we played up"
1047,"loyally."
1047,""
1047,"""This is recorded history,"" said Wilkins,--""practically. It makes one"
1047,"wonder about unrecorded history. In India, for example."""
1047,""
1047,"But nobody touched that."
1047,""
1047,"""Thompson,"" said Tarvrille to the imperturbable butler, and indicating"
1047,"the table generally, ""champagne. Champagne. Keep it going."""
1047,""
1047,"""M'lord,"" and Thompson marshalled his assistants."
1047,""
1047,"Some man I didn't know began to remember things about Mandalay. ""It's"
1047,"queer,"" he said, ""how people break out at times;"" and told his story"
1047,"of an army doctor, brave, public-spirited, and, as it happened,"
1047,"deeply religious, who was caught one evening by the excitement of"
1047,"plundering--and stole and hid, twisted the wrist of a boy until it"
1047,"broke, and was afterwards overcome by wild remorse."
1047,""
1047,"I watched Evesham listening intently. ""Strange,"" he said, ""very strange."
1047,"We are such stuff as thieves are made of. And in China, too, they"
1047,"murdered people--for the sake of murdering. Apart, so to speak, from"
1047,"mercenary considerations. I'm afraid there's no doubt of it in certain"
1047,"cases. No doubt at all. Young soldiers fresh from German high schools"
1047,"and English homes!"""
1047,""
1047,"""Did OUR people?"" asked some patriot."
1047,""
1047,"""Not so much. But I'm afraid there were cases.... Some of the Indian"
1047,"troops were pretty bad."""
1047,""
1047,"Gane picked up the tale with confirmations."
1047,""
1047,"It is all printed in the vividest way as a picture upon my memory, so"
1047,"that were I a painter I think I could give the deep rich browns and warm"
1047,"greys beyond the brightly lit table, the various distinguished faces,"
1047,"strongly illuminated, interested and keen, above the black and white of"
1047,"evening dress, the alert menservants with their heavier, clean-shaved"
1047,"faces indistinctly seen in the dimness behind. Then this was coloured"
1047,"emotionally for me by my aching sense of loss and sacrifice, and by"
1047,"the chance trend of our talk to the breaches and unrealities of the"
1047,"civilised scheme. We seemed a little transitory circle of light in a"
1047,"universe of darkness and violence; an effect to which the diminishing"
1047,"smell of burning rubber, the trampling of feet overhead, the swish"
1047,"of water, added enormously. Everybody--unless, perhaps, it was"
1047,"Evesham--drank rather carelessly because of the suppressed excitement of"
1047,"our situation, and talked the louder and more freely."
1047,""
1047,"""But what a flimsy thing our civilisation is!"" said Evesham; ""a mere"
1047,"thin net of habits and associations!"""
1047,""
1047,"""I suppose those men came back,"" said Wilkins."
1047,""
1047,"""Lady Paskershortly did!"" chuckled Evesham."
1047,""
1047,"""How do they fit it in with the rest of their lives?"" Wilkins"
1047,"speculated. ""I suppose there's Pekin-stained police officers,"
1047,"Pekin-stained J. P.'s--trying petty pilferers in the severest"
1047,"manner.""..."
1047,""
1047,"Then for a time things became preposterous. There was a sudden cascade"
1047,"of water by the fireplace, and then absurdly the ceiling began to rain"
1047,"upon us, first at this point and then that. ""My new suit!"" cried some"
1047,"one. ""Perrrrrr-up pe-rr""--a new vertical line of blackened water would"
1047,"establish itself and form a spreading pool upon the gleaming cloth. The"
1047,"men nearest would arrange catchment areas of plates and flower bowls."
1047,"""Draw up!"" said Tarvrille, ""draw up. That's the bad end of the table!"""
1047,"He turned to the imperturbable butler. ""Take round bath towels,"" he"
1047,"said; and presently the men behind us were offering--with inflexible"
1047,"dignity--""Port wine, Sir. Bath towel, Sir!"" Waulsort, with streaks of"
1047,"blackened water on his forehead, was suddenly reminded of a wet year"
1047,"when he had followed the French army manoeuvres. An animated dispute"
1047,"sprang up between him and Neal about the relative efficiency of the new"
1047,"French and German field guns. Wrassleton joined in and a little drunken"
1047,"shrivelled Oxford don of some sort with a black-splashed shirt front who"
1047,"presently silenced them all by the immensity and particularity of his"
1047,"knowledge of field artillery. Then the talk drifted to Sedan and the"
1047,"effect of dead horses upon drinking-water, which brought Wrassleton"
1047,"and Weston Massinghay into a dispute of great vigour and emphasis. ""The"
1047,"trouble in South Africa,"" said Weston Massinghay, ""wasn't that we didn't"
1047,"boil our water. It was that we didn't boil our men. The Boers drank the"
1047,"same stuff we did. THEY didn't get dysentery."""
1047,""
1047,"That argument went on for some time. I was attacked across the table by"
1047,"a man named Burshort about my Endowment of Motherhood schemes, but"
1047,"in the gaps of that debate I could still hear Weston Massinghay"
1047,"at intervals repeat in a rather thickened voice: ""THEY didn't get"
1047,"dysentery."""
1047,""
1047,"I think Evesham went early. The rest of us clustered more and more"
1047,"closely towards the drier end of the room, the table was pushed along,"
1047,"and the area beneath the extinguished conflagration abandoned to a"
1047,"tinkling, splashing company of pots and pans and bowls and baths."
1047,"Everybody was now disposed to be hilarious and noisy, to say startling"
1047,"and aggressive things; we must have sounded a queer clamour to a"
1047,"listener in the next room. The devil inspired them to begin baiting me."
1047,"""Ours isn't the Tory party any more,"" said Burshort. ""Remington has made"
1047,"it the Obstetric Party."""
1047,""
1047,"""That's good!"" said Weston Massinghay, with all his teeth gleaming; ""I"
1047,"shall use that against you in the House!"""
1047,""
1047,"""I shall denounce you for abusing private confidences if you do,"" said"
1047,"Tarvrille."
1047,""
1047,"""Remington wants us to give up launching Dreadnoughts and launch babies"
1047,"instead,"" Burshort urged. ""For the price of one Dreadnought--"""
1047,""
1047,"The little shrivelled don who had been omniscient about guns joined in"
1047,"the baiting, and displayed himself a venomous creature. Something in"
1047,"his eyes told me he knew Isabel and hated me for it. ""Love and fine"
1047,"thinking,"" he began, a little thickly, and knocking over a wine-glass"
1047,"with a too easy gesture. ""Love and fine thinking. Two things don't go"
1047,"together. No philosophy worth a damn ever came out of excesses of love."
1047,"Salt Lake City--Piggott--Ag--Agapemone again--no works to matter."""
1047,""
1047,"Everybody laughed."
1047,""
1047,"""Got to rec'nise these facts,"" said my assailant. ""Love and fine think'n"
1047,"pretty phrase--attractive. Suitable for p'litical dec'rations. Postcard,"
1047,"Christmas, gilt lets, in a wreath of white flow's. Not oth'wise"
1047,"valu'ble."""
1047,""
1047,"I made some remark, I forget what, but he overbore me."
1047,""
1047,"Real things we want are Hate--Hate and COARSE think'n. I b'long to the"
1047,"school of Mrs. F's Aunt--"""
1047,""
1047,"""What?"" said some one, intent."
1047,""
1047,"""In 'Little Dorrit,'"" explained Tarvrille; ""go on!"""
1047,""
1047,"""Hate a fool,"" said my assailant."
1047,""
1047,"Tarvrille glanced at me. I smiled to conceal the loss of my temper."
1047,""
1047,"""Hate,"" said the little man, emphasising his point with a clumsy fist."
1047,"""Hate's the driving force. What's m'rality?--hate of rotten goings"
1047,"on. What's patriotism?--hate of int'loping foreigners. What's"
1047,"Radicalism?--hate of lords. What's Toryism?--hate of disturbance. It's"
1047,"all hate--hate from top to bottom. Hate of a mess. Remington owned it"
1047,"the other day, said he hated a mu'll. There you are! If you couldn't"
1047,"get hate into an election, damn it (hic) people wou'n't poll. Poll for"
1047,"love!--no' me!"""
1047,""
1047,"He paused, but before any one could speak he had resumed."
1047,""
1047,"""Then this about fine thinking. Like going into a bear pit armed with a"
1047,"tagle--talgent--talgent galv'nometer. Like going to fight a mad dog with"
1047,"Shasepear and the Bible. Fine thinking--what we want is the thickes'"
1047,"thinking we can get. Thinking that stands up alone. Taf Reform means"
1047,"work for all, thassort of thing."""
1047,""
1047,"The gentleman from Cambridge paused. ""YOU a flag!"" he said. ""I'd as soon"
1047,"go to ba'ell und' wet tissue paper!"""
1047,""
1047,"My best answer on the spur of the moment was:"
1047,""
1047,"""The Japanese did."" Which was absurd."
1047,""
1047,"I went on to some other reply, I forget exactly what, and the talk of"
1047,"the whole table drew round me. It was an extraordinary revelation to me."
1047,"Every one was unusually careless and outspoken, and it was amazing how"
1047,"manifestly they echoed the feeling of this old Tory spokesman. They were"
1047,"quite friendly to me, they regarded me and the BLUE WEEKLY as valuable"
1047,"party assets for Toryism, but it was clear they attached no more"
1047,"importance to what were my realities than they did to the remarkable"
1047,"therapeutic claims of Mrs. Eddy. They were flushed and amused, perhaps"
1047,"they went a little too far in their resolves to draw me, but they left"
1047,"the impression on my mind of men irrevocably set upon narrow and cynical"
1047,"views of political life. For them the political struggle was a game,"
1047,"whose counters were human hate and human credulity; their real aim was"
1047,"just every one's aim, the preservation of the class and way of living to"
1047,"which their lives were attuned. They did not know how tired I was, how"
1047,"exhausted mentally and morally, nor how cruel their convergent attack"
1047,"on me chanced to be. But my temper gave way, I became tart and fierce,"
1047,"perhaps my replies were a trifle absurd, and Tarvrille, with that quick"
1047,"eye and sympathy of his, came to the rescue. Then for a time I sat"
1047,"silent and drank port wine while the others talked. The disorder of"
1047,"the room, the still dripping ceiling, the noise, the displaced ties and"
1047,"crumpled shirts of my companions, jarred on my tormented nerves...."
1047,""
1047,"It was long past midnight when we dispersed. I remember Tarvrille coming"
1047,"with me into the hall, and then suggesting we should go upstairs to see"
1047,"the damage. A manservant carried up two flickering candles for us."
1047,"One end of the room was gutted, curtains, hangings, several chairs and"
1047,"tables were completely burnt, the panelling was scorched and warped,"
1047,"three smashed windows made the candles flare and gutter, and some scraps"
1047,"of broken china still lay on the puddled floor."
1047,""
1047,"As we surveyed this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party,"
1047,"a slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes"
1047,"beneath her golden hair. I remember how stupidly we laughed at her"
1047,"surprise."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"2"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I parted from Panmure at the corner of Aldington Street, and went my way"
1047,"alone. But I did not go home, I turned westward and walked for a long"
1047,"way, and then struck northward aimlessly. I was too miserable to go to"
1047,"my house."
1047,""
1047,"I wandered about that night like a man who has discovered his Gods"
1047,"are dead. I can look back now detached yet sympathetic upon that wild"
1047,"confusion of moods and impulses, and by it I think I can understand, oh!"
1047,"half the wrongdoing and blundering in the world."
1047,""
1047,"I do not feel now the logical force of the process that must have"
1047,"convinced me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength in"
1047,"vain. At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory party had"
1047,"higher ideals than any other party, yet it came to me like a thing newly"
1047,"discovered that the men I had to work with had for the most part no such"
1047,"dreams, no sense of any collective purpose, no atom of the faith I held."
1047,"They were just as immediately intent upon personal ends, just as limited"
1047,"by habits of thought, as the men in any other group or party. Perhaps I"
1047,"had slipped unawares for a time into the delusions of a party man--but I"
1047,"do not think so."
1047,""
1047,"No, it was the mood of profound despondency that had followed upon the"
1047,"abrupt cessation of my familiar intercourse with Isabel, that gave this"
1047,"fact that had always been present in my mind its quality of devastating"
1047,"revelation. It seemed as though I had never seen before nor suspected"
1047,"the stupendous gap between the chaotic aims, the routine, the"
1047,"conventional acquiescences, the vulgarisations of the personal life, and"
1047,"that clearly conscious development and service of a collective thought"
1047,"and purpose at which my efforts aimed. I had thought them but a little"
1047,"way apart, and now I saw they were separated by all the distance"
1047,"between earth and heaven. I saw now in myself and every one around me,"
1047,"a concentration upon interests close at hand, an inability to detach"
1047,"oneself from the provocations, tendernesses, instinctive hates, dumb"
1047,"lusts and shy timidities that touched one at every point; and, save"
1047,"for rare exalted moments, a regardlessness of broader aims and remoter"
1047,"possibilities that made the white passion of statecraft seem as"
1047,"unearthly and irrelevant to human life as the story an astronomer will"
1047,"tell, half proven but altogether incredible, of habitable planets and"
1047,"answering intelligences, suns' distances uncounted across the deep. It"
1047,"seemed to me I had aspired too high and thought too far, had mocked my"
1047,"own littleness by presumption, had given the uttermost dear reality of"
1047,"life for a theoriser's dream."
1047,""
1047,"All through that wandering agony of mine that night a dozen threads of"
1047,"thought interwove; now I was a soul speaking in protest to God against"
1047,"a task too cold and high for it, and now I was an angry man, scorned and"
1047,"pointed upon, who had let life cheat him of the ultimate pride of his"
1047,"soul. Now I was the fool of ambition, who opened his box of gold to find"
1047,"blank emptiness, and now I was a spinner of flimsy thoughts, whose web"
1047,"tore to rags at a touch. I realised for the first time how much I had"
1047,"come to depend upon the mind and faith of Isabel, how she had confirmed"
1047,"me and sustained me, how little strength I had to go on with our"
1047,"purposes now that she had vanished from my life. She had been the"
1047,"incarnation of those great abstractions, the saving reality, the voice"
1047,"that answered back. There was no support that night in the things that"
1047,"had been. We were alone together on the cliff for ever more!--that was"
1047,"very pretty in its way, but it had no truth whatever that could help"
1047,"me now, no ounce of sustaining value. I wanted Isabel that night, no"
1047,"sentiment or memory of her, but Isabel alive,--to talk to me, to touch"
1047,"me, to hold me together. I wanted unendurably the dusky gentleness of"
1047,"her presence, the consolation of her voice."
1047,""
1047,"We were alone together on the cliff! I startled a passing cabman into"
1047,"interest by laughing aloud at that magnificent and characteristic"
1047,"sentimentality. What a lie it was, and how satisfying it had been! That"
1047,"was just where we shouldn't remain. We of all people had no distinction"
1047,"from that humanity whose lot is to forget. We should go out to other"
1047,"interests, new experiences, new demands. That tall and intricate fabric"
1047,"of ambitious understandings we had built up together in our intimacy"
1047,"would be the first to go; and last perhaps to endure with us would be"
1047,"a few gross memories of sights and sounds, and trivial incidental"
1047,"excitements...."
1047,""
1047,"I had a curious feeling that night that I had lost touch with life for"
1047,"a long time, and had now been reminded of its quality. That infernal"
1047,"little don's parody of my ruling phrase, ""Hate and coarse thinking,"""
1047,"stuck in my thoughts like a poisoned dart, a centre of inflammation."
1047,"Just as a man who is debilitated has no longer the vitality to resist"
1047,"an infection, so my mind, slackened by the crisis of my separation from"
1047,"Isabel, could find no resistance to his emphatic suggestion. It seemed"
1047,"to me that what he had said was overpoweringly true, not only of"
1047,"contemporary life, but of all possible human life. Love is the rare"
1047,"thing, the treasured thing; you lock it away jealously and watch, and"
1047,"well you may; hate and aggression and force keep the streets and rule"
1047,"the world. And fine thinking is, in the rough issues of life, weak"
1047,"thinking, is a balancing indecisive process, discovers with disloyal"
1047,"impartiality a justice and a defect on each disputing side. ""Good honest"
1047,"men,"" as Dayton calls them, rule the world, with a way of thinking"
1047,"out decisions like shooting cartloads of bricks, and with a steadfast"
1047,"pleasure in hostility. Dayton liked to call his antagonists ""blaggards"
1047,"and scoundrels""--it justified his opposition--the Lords were"
1047,"""scoundrels,"" all people richer than he were ""scoundrels,"" all"
1047,"Socialists, all troublesome poor people; he liked to think of jails and"
1047,"justice being done. His public spirit was saturated with the sombre"
1047,"joys of conflict and the pleasant thought of condign punishment for"
1047,"all recalcitrant souls. That was the way of it, I perceived. That had"
1047,"survival value, as the biologists say. He was fool enough in politics to"
1047,"be a consistent and happy politician...."
1047,""
1047,"Hate and coarse thinking; how the infernal truth of the phrase beat me"
1047,"down that night! I couldn't remember that I had known this all along,"
1047,"and that it did not really matter in the slightest degree. I had worked"
1047,"it all out long ago in other terms, when I had seen how all parties"
1047,"stood for interests inevitably, and how the purpose in life achieves"
1047,"itself, if it achieves itself at all, as a bye product of the war"
1047,"of individuals and classes. Hadn't I always known that science and"
1047,"philosophy elaborate themselves in spite of all the passion and"
1047,"narrowness of men, in spite of the vanities and weakness of their"
1047,"servants, in spite of all the heated disorder of contemporary things?"
1047,"Wasn't it my own phrase to speak of ""that greater mind in men, in which"
1047,"we are but moments and transitorily lit cells?"" Hadn't I known that the"
1047,"spirit of man still speaks like a thing that struggles out of mud and"
1047,"slime, and that the mere effort to speak means choking and disaster?"
1047,"Hadn't I known that we who think without fear and speak without"
1047,"discretion will not come to our own for the next two thousand years?"
1047,""
1047,"It was the last was most forgotten of all that faith mislaid. Before"
1047,"mankind, in my vision that night, stretched new centuries of confusion,"
1047,"vast stupid wars, hastily conceived laws, foolish temporary triumphs"
1047,"of order, lapses, set-backs, despairs, catastrophes, new beginnings, a"
1047,"multitudinous wilderness of time, a nigh plotless drama of wrong-headed"
1047,"energies. In order to assuage my parting from Isabel we had set"
1047,"ourselves to imagine great rewards for our separation, great personal"
1047,"rewards; we had promised ourselves success visible and shining in our"
1047,"lives. To console ourselves in our separation we had made out of"
1047,"the BLUE WEEKLY and our young Tory movement preposterously enormous"
1047,"things-as though those poor fertilising touches at the soil were indeed"
1047,"the germinating seeds of the millennium, as though a million lives such"
1047,"as ours had not to contribute before the beginning of the beginning."
1047,"That poor pretence had failed. That magnificent proposition shrivelled"
1047,"to nothing in the black loneliness of that night."
1047,""
1047,"I saw that there were to be no such compensations. So far as my real"
1047,"services to mankind were concerned I had to live an unrecognised"
1047,"and unrewarded life. If I made successes it would be by the way. Our"
1047,"separation would alter nothing of that. My scandal would cling to me"
1047,"now for all my life, a thing affecting relationships, embarrassing and"
1047,"hampering my spirit. I should follow the common lot of those who live by"
1047,"the imagination, and follow it now in infinite loneliness of soul; the"
1047,"one good comforter, the one effectual familiar, was lost to me for"
1047,"ever; I should do good and evil together, no one caring to understand;"
1047,"I should produce much weary work, much bad-spirited work, much absolute"
1047,"evil; the good in me would be too often ill-expressed and missed or"
1047,"misinterpreted. In the end I might leave one gleaming flake or so amidst"
1047,"the slag heaps for a moment of postmortem sympathy. I was afraid beyond"
1047,"measure of my derelict self. Because I believed with all my soul in love"
1047,"and fine thinking that did not mean that I should necessarily either"
1047,"love steadfastly or think finely. I remember how I fell talking to"
1047,"God--I think I talked out loud. ""Why do I care for these things?"""
1047,"I cried, ""when I can do so little! Why am I apart from the jolly"
1047,"thoughtless fighting life of men? These dreams fade to nothingness, and"
1047,"leave me bare!"""
1047,""
1047,"I scolded. ""Why don't you speak to a man, show yourself? I thought I"
1047,"had a gleam of you in Isabel,--and then you take her away. Do you really"
1047,"think I can carry on this game alone, doing your work in darkness and"
1047,"silence, living in muddled conflict, half living, half dying?"""
1047,""
1047,"Grotesque analogies arose in my mind. I discovered a strange parallelism"
1047,"between my now tattered phrase of ""Love and fine thinking"" and the"
1047,"""Love and the Word"" of Christian thought. Was it possible the Christian"
1047,"propaganda had at the outset meant just that system of attitudes I had"
1047,"been feeling my way towards from the very beginning of my life? Had"
1047,"I spent a lifetime making my way back to Christ? It mocks humanity"
1047,"to think how Christ has been overlaid. I went along now, recalling"
1047,"long-neglected phrases and sentences; I had a new vision of that great"
1047,"central figure preaching love with hate and coarse thinking even in the"
1047,"disciples about Him, rising to a tidal wave at last in that clamour for"
1047,"Barabbas, and the public satisfaction in His fate...."
1047,""
1047,"It's curious to think that hopeless love and a noisy disordered dinner"
1047,"should lead a man to these speculations, but they did. ""He DID mean"
1047,"that!"" I said, and suddenly thought of what a bludgeon they'd made"
1047,"of His Christianity. Athwart that perplexing, patient enigma sitting"
1047,"inaudibly among publicans and sinners, danced and gibbered a long"
1047,"procession of the champions of orthodoxy. ""He wasn't human,"" I said,"
1047,"and remembered that last despairing cry, ""My God! My God! why hast Thou"
1047,"forsaken Me?"""
1047,""
1047,"""Oh, HE forsakes every one,"" I said, flying out as a tired mind will,"
1047,"with an obvious repartee...."
1047,""
1047,"I passed at a bound from such monstrous theology to a towering rage"
1047,"against the Baileys. In an instant and with no sense of absurdity I"
1047,"wanted--in the intervals of love and fine thinking--to fling about that"
1047,"strenuously virtuous couple; I wanted to kick Keyhole of the PEEPSHOW"
1047,"into the gutter and make a common massacre of all the prosperous"
1047,"rascaldom that makes a trade and rule of virtue. I can still feel that"
1047,"transition. In a moment I had reached that phase of weakly decisive"
1047,"anger which is for people of my temperament the concomitant of"
1047,"exhaustion."
1047,""
1047,"""I will have her,"" I cried. ""By Heaven! I WILL have her! Life mocks me"
1047,"and cheats me. Nothing can be made good to me again.... Why shouldn't I"
1047,"save what I can? I can't save myself without her...."""
1047,""
1047,"I remember myself--as a sort of anti-climax to that--rather tediously"
1047,"asking my way home. I was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Holland"
1047,"Park...."
1047,""
1047,"It was then between one and two. I felt that I could go home now without"
1047,"any risk of meeting Margaret. It had been the thought of returning to"
1047,"Margaret that had sent me wandering that night. It is one of the ugliest"
1047,"facts I recall about that time of crisis, the intense aversion I felt"
1047,"for Margaret. No sense of her goodness, her injury and nobility, and"
1047,"the enormous generosity of her forgiveness, sufficed to mitigate that."
1047,"I hope now that in this book I am able to give something of her silvery"
1047,"splendour, but all through this crisis I felt nothing of that. There was"
1047,"a triumphant kindliness about her that I found intolerable. She meant to"
1047,"be so kind to me, to offer unstinted consolation, to meet my needs, to"
1047,"supply just all she imagined Isabel had given me."
1047,""
1047,"When I left Tarvrille's, I felt I could anticipate exactly how she would"
1047,"meet my homecoming. She would be perplexed by my crumpled shirt front,"
1047,"on which I had spilt some drops of wine; she would overlook that by an"
1047,"effort, explain it sentimentally, resolve it should make no difference"
1047,"to her. She would want to know who had been present, what we had talked"
1047,"about, show the alertest interest in whatever it was--it didn't matter"
1047,"what.... No, I couldn't face her."
1047,""
1047,"So I did not reach my study until two o'clock."
1047,""
1047,"There, I remember, stood the new and very beautiful old silver"
1047,"candlesticks that she had set there two days since to please me--the"
1047,"foolish kindliness of it! But in her search for expression, Margaret"
1047,"heaped presents upon me. She had fitted these candlesticks with electric"
1047,"lights, and I must, I suppose, have lit them to write my note to Isabel."
1047,"""Give me a word--the world aches without you,"" was all I scrawled,"
1047,"though I fully meant that she should come to me. I knew, though I ought"
1047,"not to have known, that now she had left her flat, she was with the"
1047,"Balfes--she was to have been married from the Balfes--and I sent my"
1047,"letter there. And I went out into the silent square and posted the note"
1047,"forthwith, because I knew quite clearly that if I left it until morning"
1047,"I should never post it at all."
1047,""
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"3"
1047,""
1047,""
1047,"I had a curious revulsion of feeling that morning of our meeting. (Of"
1047,"all places for such a clandestine encounter she had chosen the bridge"
1047,"opposite Buckingham Palace.) Overnight I had been full of self pity, and"
1047,"eager for the comfort of Isabel's presence. But the ill-written scrawl"
1047,"in which she had replied had been full of the suggestion of her own"
1047,"weakness and misery. And when I saw her, my own selfish sorrows were"
1047,"altogether swept away by a wave of pitiful tenderness. Something had"
1047,"happened to her that I did not understand. She was manifestly ill. She"
1047,"came towards me wearily, she who had always borne herself so bravely;"
1047,"her shoulders seemed bent, and her eyes were tired, and her face white"
1047,"and drawn. All my life has been a narrow self-centred life; no brothers,"
1047,"no sisters or children or weak things had ever yet made any intimate"
1047,"appeal to me, and suddenly--I verily believe for the first time in my"
1047,"life!--I felt a great passion of protective ownership; I felt that here"
1047,"was something that I could die to shelter, something that meant more"
1047,"than joy or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid creation to me, a"
1047,"new kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world. Some sealed fountain"
1047,"was opened in my breast. I knew that I could love Isabel broken, Isabel"
1047,"beaten, Isabel ugly and in pain, more than I could love any sweet"
1047,"or delightful or glorious thing in life. I didn't care any more for"
1047,"anything in the world but Isabel, and that I should protect her. I"
1047,"trembled as I came near her, and could scarcely speak to her for the"
1047,"emotion that filled me...."

1047,"I remember my lame sentences. ""We'll have a boat. That's best here."""
1047,""
1047,"I took her to the little boat-house, and there we hired a boat, and"
1047,"I rowed in silence under the bridge and into the shade of a tree. The"
1047,"square grey stone masses of the Foreign Office loomed through the twigs,"
1047,"I remember, and a little space of grass separated us from the pathway"

1047,"You say--what do you say? It's loss of so much life to lose each other."
1047,"So is losing a hand or a leg. But it's what you've incurred. Amputate."
1047,"Take your punishment--After all, you chose it."""
1047,""
1047,"""Oh, damn!"" I said, standing up and going to the window."

1047,"I turned upon him with a snarl in my voice. ""My dear Britten!"" I cried."
1047,"""Don't I KNOW I'm doing wrong? Aren't I in a net? Suppose I don't go!"
1047,"Is there any right in that? Do you think we're going to be much to"
1047,"ourselves or any one after this parting? I've been thinking all"
1047,"last night of this business, trying it over and over again from the"
1047,"beginning. How was it we went wrong? Since I came back from America--I"
1047,"grant you THAT--but SINCE, there's never been a step that wasn't forced,"
1047,"that hadn't as much right in it or more, as wrong. You talk as though I"
1047,"was a thing of steel that could bend this way or that and never change."
1047,"You talk as though Isabel was a cat one could give to any kind of"
1047,"owner.... We two are things that change and grow and alter all the time."
1047,"We're--so interwoven that being parted now will leave us just misshapen"
1047,"cripples.... You don't know the motives, you don't know the rush and"
1047,"feel of things, you don't know how it was with us, and how it is with"
1047,"us. You don't know the hunger for the mere sight of one another; you"
1047,"don't know anything."""
1047,""
1047,"Britten looked at his finger-nails closely. His red face puckered to"
1047,"a wry frown. ""Haven't we all at times wanted the world put back?"" he"
1047,"grunted, and looked hard and close at one particular nail."
1047,""
1047,"There was a long pause."
1047,""
1047,"""I want her,"" I said, ""and I'm going to have her. I'm too tired for"
1047,"balancing the right or wrong of it any more. You can't separate them."

1047,"just outside the door waiting for us."""

1047,"""There isn't,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""If there was?"""

1047,"I made no answer."
1047,""

1047,"""No end of things."""
1047,""
1047,"""Nothing."""

1047,"""I don't believe you are right,"" I said. ""I believe we can save"
1047,"something--"""
1047,""
1047,"Britten shook his head. ""Some scraps of salvage won't excuse you,"" he"
1047,"said."
1047,""
1047,"His indignation rose. ""In the middle of life!"" he said. ""No man has a"
1047,"right to take his hand from the plough!"""
1047,""
1047,"He leant forward on his desk and opened an argumentative palm. ""You"

1047,"for six months--if you could be clapped in prison, or got out of the way"
1047,"somehow,--until this marriage was all over and settled down for a year,"
1047,"say--you know then you two could meet, curious, happy, as friends."
1047,"Saved! You KNOW it."""

1047,"""I am certain of one thing, Britten. It is our duty not to hush up this"
1047,"scandal."""

1047,"He raised his eyebrows. I perceived now the element of absurdity in me,"
1047,"but at the time I was as serious as a man who is burning."
1047,""
1047,"""It's our duty,"" I went on, ""to smash now openly in the sight of every"
1047,"one. Yes! I've got that as clean and plain--as prison whitewash. I am"
1047,"convinced that we have got to be public to the uttermost now--I mean"
1047,"it--until every corner of our world knows this story, knows it fully,"
1047,"adds it to the Parnell story and the Ashton Dean story and the Carmel"
1047,"story and the Witterslea story, and all the other stories that have"
1047,"picked man after man out of English public life, the men with active"
1047,"imaginations, the men of strong initiative. To think this tottering"
1047,"old-woman ridden Empire should dare to waste a man on such a score! You"
1047,"say I ought to be penitent--"""
1047,""
1047,"Britten shook his head and smiled very faintly."
1047,""
1047,"""I'm boiling with indignation,"" I said. ""I lay in bed last night and"
1047,"went through it all. What in God's name was to be expected of us but"
1047,"what has happened? I went through my life bit by bit last night, I"
1047,"recalled all I've had to do with virtue and women, and all I was told"
1047,"and how I was prepared. I was born into cowardice and debasement. We all"
1047,"are. Our generation's grimy with hypocrisy. I came to the most beautiful"
1047,"things in life--like peeping Tom of Coventry. I was never given a light,"
1047,"never given a touch of natural manhood by all this dingy, furtive,"
1047,"canting, humbugging English world. Thank God! I'll soon be out of it!"
1047,"The shame of it! The very savages in Australia initiate their children"
1047,"better than the English do to-day. Neither of us was ever given a"
1047,"view of what they call morality that didn't make it show as shabby"
1047,"subservience, as the meanest discretion, an abject submission to"
1047,"unreasonable prohibitions! meek surrender of mind and body to the"
1047,"dictation of pedants and old women and fools. We weren't taught--we"
1047,"were mumbled at! And when we found that the thing they called unclean,"
1047,"unclean, was Pagan beauty--God! it was a glory to sin, Britten, it was a"
1047,"pride and splendour like bathing in the sunlight after dust and grime!"""
1047,""
1047,"""Yes,"" said Britten. ""That's all very well--"""
1047,""
1047,"I interrupted him. ""I know there's a case--I'm beginning to think it a"
1047,"valid case against us; but we never met it! There's a steely pride in"
1047,"self restraint, a nobility of chastity, but only for those who see and"
1047,"think and act--untrammeled and unafraid. The other thing, the current"
1047,"thing, why! it's worth as much as the chastity of a monkey kept in a"
1047,"cage by itself!"" I put my foot in a chair, and urged my case upon him."
1047,"""This is a dirty world, Britten, simply because it is a muddled world,"
1047,"and the thing you call morality is dirtier now than the thing you call"
1047,"immorality. Why don't the moralists pick their stuff out of the slime"
1047,"if they care for it, and wipe it?--damn them! I am burning now to say:"
1047,"'Yes, we did this and this,' to all the world. All the world!... I"
1047,"will!"""
1047,""
1047,"Britten rubbed the palm of his hand on the corner of his desk. ""That's"
1047,"all very well, Remington,"" he said. ""You mean to go."""
1047,""
1047,"He stopped and began again. ""If you didn't know you were in the wrong"
1047,"you wouldn't be so damned rhetorical. You're in the wrong. It's as plain"
1047,"to you as it is to me. You're leaving a big work, you're leaving a wife"
1047,"who trusted you, to go and live with your jolly mistress.... You won't"
1047,"see you're a statesman that matters, that no single man, maybe, might"
1047,"come to such influence as you in the next ten years. You're throwing"
1047,"yourself away and accusing your country of rejecting you."""
1047,""
1047,"He swung round upon his swivel at me. ""Remington,"" he said, ""have you"
1047,"forgotten the immense things our movement means?"""
1047,""
1047,"I thought. ""Perhaps I am rhetorical,"" I said."
1047,""
1047,"""But the things we might achieve! If you'd only stay now--even now! Oh!"
1047,"you'd suffer a little socially, but what of that? You'd be able to go"
1047,"on--perhaps all the better for hostility of the kind you'd get. You"
1047,"know, Remington--you KNOW."""
1047,""
1047,"I thought and went back to his earlier point. ""If I am rhetorical,"
1047,"at any rate it's a living feeling behind it. Yes, I remember all the"
1047,"implications of our aims--very splendid, very remote. But just now it's"
1047,"rather like offering to give a freezing man the sunlit Himalayas from"
1047,"end to end in return for his camp-fire. When you talk of me and my jolly"
1047,"mistress, it isn't fair. That misrepresents everything. I'm not going"
1047,"out of this--for delights. That's the sort of thing men like Snuffles"
1047,"and Keyhole imagine--that excites them! When I think of the things"
1047,"these creatures think! Ugh! But YOU know better? You know that physical"
1047,"passion that burns like a fire--ends clean. I'm going for love,"
1047,"Britten--if I sinned for passion. I'm going, Britten, because when I saw"
1047,"her the other day she HURT me. She hurt me damnably, Britten.... I've"
1047,"been a cold man--I've led a rhetorical life--you hit me with that"
1047,"word!--I put things in a windy way, I know, but what has got hold of"
1047,"me at last is her pain. She's ill. Don't you understand? She's a sick"
1047,"thing--a weak thing. She's no more a goddess than I'm a god.... I'm"
1047,"not in love with her now; I'm RAW with love for her. I feel like a man"
1047,"that's been flayed. I have been flayed.... You don't begin to imagine"
1047,"the sort of helpless solicitude.... She's not going to do things easily;"
1047,"she's ill. Her courage fails.... It's hard to put things when one isn't"
1047,"rhetorical, but it's this, Britten--there are distresses that matter"
1047,"more than all the delights or achievements in the world.... I made"
1047,"her what she is--as I never made Margaret. I've made her--I've broken"
1047,"her.... I'm going with my own woman. The rest of my life and England,"
1047,"and so forth, must square itself to that...."""
1047,""
1047,"For a long time, as it seemed, we remained silent and motionless. We'd"
1047,"said all we had to say. My eyes caught a printed slip upon the desk"
1047,"before him, and I came back abruptly to the paper."
1047,""
1047,"I picked up this galley proof. It was one of Winter's essays. ""This"
1047,"man goes on doing first-rate stuff,"" I said. ""I hope you will keep him"

1047,"He did not answer for a moment or so. ""I'll keep him going,"" he said at"

1047,"I have a letter Margaret wrote me within a week of our flight. I cannot"
1047,"resist transcribing some of it here, because it lights things as no word"
1047,"of mine can do. It is a string of nearly inconsecutive thoughts written"
1047,"in pencil in a fine, tall, sprawling hand. Its very inconsecutiveness is"
1047,"essential. Many words are underlined. It was in answer to one from me;"
1047,"but what I wrote has passed utterly from my mind...."
1047,""
1047,"""Certainly,"" she says, ""I want to hear from you, but I do not want"
1047,"to see you. There's a sort of abstract YOU that I want to go on with."
1047,"Something I've made out of you.... I want to know things about you--but"
1047,"I don't want to see or feel or imagine. When some day I have got rid"
1047,"of my intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may be different. Then"
1047,"perhaps we may meet again. I think it is even more the loss of our"
1047,"political work and dreams that I am feeling than the loss of your"
1047,"presence. Aching loss. I thought so much of the things we were DOING for"
1047,"the world--had given myself so unreservedly. You've left me with nothing"
1047,"to DO. I am suddenly at loose ends...."
1047,""
1047,"""We women are trained to be so dependent on a man. I've got no life of"

1047,"not a chance. I suppose you couldn't. All these things you and I stood"
1047,"away from. You let my first repugnances repel you...."
1047,""
1047,"""It is strange to think after all these years that I should be asking"

1047,"you. I feel you have taken my life, dragged it in your wake for a time,"
1047,"thrown it aside. I am resentful. Unfairly resentful, for why should I"
1047,"exact that you should watch and understand my life, when clearly I have"

1047,"""No human being is his own to do what he likes with. You were not"

1047,"It's my nature to hide--and you, you want things brought to you to see."
1047,"You are so curious as to be almost cruel. You don't understand reserves."

1047,"dream of the order that might replace the muddled system you hate, but"
1047,"by a sort of instinct you seem to want to break the law. I've watched"
1047,"you so closely. Now I want to obey laws, to make sacrifices, to follow"
1047,"rules. I don't want to make, but I do want to keep. You are at once"
1047,"makers and rebels, you and Isabel too. You're bad people--criminal"
1047,"people, I feel, and yet full of something the world must have. You're"
1047,"so much better than me, and so much viler. It may be there is no making"
1047,"without destruction, but it seems to me sometimes that it is nothing"
1047,"but an instinct for lawlessness that drives you. You remind me--do you"
1047,"remember?--of that time we went from Naples to Vesuvius, and walked"
1047,"over the hot new lava there. Do you remember how tired I was? I know it"
1047,"disappointed you that I was tired. One walked there in spite of the heat"
1047,"because there was a crust; like custom, like law. But directly a crust"
1047,"forms on things, you are restless to break down to the fire again."
1047,"You talk of beauty, both of you, as something terrible, mysterious,"
1047,"imperative. YOUR beauty is something altogether different from anything"
1047,"I know or feel. It has pain in it. Yet you always speak as though it was"
1047,"something I ought to feel and am dishonest not to feel. MY beauty is"
1047,"a quiet thing. You have always laughed at my feeling for old-fashioned"
1047,"chintz and blue china and Sheraton. But I like all these familiar USED"
1047,"things. My beauty is STILL beauty, and yours, is excitement. I"
1047,"know nothing of the fascination of the fire, or why one should go"
1047,"deliberately out of all the decent fine things of life to run dangers"
1047,"and be singed and tormented and destroyed. I don't understand...."""

1047,"I remember very freshly the mood of our departure from London, the"
1047,"platform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock overhead, the"
1047,"bustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of newsboys"
1047,"and boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends seeing"
1047,"travellers off by the boat train. Isabel sat very quiet and still in the"
1047,"compartment, and I stood upon the platform with the door open, with"
1047,"a curious reluctance to take the last step that should sever me from"
1047,"London's ground. I showed our tickets, and bought a handful of red roses"
1047,"for her. At last came the guards crying: ""Take your seats,"" and I got"
1047,"in and closed the door on me. We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to"
1047,"ourselves. I let down the window and stared out."
1047,""
1047,"There was a bustle of final adieux on the platform, a cry of ""Stand"
1047,"away, please, stand away!"" and the train was gliding slowly and smoothly"
1047,"out of the station."
1047,""
1047,"I looked out upon the river as the train rumbled with slowly gathering"
1047,"pace across the bridge, and the bobbing black heads of the pedestrians"
1047,"in the footway, and the curve of the river and the glowing great hotels,"
1047,"and the lights and reflections and blacknesses of that old, familiar"
1047,"spectacle. Then with a common thought, we turned our eyes westward to"
1047,"where the pinnacles of Westminster and the shining clock tower rose hard"
1047,"and clear against the still, luminous sky."
1047,""
1047,"""They'll be in Committee on the Reformatory Bill to-night,"" I said, a"

1047,"We said no more, but watched the south-side streets below--bright gleams"
1047,"of lights and movement, and the dark, dim, monstrous shapes of houses"
1047,"and factories. We ran through Waterloo Station, London Bridge, New"
1047,"Cross, St. John's. We said never a word. It seemed to me that for a time"
1047,"we had exhausted our emotions. We had escaped, we had cut our knot,"
1047,"we had accepted the last penalty of that headlong return of mine from"
1047,"Chicago a year and a half ago. That was all settled. That harvest of"
1047,"feelings we had reaped. I thought now only of London, of London as the"
1047,"symbol of all we were leaving and all we had lost in the world. I felt"
1047,"nothing now but an enormous and overwhelming regret...."
1047,""
1047,"The train swayed and rattled on its way. We ran through old Bromstead,"
1047,"where once I had played with cities and armies on the nursery floor. The"
1047,"sprawling suburbs with their scattered lights gave way to dim tree-set"
1047,"country under a cloud-veiled, intermittently shining moon. We passed"
1047,"Cardcaster Place. Perhaps old Wardingham, that pillar of the old"
1047,"Conservatives, was there, fretting over his unsuccessful struggle with"
1047,"our young Toryism. Little he recked of this new turn of the wheel and"
1047,"how it would confirm his contempt of all our novelties. Perhaps some"
1047,"faint intimation drew him to the window to see behind the stems of the"
1047,"young fir trees that bordered his domain, the little string of lighted"
1047,"carriage windows gliding southward...."

1047,"ambitions, London and the empire! It seemed to me we must be going"
1047,"out to a world that was utterly empty. All our significance fell from"
1047,"us--and before us was no meaning any more. We were leaving London; my"
1047,"hand, which had gripped so hungrily upon its complex life, had been"
1047,"forced from it, my fingers left their hold. That was over. I should"
1047,"never have a voice in public affairs again. The inexorable unwritten"
1047,"law which forbids overt scandal sentenced me. We were going out to a"
1047,"new life, a life that appeared in that moment to be a mere shrivelled"
1047,"remnant of me, a mere residuum of sheltering and feeding and seeing"
1047,"amidst alien scenery and the sound of unfamiliar tongues. We were going"
1047,"to live cheaply in a foreign place, so cut off that I meet now the"
1047,"merest stray tourist, the commonest tweed-clad stranger with a mixture"
1047,"of shyness and hunger.... And suddenly all the schemes I was leaving"
1047,"appeared fine and adventurous and hopeful as they had never done before."
1047,"How great was this purpose I had relinquished, this bold and subtle"
1047,"remaking of the English will! I had doubted so many things, and now"
1047,"suddenly I doubted my unimportance, doubted my right to this suicidal"
1047,"abandonment. Was I not a trusted messenger, greatly trusted and"
1047,"favoured, who had turned aside by the way? Had I not, after all, stood"
1047,"for far more than I had thought; was I not filching from that dear great"
1047,"city of my birth and life, some vitally necessary thing, a key, a link,"
1047,"a reconciling clue in her political development, that now she might seek"
1047,"vaguely for in vain? What is one life against the State? Ought I not"
1047,"to have sacrificed Isabel and all my passion and sorrow for Isabel, and"
1047,"held to my thing--stuck to my thing?"
1047,""
1047,"I heard as though he had spoken it in the carriage Britten's ""It WAS"
1047,"a good game."" No end of a game. And for the first time I imagined the"
1047,"faces and voices of Crupp and Esmeer and Gane when they learnt of"
1047,"this secret flight, this flight of which they were quite unwarned. And"
1047,"Shoesmith might be there in the house,--Shoesmith who was to have been"
1047,"married in four days--the thing might hit him full in front of any kind"
1047,"of people. Cruel eyes might watch him. Why the devil hadn't I written"
1047,"letters to warn them all? I could have posted them five minutes before"
1047,"the train started. I had never thought to that moment of the immense"
1047,"mess they would be in; how the whole edifice would clatter about their"
1047,"ears. I had a sudden desire to stop the train and go back for a day,"
1047,"for two days, to set that negligence right. My brain for a moment"
1047,"brightened, became animated and prolific of ideas. I thought of a"
1047,"brilliant line we might have taken on that confounded Reformatory"
1047,"Bill...."
1047,""
1047,"That sort of thing was over...."
1047,""
1047,"What indeed wasn't over? I passed to a vaguer, more multitudinous"
1047,"perception of disaster, the friends I had lost already since Altiora"
1047,"began her campaign, the ampler remnant whom now I must lose. I thought"
1047,"of people I had been merry with, people I had worked with and played"
1047,"with, the companions of talkative walks, the hostesses of houses that"
1047,"had once glowed with welcome for us both. I perceived we must lose them"
1047,"all. I saw life like a tree in late autumn that had once been rich and"
1047,"splendid with friends--and now the last brave dears would be hanging on"
1047,"doubtfully against the frosty chill of facts, twisting and tortured in"
1047,"the universal gale of indignation, trying to evade the cold blast of the"
1047,"truth. I had betrayed my party, my intimate friend, my wife, the"
1047,"wife whose devotion had made me what I was. For awhile the figure of"
1047,"Margaret, remote, wounded, shamed, dominated my mind, and the thought of"
1047,"my immense ingratitude. Damn them! they'd take it out of her too. I had"
1047,"a feeling that I wanted to go straight back and grip some one by the"
1047,"throat, some one talking ill of Margaret. They'd blame her for not"
1047,"keeping me, for letting things go so far.... I wanted the whole world"
1047,"to know how fine she was. I saw in imagination the busy, excited"
1047,"dinner tables at work upon us all, rather pleasantly excited, brightly"
1047,"indignant, merciless."
1047,""
1047,"Well, it's the stuff we are!..."
1047,""
1047,"Then suddenly, stabbing me to the heart, came a vision of Margaret's"
1047,"tears and the sound of her voice saying, ""Husband mine! Oh! husband"
1047,"mine! To see you cry!""..."
1047,""
1047,"I came out of a cloud of thoughts to discover the narrow compartment,"
1047,"with its feeble lamp overhead, and our rugs and hand-baggage swaying on"
1047,"the rack, and Isabel, very still in front of me, gripping my wilting red"
1047,"roses tightly in her bare and ringless hand."
1047,""
1047,"For a moment I could not understand her attitude, and then I perceived"
1047,"she was sitting bent together with her head averted from the light to"
1047,"hide the tears that were streaming down her face. She had not got her"
1047,"handkerchief out for fear that I should see this, but I saw her tears,"
1047,"dark drops of tears, upon her sleeve...."
1047,""
1047,"I suppose she had been watching my expression, divining my thoughts."
1047,""
1047,"For a time I stared at her and was motionless, in a sort of still and"
1047,"weary amazement. Why had we done this injury to one another? WHY? Then"
1047,"something stirred within me."
1047,""
1047,"""ISABEL!"" I whispered."
1047,""
1047,"She made no sign."
1047,""
1047,"""Isabel!"" I repeated, and then crossed over to her and crept closely to"
1047,"her, put my arm about her, and drew her wet cheek to mine."
