1212,"softened and somewhat impaired by the Misfortunes I have undergone, I"
1212,"was once beautiful. But lovely as I was the Graces of my Person were"
1212,"the least of my Perfections. Of every accomplishment accustomary to my"
1212,"sex, I was Mistress. When in the Convent, my progress had always"

1212,"Our neighbourhood was small, for it consisted only of your Mother. She"
1212,"may probably have already told you that being left by her Parents in"
1212,"indigent Circumstances she had retired into Wales on eoconomical"
1212,"motives. There it was our freindship first commenced. Isobel was then"

1212,"of our rustic Cot."
1212,""
1212,"My Father started—“What noise is that,” (said he.) “It sounds like a"
1212,"loud rapping at the door”—(replied my Mother.) “it does indeed.” (cried"
1212,"I.) “I am of your opinion; (said my Father) it certainly does appear to"
1212,"proceed from some uncommon violence exerted against our unoffending"
1212,"door.” “Yes (exclaimed I) I cannot help thinking it must be somebody"
1212,"who knocks for admittance.”"
1212,""
1212,"“That is another point (replied he;) We must not pretend to determine"
1212,"on what motive the person may knock—tho’ that someone _does_ rap at the"

1212,"better.” (answered he.) “Oh! let no time be lost” (cried I.)"
1212,""
1212,"A third more violent Rap than ever again assaulted our ears. “I am"

1212,"returned; (said I) I think I hear Mary going to the Door.” “I’m glad of"
1212,"it (cried my Father) for I long to know who it is.”"
1212,""
1212,"I was right in my conjecture; for Mary instantly entering the Room,"
1212,"informed us that a young Gentleman and his Servant were at the door,"
1212,"who had lossed their way, were very cold and begged leave to warm"
1212,"themselves by our fire."
1212,""
1212,"“Won’t you admit them?” (said I.) “You have no objection, my Dear?”"
1212,"(said my Father.) “None in the World.” (replied my Mother.)"

1212,"Mary, without waiting for any further commands immediately left the"
1212,"room and quickly returned introducing the most beauteous and amiable"
1212,"Youth, I had ever beheld. The servant she kept to herself."

1212,"My natural sensibility had already been greatly affected by the"

1212,"The noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay—for particular"
1212,"reasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot. He told us"
1212,"that he was the son of an English Baronet, that his Mother had been for"
1212,"many years no more and that he had a Sister of the middle size. “My"
1212,"Father (he continued) is a mean and mercenary wretch—it is only to such"

1212,"failings. Your Virtues my amiable Polydore (addressing himself to my"
1212,"father) yours Dear Claudia and yours my Charming Laura call on me to"
1212,"repose in you, my confidence.” We bowed. “My Father seduced by the"
1212,"false glare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title, insisted on my"
1212,"giving my hand to Lady Dorothea. No never exclaimed I. Lady Dorothea is"
1212,"lovely and Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know Sir, that I"

1212,"wonder (said he) did you pick up this unmeaning gibberish? You have"
1212,"been studying Novels I suspect.” I scorned to answer: it would have"

1212,"After taking an affecting Farewell of my Father, my Mother and my"
1212,"Isabel, I accompanied Edward to his Aunt’s in Middlesex. Philippa"
1212,"received us both with every expression of affectionate Love. My arrival"
1212,"was indeed a most agreable surprise to her as she had not only been"
1212,"totally ignorant of my Marriage with her Nephew, but had never even had"
1212,"the slightest idea of there being such a person in the World."
1212,""
1212,"Augusta, the sister of Edward was on a visit to her when we arrived. I"
1212,"found her exactly what her Brother had described her to be—of the"
1212,"middle size. She received me with equal surprise though not with equal"
1212,"Cordiality, as Philippa. There was a disagreable coldness and"
1212,"Forbidding Reserve in her reception of me which was equally distressing"
1212,"and Unexpected. None of that interesting Sensibility or amiable"
1212,"simpathy in her manners and Address to me when we first met which"
1212,"should have distinguished our introduction to each other. Her Language"
1212,"was neither warm, nor affectionate, her expressions of regard were"
1212,"neither animated nor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive me to"
1212,"her Heart, tho’ my own were extended to press her to mine."
1212,""
1212,"A short Conversation between Augusta and her Brother, which I"
1212,"accidentally overheard encreased my dislike to her, and convinced me"

1212,"Consequence or concern to me. Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you"
1212,"ever know me consult his inclinations or follow his Advice in the least"

1212,""
1212,"“And did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love, Augusta?"

1212,"corrupted Palate, to exist on Love? Can you not conceive the Luxury of"
1212,"living in every distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of"
1212,"your tenderest affection?”"

1212,"enough to be displeased with our behaviour and in a few weeks after,"
1212,"either to revenge our Conduct, or releive her own solitude, married a"
1212,"young and illiterate Fortune-hunter. This imprudent step (tho’ we were"
1212,"sensible that it would probably deprive us of that fortune which"

1212,"excite from our exalted minds a single sigh; yet fearfull lest it might"
1212,"prove a source of endless misery to the deluded Bride, our trembling"
1212,"Sensibility was greatly affected when we were first informed of the"
1212,"Event. The affectionate Entreaties of Augustus and Sophia that we would"
1212,"for ever consider their House as our Home, easily prevailed on us to"
1212,"determine never more to leave them, In the society of my Edward and"
1212,"this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest moments of my Life; Our time"
1212,"was most delightfully spent, in mutual Protestations of Freindship, and"
1212,"in vows of unalterable Love, in which we were secure from being"
1212,"interrupted, by intruding and disagreable Visitors, as Augustus and"
1212,"Sophia had on their first Entrance in the Neighbourhood, taken due care"
1212,"to inform the surrounding Families, that as their happiness centered"
1212,"wholly in themselves, they wished for no other society. But alas! my"
1212,"Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then enjoyed was too perfect to be"
1212,"lasting. A most severe and unexpected Blow at once destroyed every"
1212,"sensation of Pleasure. Convinced as you must be from what I have"
1212,"already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that there never were"
1212,"a happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that their union had"
1212,"been contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel and Mercenery Parents;"
1212,"who had vainly endeavoured with obstinate Perseverance to force them"
1212,"into a Marriage with those whom they had ever abhorred; but with a"
1212,"Heroic Fortitude worthy to be related and admired, they had both,"
1212,"constantly refused to submit to such despotic Power."

1212,"When we were somewhat recovered from the overpowering Effusions of our"
1212,"grief, Edward desired that we would consider what was the most prudent"
1212,"step to be taken in our unhappy situation while he repaired to his"
1212,"imprisoned freind to lament over his misfortunes. We promised that we"
1212,"would, and he set forwards on his journey to Town. During his absence"
1212,"we faithfully complied with his Desire and after the most mature"
1212,"Deliberation, at length agreed that the best thing we could do was to"
1212,"leave the House; of which we every moment expected the officers of"
1212,"Justice to take possession. We waited therefore with the greatest"
1212,"impatience, for the return of Edward in order to impart to him the"
1212,"result of our Deliberations. But no Edward appeared. In vain did we"
1212,"count the tedious moments of his absence—in vain did we weep—in vain"
1212,"even did we sigh—no Edward returned—. This was too cruel, too"
1212,"unexpected a Blow to our Gentle Sensibility—we could not support it—we"
1212,"could only faint. At length collecting all the Resolution I was"
1212,"Mistress of, I arose and after packing up some necessary apparel for"
1212,"Sophia and myself, I dragged her to a Carriage I had ordered and we"
1212,"instantly set out for London. As the Habitation of Augustus was within"
1212,"twelve miles of Town, it was not long e’er we arrived there, and no"
1212,"sooner had we entered Holboun than letting down one of the Front"

1212,"But as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated"

1212,"“Where am I to drive?” said the Postilion. “To Newgate Gentle Youth"
1212,"(replied I), to see Augustus.” “Oh! no, no, (exclaimed Sophia) I cannot"
1212,"go to Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus"
1212,"in so cruel a confinement—my feelings are sufficiently shocked by the"
1212,"_recital_, of his Distress, but to behold it will overpower my"
1212,"Sensibility.” As I perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her"
1212,"Sentiments the Postilion was instantly directed to return into the"
1212,"Country. You may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my Dearest"
1212,"Marianne, that in the Distress I then endured, destitute of any"
1212,"support, and unprovided with any Habitation, I should never once have"
1212,"remembered my Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of"
1212,"Uske. To account for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a"
1212,"trifling circumstance concerning them which I have as yet never"

1212,"“I have a Relation in Scotland (said Sophia to me as we left London)"
1212,"who I am certain would not hesitate in receiving me.” “Shall I order"
1212,"the Boy to drive there?” said I—but instantly recollecting myself,"
1212,"exclaimed, “Alas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the Horses.”"
1212,"Unwilling however to act only from my own inadequate Knowledge of the"
1212,"Strength and Abilities of Horses, I consulted the Postilion, who was"
1212,"entirely of my Opinion concerning the Affair. We therefore determined"
1212,"to change Horses at the next Town and to travel Post the remainder of"
1212,"the Journey—. When we arrived at the last Inn we were to stop at, which"
1212,"was but a few miles from the House of Sophia’s Relation, unwilling to"
1212,"intrude our Society on him unexpected and unthought of, we wrote a very"
1212,"elegant and well penned Note to him containing an account of our"
1212,"Destitute and melancholy Situation, and of our intention to spend some"
1212,"months with him in Scotland. As soon as we had dispatched this Letter,"
1212,"we immediately prepared to follow it in person and were stepping into"
1212,"the Carriage for that Purpose when our attention was attracted by the"
1212,"Entrance of a coroneted Coach and 4 into the Inn-yard. A Gentleman"
1212,"considerably advanced in years descended from it. At his first"
1212,"Appearance my Sensibility was wonderfully affected and e’er I had gazed"
1212,"at him a 2d time, an instinctive sympathy whispered to my Heart, that"
1212,"he was my Grandfather. Convinced that I could not be mistaken in my"
1212,"conjecture I instantly sprang from the Carriage I had just entered, and"
1212,"following the Venerable Stranger into the Room he had been shewn to, I"
1212,"threw myself on my knees before him and besought him to acknowledge me"
1212,"as his Grand Child. He started, and having attentively examined my"
1212,"features, raised me from the Ground and throwing his Grand-fatherly"
1212,"arms around my Neck, exclaimed, “Acknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance"
1212,"of my Laurina and Laurina’s Daughter, sweet image of my Claudia and my"
1212,"Claudia’s Mother, I do acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and"
1212,"the Grandaughter of the other.” While he was thus tenderly embracing"
1212,"me, Sophia astonished at my precipitate Departure, entered the Room in"
1212,"search of me. No sooner had she caught the eye of the venerable Peer,"
1212,"than he exclaimed with every mark of Astonishment—“Another"
1212,"Grandaughter! Yes, yes, I see you are the Daughter of my Laurina’s"
1212,"eldest Girl; your resemblance to the beauteous Matilda sufficiently"
1212,"proclaims it. “Oh!” replied Sophia, “when I first beheld you the"
1212,"instinct of Nature whispered me that we were in some degree related—But"
1212,"whether Grandfathers, or Grandmothers, I could not pretend to"
1212,"determine.” He folded her in his arms, and whilst they were tenderly"
1212,"embracing, the Door of the Apartment opened and a most beautifull young"
1212,"Man appeared. On perceiving him Lord St. Clair started and retreating"
1212,"back a few paces, with uplifted Hands, said, “Another Grand-child! What"
1212,"an unexpected Happiness is this! to discover in the space of 3 minutes,"
1212,"as many of my Descendants! This I am certain is Philander the son of my"
1212,"Laurina’s 3d girl the amiable Bertha; there wants now but the presence"

1212,"You may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure"
1212,"of Lord St Clair. “Ignoble Grand-sire!” exclaimed Sophia. “Unworthy"
1212,"Grandfather!” said I, and instantly fainted in each other’s arms. How"
1212,"long we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered we"
1212,"found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, Philander, or the"
1212,"Banknotes. As we were deploring our unhappy fate, the Door of the"
1212,"Apartment opened and “Macdonald” was announced. He was Sophia’s cousin."
1212,"The haste with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt of"
1212,"our Note, spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to"
1212,"pronounce him at first sight, a tender and simpathetic Freind. Alas! he"
1212,"little deserved the name—for though he told us that he was much"
1212,"concerned at our Misfortunes, yet by his own account it appeared that"
1212,"the perusal of them, had neither drawn from him a single sigh, nor"
1212,"induced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive stars—. He told"
1212,"Sophia that his Daughter depended on her returning with him to"
1212,"Macdonald-Hall, and that as his Cousin’s freind he should be happy to"
1212,"see me there also. To Macdonald-Hall, therefore we went, and were"
1212,"received with great kindness by Janetta the Daughter of Macdonald, and"
1212,"the Mistress of the Mansion. Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally"
1212,"well disposed, endowed with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic"
1212,"Disposition, she might, had these amiable qualities been properly"
1212,"encouraged, have been an ornament to human Nature; but unfortunately"
1212,"her Father possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted to admire so"
1212,"promising a Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his"
1212,"power to prevent it encreasing with her Years. He had actually so far"
1212,"extinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail"
1212,"on her to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation. They"
1212,"were to be married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when"
1212,"we arrived. _We_ soon saw through his character. He was just such a Man"
1212,"as one might have expected to be the choice of Macdonald. They said he"
1212,"was Sensible, well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge"
1212,"of such trifles, but as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had"
1212,"never read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least"
1212,"resemblance to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could feel no"
1212,"affection for him, or at least that she ought to feel none. The very"
1212,"circumstance of his being her father’s choice too, was so much in his"
1212,"disfavour, that had he been deserving her, in every other respect yet"
1212,"_that_ of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the Eyes of"
1212,"Janetta for rejecting him. These considerations we were determined to"
1212,"represent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting with"
1212,"the desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors"
1212,"in the affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her"
1212,"own opinion, and a suitable contempt of her father’s. We found her"
1212,"indeed all that our warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no"
1212,"difficulty to convince her that it was impossible she could love"
1212,"Graham, or that it was her Duty to disobey her Father; the only thing"
1212,"at which she rather seemed to hesitate was our assertion that she must"
1212,"be attached to some other Person. For some time, she persevered in"
1212,"declaring that she knew no other young man for whom she had the the"
1212,"smallest Affection; but upon explaining the impossibility of such a"
1212,"thing she said that she beleived she _did like_ Captain M’Kenrie better"
1212,"than any one she knew besides. This confession satisfied us and after"
1212,"having enumerated the good Qualities of M’Kenrie and assured her that"
1212,"she was violently in love with him, we desired to know whether he had"
1212,"ever in any wise declared his affection to her."
1212,""
1212,"“So far from having ever declared it, I have no reason to imagine that"
1212,"he has ever felt any for me.” said Janetta. “That he certainly adores"
1212,"you (replied Sophia) there can be no doubt—. The Attachment must be"
1212,"reciprocal. Did he never gaze on you with admiration—tenderly press"
1212,"your hand—drop an involantary tear—and leave the room abruptly?” “Never"
1212,"(replied she) that I remember—he has always left the room indeed when"
1212,"his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly abruptly"
1212,"or without making a bow.” Indeed my Love (said I) you must be"
1212,"mistaken—for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left"
1212,"you but with Confusion, Despair, and Precipitation. Consider but for a"
1212,"moment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose"
1212,"that he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person.” Having"
1212,"settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into"
1212,"consideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform"
1212,"M’Kenrie of the favourable Opinion Janetta entertained of him.... We at"
1212,"length agreed to acquaint him with it by an anonymous Letter which"

1212,"Graham had entertained any suspicion of the affair. And they might not"
1212,"even then have suspected it, but for the following little Accident."
1212,"Sophia happening one day to open a private Drawer in Macdonald’s"
1212,"Library with one of her own keys, discovered that it was the Place"
1212,"where he kept his Papers of consequence and amongst them some bank"
1212,"notes of considerable amount. This discovery she imparted to me; and"
1212,"having agreed together that it would be a proper treatment of so vile a"
1212,"Wretch as Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly"
1212,"gained, it was determined that the next time we should either of us"
1212,"happen to go that way, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from"
1212,"the drawer. This well meant Plan we had often successfully put in"
1212,"Execution; but alas! on the very day of Janetta’s Escape, as Sophia was"
1212,"majestically removing the 5th Bank-note from the Drawer to her own"
1212,"purse, she was suddenly most impertinently interrupted in her"
1212,"employment by the entrance of Macdonald himself, in a most abrupt and"
1212,"precipitate Manner. Sophia (who though naturally all winning sweetness"
1212,"could when occasions demanded it call forth the Dignity of her sex)"
1212,"instantly put on a most forbidding look, and darting an angry frown on"
1212,"the undaunted culprit, demanded in a haughty tone of voice “Wherefore"
1212,"her retirement was thus insolently broken in on?” The unblushing"
1212,"Macdonald, without even endeavouring to exculpate himself from the"
1212,"crime he was charged with, meanly endeavoured to reproach Sophia with"
1212,"ignobly defrauding him of his money... The dignity of Sophia was"
1212,"wounded; “Wretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing the Bank-note in the"
1212,"Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act, of which the bare idea"
1212,"makes me blush?” The base wretch was still unconvinced and continued to"
1212,"upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such opprobious Language, that at"
1212,"length he so greatly provoked the gentle sweetness of her Nature, as to"
1212,"induce her to revenge herself on him by informing him of Janetta’s"
1212,"Elopement, and of the active Part we had both taken in the affair. At"
1212,"this period of their Quarrel I entered the Library and was as you may"
1212,"imagine equally offended as Sophia at the ill-grounded accusations of"
1212,"the malevolent and contemptible Macdonald. “Base Miscreant! (cried I)"
1212,"how canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to sully the spotless"
1212,"reputation of such bright Excellence? Why dost thou not suspect _my_"
1212,"innocence as soon?” “Be satisfied Madam (replied he) I _do_ suspect it,"

1212,"I—and then changing the conversation, desired her to admire the noble"
1212,"Grandeur of the Elms which sheltered us from the Eastern Zephyr. “Alas!"
1212,"my Laura (returned she) avoid so melancholy a subject, I intreat you."
1212,"Do not again wound my Sensibility by observations on those elms. They"
1212,"remind me of Augustus. He was like them, tall, magestic—he possessed"
1212,"that noble grandeur which you admire in them.”"
1212,""
1212,"I was silent, fearfull lest I might any more unwillingly distress her"
1212,"by fixing on any other subject of conversation which might again remind"
1212,"her of Augustus."
1212,""
1212,"“Why do you not speak my Laura? (said she after a short pause) “I"
1212,"cannot support this silence you must not leave me to my own"
1212,"reflections; they ever recur to Augustus.”"

1212,"“What a beautifull sky! (said I) How charmingly is the azure varied by"

1212,"momentary glance at the sky) do not thus distress me by calling my"
1212,"Attention to an object which so cruelly reminds me of my Augustus’s"
1212,"blue sattin waistcoat striped in white! In pity to your unhappy freind"
1212,"avoid a subject so distressing.” What could I do? The feelings of"
1212,"Sophia were at that time so exquisite, and the tenderness she felt for"
1212,"Augustus so poignant that I had not power to start any other topic,"
1212,"justly fearing that it might in some unforseen manner again awaken all"
1212,"her sensibility by directing her thoughts to her Husband. Yet to be"
1212,"silent would be cruel; she had intreated me to talk."
1212,""
1212,"From this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly"
1212,"apropos; it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman’s Phaeton, on the"
1212,"road which ran murmuring behind us. It was a most fortunate accident as"
1212,"it diverted the attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections"
1212,"which she had been before indulging. We instantly quitted our seats and"
1212,"ran to the rescue of those who but a few moments before had been in so"
1212,"elevated a situation as a fashionably high Phaeton, but who were now"
1212,"laid low and sprawling in the Dust. “What an ample subject for"
1212,"reflection on the uncertain Enjoyments of this World, would not that"
1212,"Phaeton and the Life of Cardinal Wolsey afford a thinking Mind!” said I"
1212,"to Sophia as we were hastening to the field of Action."
1212,""
1212,"She had not time to answer me, for every thought was now engaged by the"
1212,"horrid spectacle before us. Two Gentlemen most elegantly attired but"
1212,"weltering in their blood was what first struck our Eyes—we"
1212,"approached—they were Edward and Augustus—. Yes dearest Marianne they"
1212,"were our Husbands. Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground—I screamed"
1212,"and instantly ran mad—. We remained thus mutually deprived of our"
1212,"senses, some minutes, and on regaining them were deprived of them"
1212,"again. For an Hour and a Quarter did we continue in this unfortunate"
1212,"situation—Sophia fainting every moment and I running mad as often. At"
1212,"length a groan from the hapless Edward (who alone retained any share of"
1212,"life) restored us to ourselves. Had we indeed before imagined that"
1212,"either of them lived, we should have been more sparing of our Greif—but"
1212,"as we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no more, we"
1212,"knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about. No"
1212,"sooner did we therefore hear my Edward’s groan than postponing our"
1212,"lamentations for the present, we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and"
1212,"kneeling on each side of him implored him not to die—. “Laura (said He"

1212,"Mistress of; summon up all the fortitude you possess, for alas! in the"

1212,"tried. Ah! what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which"
1212,"I have already related to you, to the one I am now going to inform you"
1212,"of. The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost"
1212,"more than my gentle Nature could support, were trifles in comparison to"
1212,"the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate. The morning after our"
1212,"arrival at the Cottage, Sophia complained of a violent pain in her"
1212,"delicate limbs, accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed"
1212,"it to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the"
1212,"Dew was falling the Evening before. This I feared was but too probably"
1212,"the case; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should"
1212,"have escaped the same indisposition, but by supposing that the bodily"
1212,"Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so"
1212,"effectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against"
1212,"the chilling Damps of Night, whereas, Sophia lying totally inactive on"
1212,"the ground must have been exposed to all their severity. I was most"
1212,"seriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to"
1212,"you, a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me, would in the End"
1212,"be fatal to her."
1212,""
1212,"Alas! my fears were but too fully justified; she grew gradually"
1212,"worse—and I daily became more alarmed for her. At length she was"
1212,"obliged to confine herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy"
1212,"Landlady—. Her disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few"
1212,"days carried her off. Amidst all my Lamentations for her (and violent"
1212,"you may suppose they were) I yet received some consolation in the"
1212,"reflection of my having paid every attention to her, that could be"
1212,"offered, in her illness. I had wept over her every Day—had bathed her"
1212,"sweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in"
1212,"mine—. “My beloved Laura (said she to me a few Hours before she died)"
1212,"take warning from my unhappy End and avoid the imprudent conduct which"
1212,"had occasioned it... Beware of fainting-fits... Though at the time they"
1212,"may be refreshing and agreable yet beleive me they will in the end, if"
1212,"too often repeated and at improper seasons, prove destructive to your"

1212,"These were the last words she ever addressed to me.. It was her dieing"
1212,"Advice to her afflicted Laura, who has ever most faithfully adhered to"

1212,""
1212,"After having attended my lamented freind to her Early Grave, I"
1212,"immediately (tho’ late at night) left the detested Village in which she"
1212,"died, and near which had expired my Husband and Augustus. I had not"
1212,"walked many yards from it before I was overtaken by a stage-coach, in"
1212,"which I instantly took a place, determined to proceed in it to"
1212,"Edinburgh, where I hoped to find some kind some pitying Freind who"
1212,"would receive and comfort me in my afflictions."
1212,""
1212,"It was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish"
1212,"the Number of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they"
1212,"were many. Regardless however of anything concerning them, I gave"
1212,"myself up to my own sad Reflections. A general silence prevailed—A"
1212,"silence, which was by nothing interrupted but by the loud and repeated"
1212,"snores of one of the Party."
1212,""
1212,"“What an illiterate villain must that man be! (thought I to myself)"
1212,"What a total want of delicate refinement must he have, who can thus"
1212,"shock our senses by such a brutal noise! He must I am certain be"
1212,"capable of every bad action! There is no crime too black for such a"
1212,"Character!” Thus reasoned I within myself, and doubtless such were the"
1212,"reflections of my fellow travellers."
1212,""
1212,"At length, returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled"
1212,"Scoundrel who had so violently disturbed my feelings. It was Sir Edward"
1212,"the father of my Deceased Husband. By his side sate Augusta, and on the"
1212,"same seat with me were your Mother and Lady Dorothea. Imagine my"
1212,"surprise at finding myself thus seated amongst my old Acquaintance."
1212,"Great as was my astonishment, it was yet increased, when on looking out"
1212,"of Windows, I beheld the Husband of Philippa, with Philippa by his"
1212,"side, on the Coachbox and when on looking behind I beheld, Philander"
1212,"and Gustavus in the Basket. “Oh! Heavens, (exclaimed I) is it possible"
1212,"that I should so unexpectedly be surrounded by my nearest Relations and"
1212,"Connections?” These words roused the rest of the Party, and every eye"
1212,"was directed to the corner in which I sat. “Oh! my Isabel (continued I"
1212,"throwing myself across Lady Dorothea into her arms) receive once more"
1212,"to your Bosom the unfortunate Laura. Alas! when we last parted in the"
1212,"Vale of Usk, I was happy in being united to the best of Edwards; I had"
1212,"then a Father and a Mother, and had never known misfortunes—But now"
1212,"deprived of every freind but you—”"

1212,"Sir Edward’s intreaties that I would inform them of the whole"
1212,"melancholy affair. They were greatly shocked—even the obdurate Heart of"
1212,"Sir Edward and the insensible one of Augusta, were touched with sorrow,"
1212,"by the unhappy tale. At the request of your Mother I related to them"
1212,"every other misfortune which had befallen me since we parted. Of the"
1212,"imprisonment of Augustus and the absence of Edward—of our arrival in"
1212,"Scotland—of our unexpected Meeting with our Grand-father and our"
1212,"cousins—of our visit to Macdonald-Hall—of the singular service we there"
1212,"performed towards Janetta—of her Fathers ingratitude for it.. of his"
1212,"inhuman Behaviour, unaccountable suspicions, and barbarous treatment of"
1212,"us, in obliging us to leave the House.. of our lamentations on the loss"
1212,"of Edward and Augustus and finally of the melancholy Death of my"
1212,"beloved Companion."
1212,""
1212,"Pity and surprise were strongly depictured in your Mother’s"
1212,"countenance, during the whole of my narration, but I am sorry to say,"
1212,"that to the eternal reproach of her sensibility, the latter infinitely"
1212,"predominated. Nay, faultless as my conduct had certainly been during"
1212,"the whole course of my late misfortunes and adventures, she pretended"
1212,"to find fault with my behaviour in many of the situations in which I"
1212,"had been placed. As I was sensible myself, that I had always behaved in"
1212,"a manner which reflected Honour on my Feelings and Refinement, I paid"
1212,"little attention to what she said, and desired her to satisfy my"
1212,"Curiosity by informing me how she came there, instead of wounding my"
1212,"spotless reputation with unjustifiable Reproaches. As soon as she had"
1212,"complyed with my wishes in this particular and had given me an accurate"
1212,"detail of every thing that had befallen her since our separation (the"
1212,"particulars of which if you are not already acquainted with, your"
1212,"Mother will give you) I applied to Augusta for the same information"
1212,"respecting herself, Sir Edward and Lady Dorothea."
1212,""
1212,"She told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of"
1212,"Nature, her curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in"
1212,"that part of the World had been so much raised by Gilpin’s Tour to the"
1212,"Highlands, that she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to"
1212,"Scotland and had persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them. That they"
1212,"had arrived at Edinburgh a few Days before and from thence had made"
1212,"daily Excursions into the Country around in the Stage Coach they were"
1212,"then in, from one of which Excursions they were at that time returning."
1212,"My next enquiries were concerning Philippa and her Husband, the latter"
1212,"of whom I learned having spent all her fortune, had recourse for"
1212,"subsistence to the talent in which, he had always most excelled,"
1212,"namely, Driving, and that having sold every thing which belonged to"
1212,"them except their Coach, had converted it into a Stage and in order to"
1212,"be removed from any of his former Acquaintance, had driven it to"
1212,"Edinburgh from whence he went to Sterling every other Day. That"
1212,"Philippa still retaining her affection for her ungratefull Husband, had"
1212,"followed him to Scotland and generally accompanied him in his little"
1212,"Excursions to Sterling. “It has only been to throw a little money into"
1212,"their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my Father has always travelled"
1212,"in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the Country since our arrival in"
1212,"Scotland—for it would certainly have been much more agreable to us, to"
1212,"visit the Highlands in a Postchaise than merely to travel from"
1212,"Edinburgh to Sterling and from Sterling to Edinburgh every other Day in"
1212,"a crowded and uncomfortable Stage.” I perfectly agreed with her in her"
1212,"sentiments on the affair, and secretly blamed Sir Edward for thus"
1212,"sacrificing his Daughter’s Pleasure for the sake of a ridiculous old"
1212,"woman whose folly in marrying so young a man ought to be punished. His"
1212,"Behaviour however was entirely of a peice with his general Character;"
1212,"for what could be expected from a man who possessed not the smallest"

1212,"When we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast, I was"
1212,"determined to speak with Philander and Gustavus, and to that purpose as"
1212,"soon as I left the Carriage, I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired"
1212,"after their Health, expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their"
1212,"situation. At first they seemed rather confused at my appearance"
1212,"dreading no doubt that I might call them to account for the money which"
1212,"our Grandfather had left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of,"
1212,"but finding that I mentioned nothing of the Matter, they desired me to"
1212,"step into the Basket as we might there converse with greater ease."
1212,"Accordingly I entered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring"

1212,"and sentimental Manner by a confidential Conversation. I informed them"
1212,"of every thing which had befallen me during the course of my life, and"
1212,"at my request they related to me every incident of theirs."

1212,"“We are the sons as you already know, of the two youngest Daughters"
1212,"which Lord St Clair had by Laurina an italian opera girl. Our mothers"
1212,"could neither of them exactly ascertain who were our Father, though it"
1212,"is generally beleived that Philander, is the son of one Philip Jones a"
1212,"Bricklayer and that my Father was one Gregory Staves a Staymaker of"
1212,"Edinburgh. This is however of little consequence for as our Mothers"
1212,"were certainly never married to either of them it reflects no Dishonour"
1212,"on our Blood, which is of a most ancient and unpolluted kind. Bertha"
1212,"(the Mother of Philander) and Agatha (my own Mother) always lived"
1212,"together. They were neither of them very rich; their united fortunes"
1212,"had originally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had always"
1212,"lived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to"
1212,"nine Hundred. This nine Hundred they always kept in a Drawer in one of"
1212,"the Tables which stood in our common sitting Parlour, for the"
1212,"convenience of having it always at Hand. Whether it was from this"
1212,"circumstance, of its being easily taken, or from a wish of being"
1212,"independant, or from an excess of sensibility (for which we were always"
1212,"remarkable) I cannot now determine, but certain it is that when we had"
1212,"reached our 15th year, we took the nine Hundred Pounds and ran away."
1212,"Having obtained this prize we were determined to manage it with"
1212,"eoconomy and not to spend it either with folly or Extravagance. To this"
1212,"purpose we therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we"
1212,"devoted to Victuals, the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th"
1212,"to Carriages, the 5th to Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to"
1212,"Amusements, the 8th to Cloathes and the 9th to Silver Buckles. Having"
1212,"thus arranged our Expences for two months (for we expected to make the"
1212,"nine Hundred Pounds last as long) we hastened to London and had the"
1212,"good luck to spend it in 7 weeks and a Day which was 6 Days sooner than"
1212,"we had intended. As soon as we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves"
1212,"from the weight of so much money, we began to think of returning to our"
1212,"Mothers, but accidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death,"
1212,"we gave over the design and determined to engage ourselves to some"
1212,"strolling Company of Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage."
1212,"Accordingly we offered our services to one and were accepted; our"
1212,"Company was indeed rather small, as it consisted only of the Manager"
1212,"his wife and ourselves, but there were fewer to pay and the only"
1212,"inconvenience attending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for want of"
1212,"People to fill the Characters, we could perform. We did not mind"
1212,"trifles however—. One of our most admired Performances was _Macbeth_,"
1212,"in which we were truly great. The Manager always played _Banquo_"
1212,"himself, his Wife my _Lady Macbeth_. I did the _Three Witches_ and"
1212,"Philander acted _all the rest_. To say the truth this tragedy was not"
1212,"only the Best, but the only Play that we ever performed; and after"
1212,"having acted it all over England, and Wales, we came to Scotland to"
1212,"exhibit it over the remainder of Great Britain. We happened to be"

1212,"We were in the Inn-yard when his Carriage entered and perceiving by the"

1212,"obtained the two Hundred Pounds, we instantly left the Town, leaving"

1212,"My Brother has just left us. “Matilda (said he at parting) you and"
1212,"Margaret will I am certain take all the care of my dear little one,"
1212,"that she might have received from an indulgent, and affectionate and"
1212,"amiable Mother.” Tears rolled down his cheeks as he spoke these"
1212,"words—the remembrance of her, who had so wantonly disgraced the"
1212,"Maternal character and so openly violated the conjugal Duties,"
1212,"prevented his adding anything farther; he embraced his sweet Child and"
1212,"after saluting Matilda and Me hastily broke from us and seating himself"
1212,"in his Chaise, pursued the road to Aberdeen. Never was there a better"
1212,"young Man! Ah! how little did he deserve the misfortunes he has"
1212,"experienced in the Marriage state. So good a Husband to so bad a Wife!"
1212,"for you know my dear Charlotte that the Worthless Louisa left him, her"
1212,"Child and reputation a few weeks ago in company with Danvers and"
1212,"dishonour. Never was there a sweeter face, a finer form, or a less"
1212,"amiable Heart than Louisa owned! Her child already possesses the"
1212,"personal Charms of her unhappy Mother! May she inherit from her Father"
1212,"all his mental ones! Lesley is at present but five and twenty, and has"
1212,"already given himself up to melancholy and Despair; what a difference"
1212,"between him and his Father! Sir George is 57 and still remains the"
1212,"Beau, the flighty stripling, the gay Lad, and sprightly Youngster, that"
1212,"his Son was really about five years back, and that _he_ has affected to"
1212,"appear ever since my remembrance. While our father is fluttering about"
1212,"the streets of London, gay, dissipated, and Thoughtless at the age of"
1212,"57, Matilda and I continue secluded from Mankind in our old and"
1212,"Mouldering Castle, which is situated two miles from Perth on a bold"
1212,"projecting Rock, and commands an extensive veiw of the Town and its"
1212,"delightful Environs. But tho’ retired from almost all the World, (for"
1212,"we visit no one but the M’Leods, The M’Kenzies, the M’Phersons, the"
1212,"M’Cartneys, the M’Donalds, The M’kinnons, the M’lellans, the M’kays,"
1212,"the Macbeths and the Macduffs) we are neither dull nor unhappy; on the"
1212,"contrary there never were two more lively, more agreable or more witty"
1212,"girls, than we are; not an hour in the Day hangs heavy on our Hands. We"
1212,"read, we work, we walk, and when fatigued with these Employments"
1212,"releive our spirits, either by a lively song, a graceful Dance, or by"
1212,"some smart bon-mot, and witty repartee. We are handsome my dear"
1212,"Charlotte, very handsome and the greatest of our Perfections is, that"
1212,"we are entirely insensible of them ourselves. But why do I thus dwell"
1212,"on myself! Let me rather repeat the praise of our dear little Neice the"
1212,"innocent Louisa, who is at present sweetly smiling in a gentle Nap, as"
1212,"she reposes on the sofa. The dear Creature is just turned of two years"
1212,"old; as handsome as tho’ 2 and 20, as sensible as tho’ 2 and 30, and as"
1212,"prudent as tho’ 2 and 40. To convince you of this, I must inform you"
1212,"that she has a very fine complexion and very pretty features, that she"
1212,"already knows the two first letters in the Alphabet, and that she never"
1212,"tears her frocks—. If I have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense"
1212,"and Prudence, I have nothing more to urge in support of my assertion,"
1212,"and you will therefore have no way of deciding the Affair but by coming"
1212,"to Lesley-Castle, and by a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine"
1212,"for yourself. Ah! my dear Freind, how happy should I be to see you"
1212,"within these venerable Walls! It is now four years since my removal"
1212,"from School has separated me from you; that two such tender Hearts, so"
1212,"closely linked together by the ties of simpathy and Freindship, should"
1212,"be so widely removed from each other, is vastly moving. I live in"
1212,"Perthshire, You in Sussex. We might meet in London, were my Father"
1212,"disposed to carry me there, and were your Mother to be there at the"
1212,"same time. We might meet at Bath, at Tunbridge, or anywhere else"
1212,"indeed, could we but be at the same place together. We have only to"
1212,"hope that such a period may arrive. My Father does not return to us"
1212,"till Autumn; my Brother will leave Scotland in a few Days; he is"
1212,"impatient to travel. Mistaken Youth! He vainly flatters himself that"
1212,"change of Air will heal the Wounds of a broken Heart! You will join"
1212,"with me I am certain my dear Charlotte, in prayers for the recovery of"
1212,"the unhappy Lesley’s peace of Mind, which must ever be essential to"
1212,"that of your sincere freind"

1212,"Glenford Febry 12"
1212,""
1212,"I have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking"
1212,"you my dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should"
1212,"not have deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the"
1212,"last five weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements"
1212,"for my sisters wedding, as to allow me no time to devote either to you"
1212,"or myself. And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the"
1212,"Match is broke off, and all my Labour thrown away. Imagine how great"
1212,"the Dissapointment must be to me, when you consider that after having"
1212,"laboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get the Wedding dinner"
1212,"ready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef, Broiled Mutton,"
1212,"and Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the"
1212,"Honey-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been"
1212,"Roasting, Broiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose."
1212,"Indeed my dear Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to"
1212,"what I experienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in"
1212,"the store-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me"
1212,"that Hervey had been thrown from his Horse, had fractured his Scull and"
1212,"was pronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger. “Good"
1212,"God! (said I) you dont say so? Why what in the name of Heaven will"
1212,"become of all the Victuals! We shall never be able to eat it while it"
1212,"is good. However, we’ll call in the Surgeon to help us. I shall be able"
1212,"to manage the Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and You and"
1212,"the Doctor must finish the rest.” Here I was interrupted, by seeing my"
1212,"poor Sister fall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests,"
1212,"where we keep our Table linen. I immediately called my Mother and the"
1212,"Maids, and at last we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she"
1212,"was sensible, she expressed a determination of going instantly to"
1212,"Henry, and was so wildly bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest"
1212,"Difficulty in the World to prevent her putting it in execution; at last"
1212,"however more by Force than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her"
1212,"room; we laid her upon the Bed, and she continued for some Hours in the"
1212,"most dreadful Convulsions. My Mother and I continued in the room with"
1212,"her, and when any intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would"
1212,"allow us, we joined in heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in"
1212,"our provisions which this Event must occasion, and in concerting some"
1212,"plan for getting rid of them. We agreed that the best thing we could do"
1212,"was to begin eating them immediately, and accordingly we ordered up the"
1212,"cold Ham and Fowls, and instantly began our Devouring Plan on them with"
1212,"great Alacrity. We would have persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of"
1212,"a Chicken, but she would not be persuaded. She was however much quieter"
1212,"than she had been; the convulsions she had before suffered having given"
1212,"way to an almost perfect Insensibility. We endeavoured to rouse her by"
1212,"every means in our power, but to no purpose. I talked to her of Henry."
1212,"“Dear Eloisa (said I) there’s no occasion for your crying so much about"
1212,"such a trifle. (for I was willing to make light of it in order to"
1212,"comfort her) I beg you would not mind it—You see it does not vex me in"
1212,"the least; though perhaps I may suffer most from it after all; for I"
1212,"shall not only be obliged to eat up all the Victuals I have dressed"
1212,"already, but must if Henry should recover (which however is not very"
1212,"likely) dress as much for you again; or should he die (as I suppose he"
1212,"will) I shall still have to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry"
1212,"any one else. So you see that tho’ perhaps for the present it may"
1212,"afflict you to think of Henry’s sufferings, Yet I dare say he’ll die"
1212,"soon, and then his pain will be over and you will be easy, whereas my"
1212,"Trouble will last much longer for work as hard as I may, I am certain"
1212,"that the pantry cannot be cleared in less than a fortnight.” Thus I did"
1212,"all in my power to console her, but without any effect, and at last as"
1212,"I saw that she did not seem to listen to me, I said no more, but"
1212,"leaving her with my Mother I took down the remains of The Ham and"
1212,"Chicken, and sent William to ask how Henry did. He was not expected to"
1212,"live many Hours; he died the same day. We took all possible care to"
1212,"break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the tenderest manner; yet in"
1212,"spite of every precaution, her sufferings on hearing it were too"
1212,"violent for her reason, and she continued for many hours in a high"
1212,"Delirium. She is still extremely ill, and her Physicians are greatly"
1212,"afraid of her going into a Decline. We are therefore preparing for"
1212,"Bristol, where we mean to be in the course of the next week. And now my"
1212,"dear Margaret let me talk a little of your affairs; and in the first"
1212,"place I must inform you that it is confidently reported, your Father is"
1212,"going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so unpleasing a"
1212,"report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I have written"
1212,"to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning it, which as"
1212,"she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give me. I know not"
1212,"who is the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely right in the"
1212,"resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps contribute to"
1212,"obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events, which have"
1212,"lately so much afflicted him—I am happy to find that tho’ secluded from"
1212,"all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or unhappy—that you may"
1212,"never know what it is to, be either is the wish of your sincerely"

1212,""
1212,""
1212,"Lesley Castle February the 16th"
1212,""
1212,"I _have_ made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my"
1212,"Dear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were. I"
1212,"reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a"
1212,"second family, our fortunes must be considerably diminushed—that if his"
1212,"Wife should be of an extravagant turn, she would encourage him to"
1212,"persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little"
1212,"encouragement would be necessary, and which has I fear already proved"
1212,"but too detrimental to his health and fortune—that she would now become"
1212,"Mistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother, and which Sir"
1212,"George had always promised us—that if they did not come into Perthshire"
1212,"I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my"
1212,"Mother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit at the"
1212,"head of her Father’s table—. These my dear Charlotte were the"
1212,"melancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing"
1212,"Susan’s letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she"
1212,"had perused it likewise. The same ideas, the same fears, immediately"
1212,"occupied her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most,"
1212,"whether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own"
1212,"Consequence. We both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is"
1212,"handsome and what is your opinion of her; as you honour her with the"
1212,"appellation of your freind, we flatter ourselves that she must be"
1212,"amiable. My Brother is already in Paris. He intends to quit it in a few"
1212,"Days, and to begin his route to Italy. He writes in a most chearfull"
1212,"manner, says that the air of France has greatly recovered both his"
1212,"Health and Spirits; that he has now entirely ceased to think of Louisa"
1212,"with any degree either of Pity or Affection, that he even feels himself"
1212,"obliged to her for her Elopement, as he thinks it very good fun to be"
1212,"single again. By this, you may perceive that he has entirely regained"
1212,"that chearful Gaiety, and sprightly Wit, for which he was once so"
1212,"remarkable. When he first became acquainted with Louisa which was"
1212,"little more than three years ago, he was one of the most lively, the"
1212,"most agreable young Men of the age—. I beleive you never yet heard the"
1212,"particulars of his first acquaintance with her. It commenced at our"
1212,"cousin Colonel Drummond’s; at whose house in Cumberland he spent the"
1212,"Christmas, in which he attained the age of two and twenty. Louisa"
1212,"Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of Mrs. Drummond, who"
1212,"dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty, left his only Child then"
1212,"about eighteen to the protection of any of his Relations who would"
1212,"protect her. Mrs. Drummond was the only one who found herself so"
1212,"disposed—Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable Cottage in"
1212,"Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from every pecuniary"
1212,"Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant Enjoyment that"
1212,"Money could purchase—. Louisa was naturally ill-tempered and Cunning;"
1212,"but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition, under the"
1212,"appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too well knew,"
1212,"that to be married, would be the only chance she would have of not"
1212,"being starved, and who flattered himself that with such an extroidinary"
1212,"share of personal beauty, joined to a gentleness of Manners, and an"
1212,"engaging address, she might stand a good chance of pleasing some young"
1212,"Man who might afford to marry a girl without a Shilling. Louisa"
1212,"perfectly entered into her father’s schemes and was determined to"
1212,"forward them with all her care and attention. By dint of Perseverance"
1212,"and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised her natural"
1212,"disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to impose"
1212,"upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with her"
1212,"discovered her real Character. Such was Louisa when the hapless Lesley"
1212,"first beheld her at Drummond-house. His heart which (to use your"
1212,"favourite comparison) was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a"
1212,"Whipt-syllabub, could not resist her attractions. In a very few Days,"
1212,"he was falling in love, shortly after actually fell, and before he had"
1212,"known her a Month, he had married her. My Father was at first highly"
1212,"displeased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found"
1212,"that they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the"
1212,"match. The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the"
1212,"bounty of his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely"
1212,"sufficient to support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease. For the"
1212,"first twelvemonth, no one could be happier than Lesley, and no one more"
1212,"amiable to appearance than Louisa, and so plausibly did she act and so"
1212,"cautiously behave that tho’ Matilda and I often spent several weeks"
1212,"together with them, yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real"
1212,"Disposition. After the birth of Louisa however, which one would have"
1212,"thought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she had"
1212,"so long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then"
1212,"thought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did"
1212,"indeed appear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she"
1212,"seemed to take no pains to prevent that affection from ever"
1212,"diminushing. Our visits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent"
1212,"and by far less agreable than they used to be. Our absence was however"
1212,"never either mentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of"
1212,"young Danvers with whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at"
1212,"one of the Universities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of"
1212,"Matilda and your freind, tho’ there certainly never were pleasanter"
1212,"girls than we are. You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial"
1212,"happiness; I will not repeat it—. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I"
1212,"have not yet mentioned anything of the matter, I hope you will do me"
1212,"the justice to beleive that I _think_ and _feel_, a great deal for your"
1212,"Sisters affliction. I do not doubt but that the healthy air of the"
1212,"Bristol downs will intirely remove it, by erasing from her Mind the"
1212,"remembrance of Henry. I am my dear Charlotte yrs ever"

1212,"I have but just received your letter, which being directed to Sussex"
1212,"while I was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here, and from"
1212,"some unaccountable Delay, has but this instant reached me—. I return"
1212,"you many thanks for the account it contains of Lesley’s acquaintance,"
1212,"Love and Marriage with Louisa, which has not the less entertained me"
1212,"for having often been repeated to me before."
1212,""
1212,"I have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to"
1212,"imagine our pantry is by this time nearly cleared, as we left"
1212,"Particular orders with the servants to eat as hard as they possibly"
1212,"could, and to call in a couple of Chairwomen to assist them. We brought"
1212,"a cold Pigeon pye, a cold turkey, a cold tongue, and half a dozen"
1212,"Jellies with us, which we were lucky enough with the help of our"
1212,"Landlady, her husband, and their three children, to get rid of, in less"
1212,"than two days after our arrival. Poor Eloisa is still so very"
1212,"indifferent both in Health and Spirits, that I very much fear, the air"
1212,"of the Bristol downs, healthy as it is, has not been able to drive poor"
1212,"Henry from her remembrance."
1212,""
1212,"You ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable—I"
1212,"will now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms."
1212,"She is short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a"
1212,"good deal; has fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let"
1212,"you know as soon as she sees you, and is altogether very pretty. She is"
1212,"remarkably good-tempered when she has her own way, and very lively when"
1212,"she is not out of humour. She is naturally extravagant and not very"
1212,"affected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from"
1212,"me, and never writes anything but her answers to them. She plays, sings"
1212,"and Dances, but has no taste for either, and excells in none, tho’ she"
1212,"says she is passionately fond of all. Perhaps you may flatter me so far"
1212,"as to be surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection"
1212,"should be my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our"
1212,"freindship arose rather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine."
1212,"We spent two or three days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom"
1212,"we both happened to be connected—. During our visit, the Weather being"
1212,"remarkably bad, and our party particularly stupid, she was so good as"
1212,"to conceive a violent partiality for me, which very soon settled in a"
1212,"downright Freindship and ended in an established correspondence. She is"
1212,"probably by this time as tired of me, as I am of her; but as she is too"
1212,"Polite and I am too civil to say so, our letters are still as frequent"
1212,"and affectionate as ever, and our Attachment as firm and sincere as"
1212,"when it first commenced. As she had a great taste for the pleasures of"
1212,"London, and of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some"
1212,"difficulty in prevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I"
1212,"dare say she feels of beholding you, at the expence of quitting those"
1212,"favourite haunts of Dissipation, for the melancholy tho’ venerable"
1212,"gloom of the castle you inhabit. Perhaps however if she finds her"
1212,"health impaired by too much amusement, she may acquire fortitude"
1212,"sufficient to undertake a Journey to Scotland in the hope of its"
1212,"Proving at least beneficial to her health, if not conducive to her"
1212,"happiness. Your fears I am sorry to say, concerning your father’s"
1212,"extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers Jewels and your Sister’s"
1212,"consequence, I should suppose are but too well founded. My freind"
1212,"herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably spend nearly as"
1212,"much every year in Dress and Public places, if she can get it—she will"
1212,"certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the manner of living"
1212,"to which he has been so long accustomed, and there is therefore some"
1212,"reason to fear that you will be very well off, if you get any fortune"
1212,"at all. The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be hers, and"
1212,"there is too much reason to think that she will preside at her Husbands"

1212,"Eloisa’s indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a"

1212,"health of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may"
1212,"imagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are of"
1212,"course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost"
1212,"every day, and dined with them yesterday. We spent a very pleasant Day,"
1212,"and had a very good Dinner, tho’ to be sure the Veal was terribly"
1212,"underdone, and the Curry had no seasoning. I could not help wishing all"
1212,"dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it—. A brother of Mrs"
1212,"Marlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking"
1212,"young Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I tell"
1212,"Eloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all seem"
1212,"to relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and"
1212,"Cleveland has a very good estate. Perhaps you may wonder that I do not"
1212,"consider _myself_ as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but"
1212,"to tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a"
1212,"Wedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner, and therefore"
1212,"while I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me, I shall never"

1212,"On the same day that I received your last kind letter, Matilda received"
1212,"one from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh, and informed us"
1212,"that he should do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us"
1212,"on the following evening. This as you may suppose considerably"
1212,"surprised us, particularly as your account of her Ladyship had given us"
1212,"reason to imagine there was little chance of her visiting Scotland at a"
1212,"time that London must be so gay. As it was our business however to be"
1212,"delighted at such a mark of condescension as a visit from Sir George"
1212,"and Lady Lesley, we prepared to return them an answer expressive of the"
1212,"happiness we enjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing, when luckily"
1212,"recollecting that as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening, it"
1212,"would be impossible for my father to receive it before he left"
1212,"Edinburgh, we contented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we"
1212,"were as happy as we ought to be. At nine in the Evening on the"
1212,"following day, they came, accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers."
1212,"Her Ladyship perfectly answers the description you sent me of her,"
1212,"except that I do not think her so pretty as you seem to consider her."
1212,"She has not a bad face, but there is something so extremely unmajestic"
1212,"in her little diminutive figure, as to render her in comparison with"

1212,"Lesley-Castle March 20th"
1212,""
1212,"We arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already"
1212,"heartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square"
1212,"for such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this. You can form no"
1212,"idea sufficiently hideous, of its dungeon-like form. It is actually"
1212,"perched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible, that I"
1212,"expected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented"
1212,"having gratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of"
1212,"being obliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a"
1212,"manner. But as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside"
1212,"of this tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having"
1212,"my spirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the"
1212,"Miss Lesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh. But here again,"
1212,"I met with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise. Matilda and"
1212,"Margaret Lesley are two great, tall, out of the way, over-grown, girls,"
1212,"just of a proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison"
1212,"as themselves. I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these"
1212,"Scotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits. They"
1212,"will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to"
1212,"accompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight."
1212,"Besides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who"
1212,"I beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave"
1212,"me a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss _Somebody_ which I"
1212,"have entirely forgot. I hate scandal and detest Children. I have been"
1212,"plagued ever since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of"
1212,"Scotch wretches, with terrible hard-names; they were so civil, gave me"
1212,"so many invitations, and talked of coming again so soon, that I could"
1212,"not help affronting them. I suppose I shall not see them any more, and"
1212,"yet as a family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do"
1212,"with myself. These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no Drawings"
1212,"but Scotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems—and I hate"
1212,"everything Scotch. In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett"
1212,"with a great deal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there"
1212,"is not a creature in the House whom I have any wish to please. I have"
1212,"just had a conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly"
1212,"offended me, and which as I have nothing more entertaining to send you"
1212,"I will gave you the particulars of. You must know that I have for these"
1212,"4 or 5 Days past strongly suspected William of entertaining a"
1212,"partiality to my eldest Daughter. I own indeed that had _I_ been"
1212,"inclined to fall in love with any woman, I should not have made choice"
1212,"of Matilda Lesley for the object of my passion; for there is nothing I"
1212,"hate so much as a tall Woman: but however there is no accounting for"
1212,"some men’s taste and as William is himself nearly six feet high, it is"
1212,"not wonderful that he should be partial to that height. Now as I have a"
1212,"very great affection for my Brother and should be extremely sorry to"
1212,"see him unhappy, which I suppose he means to be if he cannot marry"
1212,"Matilda, as moreover I know that his circumstances will not allow him"
1212,"to marry any one without a fortune, and that Matilda’s is entirely"
1212,"dependant on her Father, who will neither have his own inclination nor"
1212,"my permission to give her anything at present, I thought it would be"
1212,"doing a good-natured action by my Brother to let him know as much, in"
1212,"order that he might choose for himself, whether to conquer his passion,"
1212,"or Love and Despair. Accordingly finding myself this Morning alone with"
1212,"him in one of the horrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause"
1212,"to him in the following Manner."
1212,""
1212,"“Well my dear William what do you think of these girls? for my part, I"
1212,"do not find them so plain as I expected: but perhaps you may think me"
1212,"partial to the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right—They"
1212,"are indeed so very like Sir George that it is natural to think”—"
1212,""
1212,"“My Dear Susan (cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement) You do"
1212,"not really think they bear the least resemblance to their Father! He is"
1212,"so very plain!—but I beg your pardon—I had entirely forgotten to whom I"
1212,"was speaking—”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! pray dont mind me; (replied I) every one knows Sir George is"
1212,"horribly ugly, and I assure you I always thought him a fright.”"
1212,""
1212,"“You surprise me extremely (answered William) by what you say both with"
1212,"respect to Sir George and his Daughters. You cannot think your Husband"
1212,"so deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see"
1212,"any resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion"
1212,"perfectly unlike him and perfectly Handsome.”"
1212,""
1212,"“If that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no"
1212,"proof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and"
1212,"very handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is"
1212,"very plain.”"
1212,""
1212,"“By no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very"
1212,"unpleasing in a Man.”"

1212,"“But you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be"
1212,"very plain.”"

1212,"“Men are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex.” (said he)."
1212,""
1212,"“Neither Men nor Women can think Sir George tolerable.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Well, well, (said he) we will not dispute about _his_ Beauty, but your"
1212,"opinion of his _Daughters_ is surely very singular, for if I understood"
1212,"you right, you said you did not find them so plain as you expected to"
1212,"do!”"
1212,""
1212,"“Why, do _you_ find them plainer then?” (said I)."
1212,""
1212,"“I can scarcely beleive you to be serious (returned he) when you speak"
1212,"of their persons in so extroidinary a Manner. Do not you think the Miss"
1212,"Lesleys are two very handsome young Women?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Lord! No! (cried I) I think them terribly plain!”"
1212,""
1212,"“Plain! (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot really think so! Why"
1212,"what single Feature in the face of either of them, can you possibly"
1212,"find fault with?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! trust me for that; (replied I). Come I will begin with the"
1212,"eldest—with Matilda. Shall I, William?” (I looked as cunning as I could"
1212,"when I said it, in order to shame him)."
1212,""
1212,"“They are so much alike (said he) that I should suppose the faults of"
1212,"one, would be the faults of both.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Well, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall!”"
1212,""
1212,"“They are _taller_ than you are indeed.” (said he with a saucy smile.)"
1212,""
1212,"“Nay, (said I), I know nothing of that.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Well, but (he continued) tho’ they may be above the common size, their"
1212,"figures are perfectly elegant; and as to their faces, their Eyes are"
1212,"beautifull.”"
1212,""
1212,"“I never can think such tremendous, knock-me-down figures in the least"
1212,"degree elegant, and as for their eyes, they are so tall that I never"
1212,"could strain my neck enough to look at them.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Nay, (replied he) I know not whether you may not be in the right in"
1212,"not attempting it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their"
1212,"Lustre.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! Certainly. (said I, with the greatest complacency, for I assure"
1212,"you my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho’ by what"
1212,"followed, one would suppose that William was conscious of having given"
1212,"me just cause to be so, for coming up to me and taking my hand, he"
1212,"said) “You must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have"

1212,"“Offended me! Dear Brother, how came such a thought in your head!"

1212,"girls.”—"
1212,""
1212,"“Well, but (interrupted William) remember that we have not yet"
1212,"concluded our dispute concerning them. What fault do you find with"
1212,"their complexion?”"
1212,""
1212,"“They are so horridly pale.”"
1212,""
1212,"“They have always a little colour, and after any exercise it is"

1212,"“Yes, but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of"
1212,"the world, they will never be able raise more than their common"

1212,"these horrid old galleries and Antichambers.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Well, (replied my Brother in a tone of vexation, and glancing an"
1212,"impertinent look at me) if they _have_ but little colour, at least, it"

1212,""
1212,""
1212,"Bristol the 27th of March"
1212,""
1212,"I have received Letters from you and your Mother-in-law within this"
1212,"week which have greatly entertained me, as I find by them that you are"
1212,"both downright jealous of each others Beauty. It is very odd that two"
1212,"pretty Women tho’ actually Mother and Daughter cannot be in the same"
1212,"House without falling out about their faces. Do be convinced that you"
1212,"are both perfectly handsome and say no more of the Matter. I suppose"
1212,"this letter must be directed to Portman Square where probably (great as"
1212,"is your affection for Lesley Castle) you will not be sorry to find"
1212,"yourself. In spite of all that people may say about Green fields and"
1212,"the Country I was always of opinion that London and its amusements must"
1212,"be very agreable for a while, and should be very happy could my"
1212,"Mother’s income allow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during"
1212,"Winter. I always longed particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether"
1212,"the cold Beef there is cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly"
1212,"suspicion that few people understand the art of cutting a slice of cold"
1212,"Beef so well as I do: nay it would be hard if I did not know something"
1212,"of the Matter, for it was a part of my Education that I took by far the"
1212,"most pains with. Mama always found me _her_ best scholar, tho’ when"
1212,"Papa was alive Eloisa was _his_. Never to be sure were there two more"
1212,"different Dispositions in the World. We both loved Reading. _She_"
1212,"preferred Histories, and I Receipts. She loved drawing, Pictures, and I"
1212,"drawing Pullets. No one could sing a better song than she, and no one"
1212,"make a better Pye than I.—And so it has always continued since we have"
1212,"been no longer children. The only difference is that all disputes on"
1212,"the superior excellence of our Employments _then_ so frequent are now"
1212,"no more. We have for many years entered into an agreement always to"
1212,"admire each other’s works; I never fail listening to _her_ Music, and"
1212,"she is as constant in eating my pies. Such at least was the case till"
1212,"Henry Hervey made his appearance in Sussex. Before the arrival of his"
1212,"Aunt in our neighbourhood where she established herself you know about"
1212,"a twelvemonth ago, his visits to her had been at stated times, and of"
1212,"equal and settled Duration; but on her removal to the Hall which is"
1212,"within a walk from our House, they became both more frequent and"
1212,"longer. This as you may suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs Diana who"
1212,"is a professed enemy to everything which is not directed by Decorum and"
1212,"Formality, or which bears the least resemblance to Ease and"
1212,"Good-breeding. Nay so great was her aversion to her Nephews behaviour"
1212,"that I have often heard her give such hints of it before his face that"
1212,"had not Henry at such times been engaged in conversation with Eloisa,"
1212,"they must have caught his Attention and have very much distressed him."
1212,"The alteration in my Sisters behaviour which I have before hinted at,"
1212,"now took place. The Agreement we had entered into of admiring each"
1212,"others productions she no longer seemed to regard, and tho’ I"
1212,"constantly applauded even every Country-dance, she played, yet not even"
1212,"a pidgeon-pye of my making could obtain from her a single word of"
1212,"approbation. This was certainly enough to put any one in a Passion;"
1212,"however, I was as cool as a cream-cheese and having formed my plan and"
1212,"concerted a scheme of Revenge, I was determined to let her have her own"
1212,"way and not even to make her a single reproach. My scheme was to treat"
1212,"her as she treated me, and tho’ she might even draw my own Picture or"
1212,"play Malbrook (which is the only tune I ever really liked) not to say"
1212,"so much as “Thank you Eloisa;” tho’ I had for many years constantly"
1212,"hollowed whenever she played, _Bravo_, _Bravissimo_, _her_, _Da capo_,"
1212,"_allegretto con expressione_, and _Poco presto_ with many other such"
1212,"outlandish words, all of them as Eloisa told me expressive of my"
1212,"Admiration; and so indeed I suppose they are, as I see some of them in"
1212,"every Page of every Music book, being the sentiments I imagine of the"
1212,"composer."
1212,""
1212,"I executed my Plan with great Punctuality. I can not say success, for"
1212,"alas! my silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease"
1212,"her; on the contrary she actually said to me one day “Well Charlotte, I"
1212,"am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous"
1212,"custom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made _my_"
1212,"head ake, and yourself hoarse. I feel very much obliged to you for"
1212,"keeping your admiration to yourself.” I never shall forget the very"
1212,"witty answer I made to this speech. “Eloisa (said I) I beg you would be"
1212,"quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future, for be"
1212,"assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own"
1212,"pursuits and never extend it to yours.” This was the only very severe"
1212,"thing I ever said in my Life; not but that I have often felt myself"
1212,"extremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings"
1212,"public."
1212,""
1212,"I suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection"
1212,"for each other than Henry and Eloisa; no, the Love of your Brother for"
1212,"Miss Burton could not be so strong tho’ it might be more violent. You"
1212,"may imagine therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have him"
1212,"play her such a trick. Poor girl! she still laments his Death with"
1212,"undiminished constancy, notwithstanding he has been dead more than six"
1212,"weeks; but some People mind such things more than others. The ill state"
1212,"of Health into which his loss has thrown her makes her so weak, and so"
1212,"unable to support the least exertion, that she has been in tears all"
1212,"this Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs. Marlowe who with"
1212,"her Husband, Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this morning. I am"
1212,"sorry to have them go because they are the only family with whom we"
1212,"have here any acquaintance, but I never thought of crying; to be sure"
1212,"Eloisa and Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me, and"
1212,"have therefore contracted a kind of affection for each other, which"
1212,"does not make Tears so inexcusable in them as they would be in me. The"
1212,"Marlowes are going to Town; Cliveland accompanies them; as neither"
1212,"Eloisa nor I could catch him I hope you or Matilda may have better"
1212,"Luck. I know not when we shall leave Bristol, Eloisa’s spirits are so"

1212,"other person) independant of my sister would never be an object of my"
1212,"wishes, but how much was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by"
1212,"two confidential correspondents of that sort, to supply the place of"
1212,"one to me, and I hope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I"
1212,"say that to have some kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to"
1212,"my sorrows without endeavouring to console me was what I had for some"
1212,"time wished for, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which"
1212,"followed it and the particular affectionate attention you paid me"
1212,"almost from the first, caused me to entertain the flattering Idea of"
1212,"those attentions being improved on a closer acquaintance into a"
1212,"Freindship which, if you were what my wishes formed you would be the"
1212,"greatest Happiness I could be capable of enjoying. To find that such"
1212,"Hopes are realised is a satisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is"
1212,"now almost the only one I can ever experience.—I feel myself so languid"
1212,"that I am sure were you with me you would oblige me to leave off"
1212,"writing, and I cannot give you a greater proof of my affection for you"
1212,"than by acting, as I know you would wish me to do, whether Absent or"

1212,"Need I say my dear Eloisa how wellcome your letter was to me I cannot"
1212,"give a greater proof of the pleasure I received from it, or of the"
1212,"Desire I feel that our Correspondence may be regular and frequent than"
1212,"by setting you so good an example as I now do in answering it before"
1212,"the end of the week—. But do not imagine that I claim any merit in"
1212,"being so punctual; on the contrary I assure you, that it is a far"
1212,"greater Gratification to me to write to you, than to spend the Evening"
1212,"either at a Concert or a Ball. Mr Marlowe is so desirous of my"
1212,"appearing at some of the Public places every evening that I do not like"
1212,"to refuse him, but at the same time so much wish to remain at Home,"
1212,"that independant of the Pleasure I experience in devoting any portion"
1212,"of my Time to my Dear Eloisa, yet the Liberty I claim from having a"
1212,"letter to write of spending an Evening at home with my little Boy, you"
1212,"know me well enough to be sensible, will of itself be a sufficient"
1212,"Inducement (if one is necessary) to my maintaining with Pleasure a"
1212,"Correspondence with you. As to the subject of your letters to me,"
1212,"whether grave or merry, if they concern you they must be equally"
1212,"interesting to me; not but that I think the melancholy Indulgence of"
1212,"your own sorrows by repeating them and dwelling on them to me, will"
1212,"only encourage and increase them, and that it will be more prudent in"
1212,"you to avoid so sad a subject; but yet knowing as I do what a soothing"
1212,"and melancholy Pleasure it must afford you, I cannot prevail on myself"
1212,"to deny you so great an Indulgence, and will only insist on your not"
1212,"expecting me to encourage you in it, by my own letters; on the contrary"
1212,"I intend to fill them with such lively Wit and enlivening Humour as"
1212,"shall even provoke a smile in the sweet but sorrowfull countenance of"

1212,"In the first place you are to learn that I have met your sisters three"
1212,"freinds Lady Lesley and her Daughters, twice in Public since I have"
1212,"been here. I know you will be impatient to hear my opinion of the"
1212,"Beauty of three Ladies of whom you have heard so much. Now, as you are"
1212,"too ill and too unhappy to be vain, I think I may venture to inform you"
1212,"that I like none of their faces so well as I do your own. Yet they are"
1212,"all handsome—Lady Lesley indeed I have seen before; her Daughters I"
1212,"beleive would in general be said to have a finer face than her"
1212,"Ladyship, and yet what with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a"
1212,"little Affectation and a great deal of small-talk, (in each of which"
1212,"she is superior to the young Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself"
1212,"as many admirers as the more regular features of Matilda, and Margaret."
1212,"I am sure you will agree with me in saying that they can none of them"
1212,"be of a proper size for real Beauty, when you know that two of them are"
1212,"taller and the other shorter than ourselves. In spite of this Defect"
1212,"(or rather by reason of it) there is something very noble and majestic"
1212,"in the figures of the Miss Lesleys, and something agreably lively in"
1212,"the appearance of their pretty little Mother-in-law. But tho’ one may"
1212,"be majestic and the other lively, yet the faces of neither possess that"
1212,"Bewitching sweetness of my Eloisas, which her present languor is so far"
1212,"from diminushing. What would my Husband and Brother say of us, if they"
1212,"knew all the fine things I have been saying to you in this letter. It"
1212,"is very hard that a pretty woman is never to be told she is so by any"
1212,"one of her own sex without that person’s being suspected to be either"
1212,"her determined Enemy, or her professed Toad-eater. How much more"
1212,"amiable are women in that particular! One man may say forty civil"
1212,"things to another without our supposing that he is ever paid for it,"

1212,"Portman Square April 13th"
1212,""
1212,"MY DEAR CHARLOTTE"
1212,""
1212,"We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month, and arrived safely in"
1212,"London after a Journey of seven Days; I had the pleasure of finding"
1212,"your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you have my grateful"
1212,"Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I every day more regret the serene and"
1212,"tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange for the"
1212,"uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City. Not that I will"
1212,"pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements are in"
1212,"the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them"
1212,"extremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that"
1212,"every appearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those"
1212,"unhappy Beings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho’ it is"
1212,"out of my power to return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my"
1212,"sensibility for the sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike"
1212,"of the extreme admiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so"
1212,"celebrated both in Public, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops,"
1212,"that are the reasons why I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so"
1212,"various and pleasing of London. How often have I wished that I"
1212,"possessed as little Personal Beauty as you do; that my figure were as"
1212,"inelegant; my face as unlovely; and my appearance as unpleasing as"
1212,"yours! But ah! what little chance is there of so desirable an Event; I"
1212,"have had the small-pox, and must therefore submit to my unhappy fate."
1212,""
1212,"I am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has"
1212,"long disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to"
1212,"require the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se’night"
1212,"Matilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs"
1212,"Kickabout’s; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable"
1212,"young Man in the main, tho’ perhaps a little singular in his Taste—He"
1212,"is in love with Matilda—. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the"
1212,"Lady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when"
1212,"my Attention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most"
1212,"lovely of his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another"
1212,"Gentleman and Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain"
1212,"that on him depended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my"
1212,"surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of Cleveland—I"
1212,"instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the"
1212,"acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the"
1212,"gentleman and Lady who accompanied him. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe"
1212,"handsome?) The elegant address of Mr Cleveland, his polished Manners"
1212,"and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my attachment. He did not speak;"
1212,"but I can imagine everything he would have said, had he opened his"
1212,"Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated Understanding, the Noble"
1212,"sentiments, and elegant Language which would have shone so conspicuous"
1212,"in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The approach of Sir James Gower"
1212,"(one of my too numerous admirers) prevented the Discovery of any such"
1212,"Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we had never commenced, and"
1212,"by attracting my attention to himself. But oh! how inferior are the"
1212,"accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so greatly envied Rival!"
1212,"Sir James is one of the most frequent of our Visitors, and is almost"
1212,"always of our Parties. We have since often met Mr and Mrs Marlowe but"
1212,"no Cleveland—he is always engaged some where else. Mrs Marlowe fatigues"
1212,"me to Death every time I see her by her tiresome Conversations about"
1212,"you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in the hope of seeing her"
1212,"irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to Lady Flambeaus, who"
1212,"is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will be Lady Lesley,"
1212,"Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see little of Sir"
1212,"George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my poor Fortune"
1212,"where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who always makes"
1212,"her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what Delightful"
1212,"Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau’s! Yet I"
1212,"wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she must be"
1212,"sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little diminutive"
1212,"figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that she can not"
1212,"know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the most studied"
1212,"apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how greatly"
1212,"should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on our fine"
1212,"majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea should"
1212,"never have occurred to _her_. I am sure if I have reflected in this"
1212,"manner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in"
1212,"them such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother’s"
1212,"Jewels too! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject—let me"
1212,"entertain you with something more pleasing—Matilda had a letter this"
1212,"morning from Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he"
1212,"is at Naples has turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope’s"
1212,"Bulls for annulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a"
1212,"Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that"
1212,"much the same sort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless"
1212,"Louisa who is likewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon"
1212,"to be married to a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished"
1212,"merit. He says, that they are at present very good Freinds, have quite"
1212,"forgiven all past errors and intend in future to be very good"
1212,"Neighbours. He invites Matilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and"
1212,"to bring him his little Louisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and"
1212,"himself are equally desirous of beholding. As to our accepting his"
1212,"invitation, it is at Present very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to"
1212,"go without loss of time; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but"
1212,"Matilda has some doubts of the Propriety of such a scheme—she owns it"
1212,"would be very agreable. I am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father"
1212,"desires us not to be in a hurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months"
1212,"both he and Lady Lesley will do themselves the pleasure of attending"
1212,"us. Lady Lesley says no, that nothing will ever tempt her to forego the"
1212,"Amusements of Brighthelmstone for a Journey to Italy merely to see our"
1212,"Brother. “No (says the disagreable Woman) I have once in my life been"
1212,"fool enough to travel I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of"
1212,"the Family, and I found it did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I"
1212,"am so foolish again.” So says her Ladyship, but Sir George still"
1212,"Perseveres in saying that perhaps in a month or two, they may accompany"
1212,"us."

1212,"wife. Be this as it may, he did not live for ever, but falling ill, his"

1212,"King made a long speech, for which I must refer the Reader to"

1212,"Sir William again. During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt alive, but I"
1212,"forget what for. His Majesty then turned his thoughts to France, where"
1212,"he went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt. He afterwards"
1212,"married the King’s daughter Catherine, a very agreable woman by"
1212,"Shakespear’s account. In spite of all this however he died, and was"

1212,"I cannot say much for this Monarch’s sense. Nor would I if I could, for"
1212,"he was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars between him"
1212,"and the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had"
1212,"better read some other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in"
1212,"this, meaning by it only to vent my spleen _against_, and shew my"
1212,"Hatred _to_ all those people whose parties or principles do not suit"
1212,"with mine, and not to give information. This King married Margaret of"
1212,"Anjou, a Woman whose distresses and misfortunes were so great as almost"
1212,"to make me who hate her, pity her. It was in this reign that Joan of"
1212,"Arc lived and made such a _row_ among the English. They should not have"
1212,"burnt her—but they did. There were several Battles between the Yorkists"
1212,"and Lancastrians, in which the former (as they ought) usually"
1212,"conquered. At length they were entirely overcome; The King was"
1212,"murdered—The Queen was sent home—and Edward the 4th ascended the"

1212,"the Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour in"
1212,"marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient"
1212,"proofs. His Wife was Elizabeth Woodville, a Widow who, poor Woman! was"
1212,"afterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and"
1212,"Avarice Henry the 7th. One of Edward’s Mistresses was Jane Shore, who"

1212,"The Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated"
1212,"by Historians, but as he was a _York_, I am rather inclined to suppose"
1212,"him a very respectable Man. It has indeed been confidently asserted"
1212,"that he killed his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also been"
1212,"declared that he did _not_ kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to"
1212,"beleive true; and if this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he"
1212,"did not kill his Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of"
1212,"York, why might not Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard. Whether"
1212,"innocent or guilty, he did not reign long in peace, for Henry Tudor E."
1212,"of Richmond as great a villain as ever lived, made a great fuss about"

1212,"inferior to hers, tho’ he pretended to the contrary. By this Marriage"
1212,"he had two sons and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was"
1212,"married to the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being"
1212,"grandmother to one of the first Characters in the World. But of _her_,"
1212,"I shall have occasion to speak more at large in future. The youngest,"
1212,"Mary, married first the King of France and secondly the D. of Suffolk,"
1212,"by whom she had one daughter, afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey,"
1212,"who tho’ inferior to her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an"
1212,"amiable young woman and famous for reading Greek while other people"
1212,"were hunting. It was in the reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck"
1212,"and Lambert Simnel before mentioned made their appearance, the former"
1212,"of whom was set in the stocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was"
1212,"beheaded with the Earl of Warwick, and the latter was taken into the"
1212,"Kings kitchen. His Majesty died and was succeeded by his son Henry"
1212,"whose only merit was his not being _quite_ so bad as his daughter"

1212,"It would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were"
1212,"not as well acquainted with the particulars of this King’s reign as I"
1212,"am myself. It will therefore be saving _them_ the task of reading again"
1212,"what they have read before, and _myself_ the trouble of writing what I"
1212,"do not perfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the"
1212,"principal Events which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked"
1212,"Cardinal Wolsey’s telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that “he"
1212,"was come to lay his bones among them,” the reformation in Religion and"
1212,"the King’s riding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is"
1212,"however but Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was"
1212,"entirely innocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of"
1212,"which her Beauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient"
1212,"proofs, not to mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the"
1212,"weakness of the Charges against her, and the King’s Character; all of"
1212,"which add some confirmation, tho’ perhaps but slight ones when in"
1212,"comparison with those before alledged in her favour. Tho’ I do not"
1212,"profess giving many dates, yet as I think it proper to give some and"
1212,"shall of course make choice of those which it is most necessary for the"
1212,"Reader to know, I think it right to inform him that her letter to the"
1212,"King was dated on the 6th of May. The Crimes and Cruelties of this"
1212,"Prince, were too numerous to be mentioned, (as this history I trust has"
1212,"fully shown;) and nothing can be said in his vindication, but that his"
1212,"abolishing Religious Houses and leaving them to the ruinous"
1212,"depredations of time has been of infinite use to the landscape of"
1212,"England in general, which probably was a principal motive for his doing"
1212,"it, since otherwise why should a Man who was of no Religion himself be"
1212,"at so much trouble to abolish one which had for ages been established"
1212,"in the Kingdom. His Majesty’s 5th Wife was the Duke of Norfolk’s Neice"
1212,"who, tho’ universally acquitted of the crimes for which she was"
1212,"beheaded, has been by many people supposed to have led an abandoned"
1212,"life before her Marriage—of this however I have many doubts, since she"
1212,"was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the"
1212,"Queen of Scotland’s cause, and who at last fell a victim to it. The"
1212,"Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with difficulty effected"
1212,"it. He was succeeded by his only son Edward."

1212,"Duke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority."
1212,"This Man was on the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat"
1212,"of a favourite with me, tho’ I would by no means pretend to affirm that"
1212,"he was equal to those first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or"
1212,"Gilpin. He was beheaded, of which he might with reason have been proud,"
1212,"had he known that such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but as"
1212,"it was impossible that he should be conscious of what had never"
1212,"happened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with"
1212,"the manner of it. After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had the"
1212,"care of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of both so"
1212,"well that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his daughter in law"
1212,"the Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading Greek."
1212,"Whether she really understood that language or whether such a study"
1212,"proceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was"
1212,"always rather remarkable, is uncertain. Whatever might be the cause,"
1212,"she preserved the same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what"
1212,"was generally esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for she"
1212,"declared herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while"
1212,"conducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another"
1212,"in Greek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally passing"
1212,"that way."

1212,"This woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of"
1212,"England, in spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of her"
1212,"Cousins Mary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity the"
1212,"Kingdom for the misfortunes they experienced during her Reign, since"
1212,"they fully deserved them, for having allowed her to succeed her"
1212,"Brother—which was a double peice of folly, since they might have"
1212,"foreseen that as she died without children, she would be succeeded by"
1212,"that disgrace to humanity, that pest of society, Elizabeth. Many were"
1212,"the people who fell martyrs to the protestant Religion during her"
1212,"reign; I suppose not fewer than a dozen. She married Philip King of"
1212,"Spain who in her sister’s reign was famous for building Armadas. She"
1212,"died without issue, and then the dreadful moment came in which the"
1212,"destroyer of all comfort, the deceitful Betrayer of trust reposed in"
1212,"her, and the Murderess of her Cousin succeeded to the Throne.——"

1212,"It was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad"
1212,"Ministers—Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have committed"
1212,"such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men connived"
1212,"at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by many people"
1212,"been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis Walsingham,"
1212,"and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State were"
1212,"deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh! how blinded such"
1212,"writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit despised,"
1212,"neglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they"
1212,"reflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their"
1212,"Country and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining"
1212,"for the space of nineteen years, a _Woman_ who if the claims of"
1212,"Relationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who"
1212,"condescended to place confidence in her, had every reason to expect"
1212,"assistance and protection; and at length in allowing Elizabeth to bring"
1212,"this amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and scandalous Death. Can"
1212,"any one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot, this everlasting"
1212,"blot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any praise to"
1212,"Lord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham? Oh! what must this bewitching"
1212,"Princess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose only"
1212,"ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was"
1212,"abandoned by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and"
1212,"vilified by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when"
1212,"informed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore it"
1212,"with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her"
1212,"Religion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she was"
1212,"doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from conscious"
1212,"Innocence. And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible that some"
1212,"hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that"
1212,"steadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so much"
1212,"credit? But this is a striking proof of _their_ narrow souls and"
1212,"prejudiced Judgements who accuse her. She was executed in the Great"
1212,"Hall at Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of"
1212,"February 1586—to the everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers,"
1212,"and of England in general. It may not be unnecessary before I entirely"
1212,"conclude my account of this ill-fated Queen, to observe that she had"
1212,"been accused of several crimes during the time of her reigning in"
1212,"Scotland, of which I now most seriously do assure my Reader that she"
1212,"was entirely innocent; having never been guilty of anything more than"
1212,"Imprudencies into which she was betrayed by the openness of her Heart,"
1212,"her Youth, and her Education. Having I trust by this assurance entirely"
1212,"done away every Suspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in"
1212,"the Reader’s mind, from what other Historians have written of her, I"
1212,"shall proceed to mention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth’s"
1212,"reign. It was about this time that Sir Francis Drake the first English"
1212,"Navigator who sailed round the World, lived, to be the ornament of his"
1212,"Country and his profession. Yet great as he was, and justly celebrated"
1212,"as a sailor, I cannot help foreseeing that he will be equalled in this"
1212,"or the next Century by one who tho’ now but young, already promises to"
1212,"answer all the ardent and sanguine expectations of his Relations and"
1212,"Freinds, amongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom this work is"
1212,"dedicated, and my no less amiable self."
1212,""
1212,"Though of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere of"
1212,"Life, yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an _Earl_, as Drake"
1212,"was in that of a _Sailor_, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex. This"
1212,"unfortunate young Man was not unlike in character to that equally"
1212,"unfortunate one _Frederic Delamere_. The simile may be carried still"
1212,"farther, and Elizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the"
1212,"Emmeline of Delamere. It would be endless to recount the misfortunes of"
1212,"this noble and gallant Earl. It is sufficient to say that he was"
1212,"beheaded on the 25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of"
1212,"Ireland, after having clapped his hand on his sword, and after"
1212,"performing many other services to his Country. Elizabeth did not long"
1212,"survive his loss, and died so miserable that were it not an injury to"
1212,"the memory of Mary I should pity her."

1212,"Though this King had some faults, among which and as the most"
1212,"principal, was his allowing his Mother’s death, yet considered on the"
1212,"whole I cannot help liking him. He married Anne of Denmark, and had"
1212,"several Children; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died"
1212,"before his father or he might have experienced the evils which befell"
1212,"his unfortunate Brother."
1212,""
1212,"As I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with"
1212,"infinite regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any Member"
1212,"of it: yet Truth being I think very excusable in an Historian, I am"
1212,"necessitated to say that in this reign the roman Catholics of England"
1212,"did not behave like Gentlemen to the protestants. Their Behaviour"
1212,"indeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of Parliament might justly"
1212,"be considered by them as very uncivil, and even Sir Henry Percy tho’"
1212,"certainly the best bred man of the party, had none of that general"
1212,"politeness which is so universally pleasing, as his attentions were"
1212,"entirely confined to Lord Mounteagle."
1212,""
1212,"Sir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and is"
1212,"by many people held in great veneration and respect—But as he was an"
1212,"enemy of the noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of him, and"
1212,"must refer all those who may wish to be acquainted with the particulars"
1212,"of his life, to Mr Sheridan’s play of the Critic, where they will find"
1212,"many interesting anecdotes as well of him as of his friend Sir"
1212,"Christopher Hatton.—His Majesty was of that amiable disposition which"
1212,"inclines to Freindship, and in such points was possessed of a keener"
1212,"penetration in discovering Merit than many other people. I once heard"
1212,"an excellent Sharade on a Carpet, of which the subject I am now on"
1212,"reminds me, and as I think it may afford my Readers some amusement to"
1212,"_find it out_, I shall here take the liberty of presenting it to them."

1212,"created Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share in"
1212,"the above mentioned Sharade, and George Villiers afterwards Duke of"

1212,"This amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to"
1212,"those of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve"
1212,"since he was her descendant. Never certainly were there before so many"
1212,"detestable Characters at one time in England as in this Period of its"
1212,"History; never were amiable men so scarce. The number of them"
1212,"throughout the whole Kingdom amounting only to _five_, besides the"
1212,"inhabitants of Oxford who were always loyal to their King and faithful"
1212,"to his interests. The names of this noble five who never forgot the"
1212,"duty of the subject, or swerved from their attachment to his Majesty,"
1212,"were as follows—The King himself, ever stedfast in his own"
1212,"support—Archbishop Laud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke"
1212,"of Ormond, who were scarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause."
1212,"While the _villains_ of the time would make too long a list to be"
1212,"written or read; I shall therefore content myself with mentioning the"
1212,"leaders of the Gang. Cromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be"
1212,"considered as the original Causers of all the disturbances, Distresses,"
1212,"and Civil Wars in which England for many years was embroiled. In this"
1212,"reign as well as in that of Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my"
1212,"attachment to the Scotch, to consider them as equally guilty with the"
1212,"generality of the English, since they dared to think differently from"
1212,"their Sovereign, to forget the Adoration which as _Stuarts_ it was"
1212,"their Duty to pay them, to rebel against, dethrone and imprison the"
1212,"unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to deceive, and to sell the no less"
1212,"unfortunate Charles. The Events of this Monarch’s reign are too"
1212,"numerous for my pen, and indeed the recital of any Events (except what"
1212,"I make myself) is uninteresting to me; my principal reason for"
1212,"undertaking the History of England being to Prove the innocence of the"
1212,"Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself with having effectually done,"
1212,"and to abuse Elizabeth, tho’ I am rather fearful of having fallen short"
1212,"in the latter part of my scheme.—As therefore it is not my intention to"
1212,"give any particular account of the distresses into which this King was"
1212,"involved through the misconduct and Cruelty of his Parliament, I shall"
1212,"satisfy myself with vindicating him from the Reproach of Arbitrary and"
1212,"tyrannical Government with which he has often been charged. This, I"
1212,"feel, is not difficult to be done, for with one argument I am certain"
1212,"of satisfying every sensible and well disposed person whose opinions"
1212,"have been properly guided by a good Education—and this Argument is that"
1212,"he was a STUART."

1212,"My Children begin now to claim all my attention in different Manner"
1212,"from that in which they have been used to receive it, as they are now"
1212,"arrived at that age when it is necessary for them in some measure to"
1212,"become conversant with the World, My Augusta is 17 and her sister"
1212,"scarcely a twelvemonth younger. I flatter myself that their education"
1212,"has been such as will not disgrace their appearance in the World, and"
1212,"that _they_ will not disgrace their Education I have every reason to"
1212,"beleive. Indeed they are sweet Girls—. Sensible yet"
1212,"unaffected—Accomplished yet Easy—. Lively yet Gentle—. As their"
1212,"progress in every thing they have learnt has been always the same, I am"
1212,"willing to forget the difference of age, and to introduce them together"
1212,"into Public. This very Evening is fixed on as their first _entrée_ into"
1212,"Life, as we are to drink tea with Mrs Cope and her Daughter. I am glad"
1212,"that we are to meet no one, for my Girls sake, as it would be awkward"
1212,"for them to enter too wide a Circle on the very first day. But we shall"
1212,"proceed by degrees.—Tomorrow Mr Stanly’s family will drink tea with us,"
1212,"and perhaps the Miss Phillips’s will meet them. On Tuesday we shall pay"
1212,"Morning Visits—On Wednesday we are to dine at Westbrook. On Thursday we"

1212,"This mighty affair is now happily over, and my Girls _are out_. As the"
1212,"moment approached for our departure, you can have no idea how the sweet"
1212,"Creatures trembled with fear and expectation. Before the Carriage drove"
1212,"to the door, I called them into my dressing-room, and as soon as they"
1212,"were seated thus addressed them. “My dear Girls the moment is now"
1212,"arrived when I am to reap the rewards of all my Anxieties and Labours"
1212,"towards you during your Education. You are this Evening to enter a"
1212,"World in which you will meet with many wonderfull Things; Yet let me"
1212,"warn you against suffering yourselves to be meanly swayed by the"
1212,"Follies and Vices of others, for beleive me my beloved Children that if"
1212,"you do—I shall be very sorry for it.” They both assured me that they"
1212,"would ever remember my advice with Gratitude, and follow it with"
1212,"attention; That they were prepared to find a World full of things to"
1212,"amaze and to shock them: but that they trusted their behaviour would"
1212,"never give me reason to repent the Watchful Care with which I had"
1212,"presided over their infancy and formed their Minds—” “With such"
1212,"expectations and such intentions (cried I) I can have nothing to fear"
1212,"from you—and can chearfully conduct you to Mrs Cope’s without a fear of"
1212,"your being seduced by her Example, or contaminated by her Follies."
1212,"Come, then my Children (added I) the Carriage is driving to the door,"
1212,"and I will not a moment delay the happiness you are so impatient to"
1212,"enjoy.” When we arrived at Warleigh, poor Augusta could scarcely"
1212,"breathe, while Margaret was all Life and Rapture. “The long-expected"
1212,"Moment is now arrived (said she) and we shall soon be in the World.”—In"
1212,"a few Moments we were in Mrs Cope’s parlour, where with her daughter"
1212,"she sate ready to receive us. I observed with delight the impression my"
1212,"Children made on them—. They were indeed two sweet, elegant-looking"
1212,"Girls, and tho’ somewhat abashed from the peculiarity of their"
1212,"situation, yet there was an ease in their Manners and address which"
1212,"could not fail of pleasing—. Imagine my dear Madam how delighted I must"
1212,"have been in beholding as I did, how attentively they observed every"
1212,"object they saw, how disgusted with some Things, how enchanted with"
1212,"others, how astonished at all! On the whole however they returned in"

1212,"Friday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning, and with her, her sweet"
1212,"sister Miss Jane—. Although I have been acquainted with this charming"
1212,"Woman above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she"
1212,"is. She is now about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is"
1212,"more blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her,"
1212,"the moment she entered the house, and she appeared equally pleased with"
1212,"me, attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day. There is"
1212,"something so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more"
1212,"than Mortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I"
1212,"could not help telling her how much she engaged my admiration—. “Oh!"
1212,"Miss Jane (said I)—and stopped from an inability at the moment of"
1212,"expressing myself as I could wish—Oh! Miss Jane—(I repeated)—I could"
1212,"not think of words to suit my feelings—She seemed waiting for my"
1212,"speech—. I was confused—distressed—my thoughts were bewildered—and I"
1212,"could only add—“How do you do?” She saw and felt for my Embarrassment"
1212,"and with admirable presence of mind releived me from it by saying—“My"
1212,"dear Sophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself—I will turn the"
1212,"Conversation without appearing to notice it. “Oh! how I loved her for"
1212,"her kindness!” Do you ride as much as you used to do?” said she—. “I am"
1212,"advised to ride by my Physician. We have delightful Rides round us, I"
1212,"have a Charming horse, am uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied I"
1212,"quite recovered from my Confusion, and in short I ride a great deal.”"
1212,"“You are in the right my Love,” said she. Then repeating the following"
1212,"line which was an extempore and equally adapted to recommend both"
1212,"Riding and Candour—"

1212,"“Ride where you may, Be Candid where you can,” she added,” _I_ rode"
1212,"once, but it is many years ago—She spoke this in so low and tremulous a"
1212,"Voice, that I was silent—. Struck with her Manner of speaking I could"
1212,"make no reply. “I have not ridden, continued she fixing her Eyes on my"
1212,"face, since I was married.” I was never so surprised—“Married, Ma’am!”"
1212,"I repeated. “You may well wear that look of astonishment, said she,"
1212,"since what I have said must appear improbable to you—Yet nothing is"
1212,"more true than that I once was married.”"

1212,"“Then why are you called Miss Jane?”"

1212,"given in the death of my dear Capt. Dashwood—Pardon these tears,"

1212,"He fell my Sophia, while fighting for his Country in America after a"
1212,"most happy Union of seven years—. My Children, two sweet Boys and a"

1212,"him and with every one as the Children of a Brother (tho’ I had ever"
1212,"been an only Child) had as yet been the comforts of my Life. But no"
1212,"sooner had I lossed my Henry, than these sweet Creatures fell sick and"
1212,"died—. Conceive dear Sophia what my feelings must have been when as an"
1212,"Aunt I attended my Children to their early Grave—. My Father did not"
1212,"survive them many weeks—He died, poor Good old man, happily ignorant to"

1212,"hear without emotion) and as I was conscious of having no right to that"
1212,"of Annesley, I dropt all thoughts of either, and have made it a point"
1212,"of bearing only my Christian one since my Father’s death.” She"
1212,"paused—“Oh! my dear Miss Jane (said I) how infinitely am I obliged to"
1212,"you for so entertaining a story! You cannot think how it has diverted"
1212,"me! But have you quite done?”"
1212,""
1212,"“I have only to add my dear Sophia, that my Henry’s elder Brother"

1212,"LETTER the THIRD"
1212,"From a YOUNG LADY in distressed Circumstances to her freind"
1212,""
1212,""
1212,"A few days ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham. As my"
1212,"Mother never goes out she entrusted me to the care of Lady Greville who"
1212,"did me the honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to"
1212,"sit forwards, which is a favour about which I am very indifferent"
1212,"especially as I know it is considered as confering a great obligation"
1212,"on me “So Miss Maria (said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the"
1212,"door of the Carriage) you seem very smart to night—_My_ poor Girls will"
1212,"appear quite to disadvantage by _you_—I only hope your Mother may not"
1212,"have distressed herself to set _you_ off. Have you got a new Gown on?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Yes Ma’am.” replied I with as much indifference as I could assume."
1212,""
1212,"“Aye, and a fine one too I think—(feeling it, as by her permission I"
1212,"seated myself by her) I dare say it is all very smart—But I must own,"
1212,"for you know I always speak my mind, that I think it was quite a"
1212,"needless piece of expence—Why could not you have worn your old striped"
1212,"one? It is not my way to find fault with People because they are poor,"
1212,"for I always think that they are more to be despised and pitied than"
1212,"blamed for it, especially if they cannot help it, but at the same time"
1212,"I must say that in my opinion your old striped Gown would have been"
1212,"quite fine enough for its Wearer—for to tell you the truth (I always"
1212,"speak my mind) I am very much afraid that one half of the people in the"
1212,"room will not know whether you have a Gown on or not—But I suppose you"
1212,"intend to make your fortune to night—. Well, the sooner the better; and"
1212,"I wish you success.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Indeed Ma’am I have no such intention—”"
1212,""
1212,"“Who ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter?” Miss"
1212,"Greville laughed but I am sure Ellen felt for me."
1212,""
1212,"“Was your Mother gone to bed before you left her?” said her Ladyship."
1212,""
1212,"“Dear Ma’am, said Ellen it is but nine o’clock.”"
1212,""
1212,"“True Ellen, but Candles cost money, and Mrs Williams is too wise to be"
1212,"extravagant.”"
1212,""
1212,"“She was just sitting down to supper Ma’am.”"
1212,""
1212,"“And what had she got for supper?” “I did not observe.” “Bread and"
1212,"Cheese I suppose.” “I should never wish for a better supper.” said"
1212,"Ellen. “You have never any reason replied her Mother, as a better is"
1212,"always provided for you.” Miss Greville laughed excessively, as she"
1212,"constantly does at her Mother’s wit."
1212,""
1212,"Such is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while"
1212,"riding in her Ladyship’s Coach—I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother"
1212,"is always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my"
1212,"way in the world. She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady"
1212,"Greville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her"
1212,"House, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of"
1212,"being abused for my Poverty while I am in them.—When we arrived at"
1212,"Ashburnham, it was nearly ten o’clock, which was an hour and a half"
1212,"later than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too"
1212,"fashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The Dancing"
1212,"however was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been"
1212,"long in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just"
1212,"as we were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got"
1212,"his white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean"
1212,"time the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room"
1212,"went exactly before me—She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me"
1212,"though there were several people close to us,"
1212,""
1212,"“Hey day, Miss Maria! What cannot you get a partner? Poor Young Lady! I"
1212,"am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing. But do not despair;"
1212,"perhaps you may get a hop before the Evening is over.” So saying, she"
1212,"passed on without hearing my repeated assurance of being engaged, and"
1212,"leaving me very much provoked at being so exposed before every one—Mr"
1212,"Bernard however soon returned and by coming to me the moment he entered"
1212,"the room, and leading me to the Dancers my Character I hope was cleared"
1212,"from the imputation Lady Greville had thrown on it, in the eyes of all"
1212,"the old Ladies who had heard her speech. I soon forgot all my vexations"
1212,"in the pleasure of dancing and of having the most agreable partner in"
1212,"the room. As he is moreover heir to a very large Estate I could see"
1212,"that Lady Greville did not look very well pleased when she found who"
1212,"had been his Choice—She was determined to mortify me, and accordingly"
1212,"when we were sitting down between the dances, she came to me with"
1212,"_more_ than her usual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and"
1212,"said loud enough to be heard by half the people in the room, “Pray Miss"
1212,"Maria in what way of business was your Grandfather? for Miss Mason and"
1212,"I cannot agree whether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder.” I saw that she"
1212,"wanted to mortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent"
1212,"her seeing that her scheme succeeded. “Neither Madam; he was a Wine"
1212,"Merchant.” “Aye, I knew he was in some such low way—He broke did not"
1212,"he?” “I beleive not Ma’am.” “Did not he abscond?” “I never heard that"
1212,"he did.” “At least he died insolvent?” “I was never told so before.”"
1212,"“Why, was not your _Father_ as poor as a Rat” “I fancy not.” “Was not"
1212,"he in the Kings Bench once?” “I never saw him there.” She gave me"
1212,"_such_ a look, and turned away in a great passion; while I was half"
1212,"delighted with myself for my impertinence, and half afraid of being"
1212,"thought too saucy. As Lady Greville was extremely angry with me, she"
1212,"took no further notice of me all the Evening, and indeed had I been in"
1212,"favour I should have been equally neglected, as she was got into a"
1212,"Party of great folks and she never speaks to me when she can to anyone"
1212,"else. Miss Greville was with her Mother’s party at supper, but Ellen"
1212,"preferred staying with the Bernards and me. We had a very pleasant"
1212,"Dance and as Lady G—slept all the way home, I had a very comfortable"
1212,"ride."
1212,""
1212,"The next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville’s Coach stopped at"
1212,"the door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it"
1212,"should. She sent in a message by the servant to say that “she should"
1212,"not get out but that Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door, as she"
1212,"wanted to speak to her, and that she must make haste and come"
1212,"immediately—” “What an impertinent Message Mama!” said I—“Go Maria—”"
1212,"replied she—Accordingly I went and was obliged to stand there at her"
1212,"Ladyships pleasure though the Wind was extremely high and very cold."
1212,""
1212,"“Why I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last"
1212,"night—But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that"
1212,"you may dine with us the day after tomorrow—Not tomorrow, remember, do"
1212,"not come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas"
1212,"Stanley’s family—There will be no occasion for your being very fine for"
1212,"I shant send the Carriage—If it rains you may take an umbrella—” I"
1212,"could hardly help laughing at hearing her give me leave to keep myself"
1212,"dry—“And pray remember to be in time, for I shant wait—I hate my"
1212,"Victuals over-done—But you need not come before the time—How does your"
1212,"Mother do? She is at dinner is not she?” “Yes Ma’am we were in the"
1212,"middle of dinner when your Ladyship came.” “I am afraid you find it"
1212,"very cold Maria.” said Ellen. “Yes, it is an horrible East wind—said"
1212,"her Mother—I assure you I can hardly bear the window down—But you are"
1212,"used to be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made"
1212,"your Complexion so rudely and coarse. You young Ladies who cannot often"
1212,"ride in a Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in, or how the"
1212,"wind shews your legs. I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as"
1212,"you do in such a day as this. But some sort of people have no feelings"
1212,"either of cold or Delicacy—Well, remember that we shall expect you on"
1212,"Thursday at 5 o’clock—You must tell your Maid to come for you at"
1212,"night—There will be no Moon—and you will have an horrid walk home—My"
1212,"compts to Your Mother—I am afraid your dinner will be cold—Drive on—”"
1212,"And away she went, leaving me in a great passion with her as she always"
1212,"does."

1212,"LETTER the FOURTH"
1212,"From a YOUNG LADY rather impertinent to her freind"
1212,""
1212,""
1212,"We dined yesterday with Mr Evelyn where we were introduced to a very"
1212,"agreable looking Girl his Cousin. I was extremely pleased with her"
1212,"appearance, for added to the charms of an engaging face, her manner and"
1212,"voice had something peculiarly interesting in them. So much so, that"
1212,"they inspired me with a great curiosity to know the history of her"
1212,"Life, who were her Parents, where she came from, and what had befallen"
1212,"her, for it was then only known that she was a relation of Mr Evelyn,"
1212,"and that her name was Grenville. In the evening a favourable"
1212,"opportunity offered to me of attempting at least to know what I wished"
1212,"to know, for every one played at Cards but Mrs Evelyn, My Mother, Dr"
1212,"Drayton, Miss Grenville and myself, and as the two former were engaged"
1212,"in a whispering Conversation, and the Doctor fell asleep, we were of"
1212,"necessity obliged to entertain each other. This was what I wished and"
1212,"being determined not to remain in ignorance for want of asking, I began"
1212,"the Conversation in the following Manner."
1212,""
1212,"“Have you been long in Essex Ma’am?”"
1212,""
1212,"“I arrived on Tuesday.”"
1212,""
1212,"“You came from Derbyshire?”"
1212,""
1212,"“No, Ma’am! appearing surprised at my question, from Suffolk.” You will"
1212,"think this a good dash of mine my dear Mary, but you know that I am not"
1212,"wanting for Impudence when I have any end in veiw. “Are you pleased"
1212,"with the Country Miss Grenville? Do you find it equal to the one you"
1212,"have left?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Much superior Ma’am in point of Beauty.” She sighed. I longed to know"
1212,"for why."
1212,""
1212,"“But the face of any Country however beautiful said I, can be but a"
1212,"poor consolation for the loss of one’s dearest Freinds.” She shook her"
1212,"head, as if she felt the truth of what I said. My Curiosity was so much"
1212,"raised, that I was resolved at any rate to satisfy it."
1212,""
1212,"“You regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville?” “Indeed I do.”"
1212,"“You were born there I suppose?” “Yes Ma’am I was and passed many happy"
1212,"years there—”"
1212,""
1212,"“That is a great comfort—said I—I hope Ma’am that you never spent any"
1212,"_un_happy one’s there.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Perfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals, and no one has a"
1212,"right to expect uninterrupted Happiness.—_Some_ Misfortunes I have"
1212,"certainly met with.”"
1212,""
1212,"“_What_ Misfortunes dear Ma’am? replied I, burning with impatience to"
1212,"know every thing. “_None_ Ma’am I hope that have been the effect of any"
1212,"wilfull fault in me.” “I dare say not Ma’am, and have no doubt but that"
1212,"any sufferings you may have experienced could arise only from the"
1212,"cruelties of Relations or the Errors of Freinds.” She sighed—“You seem"
1212,"unhappy my dear Miss Grenville—Is it in my power to soften your"
1212,"Misfortunes?” “_Your_ power Ma’am replied she extremely surprised; it"
1212,"is in _no ones_ power to make me happy.” She pronounced these words in"
1212,"so mournfull and solemn an accent, that for some time I had not courage"
1212,"to reply. I was actually silenced. I recovered myself however in a few"
1212,"moments and looking at her with all the affection I could, “My dear"
1212,"Miss Grenville said I, you appear extremely young—and may probably"
1212,"stand in need of some one’s advice whose regard for you, joined to"
1212,"superior Age, perhaps superior Judgement might authorise her to give"
1212,"it. I am that person, and I now challenge you to accept the offer I"
1212,"make you of my Confidence and Freindship, in return to which I shall"
1212,"only ask for yours—”"
1212,""
1212,"“You are extremely obliging Ma’am—said she—and I am highly flattered by"
1212,"your attention to me—But I am in no difficulty, no doubt, no"
1212,"uncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted. Whenever I"
1212,"am however continued she brightening into a complaisant smile, I shall"
1212,"know where to apply.”"
1212,""
1212,"I bowed, but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse; still"
1212,"however I had not given up my point. I found that by the appearance of"
1212,"sentiment and Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined"
1212,"therefore to renew my attacks by Questions and suppositions. “Do you"
1212,"intend staying long in this part of England Miss Grenville?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Yes Ma’am, some time I beleive.”"
1212,""
1212,"“But how will Mr and Mrs Grenville bear your absence?”"
1212,""
1212,"“They are neither of them alive Ma’am.” This was an answer I did not"
1212,"expect—I was quite silenced, and never felt so awkward in my Life—."

1212,"from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady Scudamore to live"
1212,"within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely Creature first"
1212,"entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight of you was"
1212,"like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started—I gazed at her with"
1212,"admiration—She appeared every moment more Charming, and the unfortunate"
1212,"Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time to look"
1212,"about me. Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an happiness"
1212,"for which I cannot be too grateful. “What said he to himself is"
1212,"Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta? Enviable Mortal! and may he pine"
1212,"for her who is the object of universal admiration, who is adored by a"

1212,"Henrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love, or why"
1212,"refuse to confide in me?”"
1212,""
1212,"“I am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage. I do not refuse to"
1212,"confide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove,"
1212,"that I am sincerely attached to him, for it is no disgrace to love a"
1212,"handsome Man. If he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be"
1212,"ashamed of a passion which must have been mean since the object would"
1212,"have been unworthy. But with such a figure and face, and such beautiful"
1212,"hair as your Cousin has, why should I blush to own that such superior"
1212,"merit has made an impression on me.”"
1212,""
1212,"“My sweet Girl (said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection)"
1212,"what a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters, and what a"
1212,"quick discernment for one of your years! Oh! how I honour you for such"
1212,"Noble Sentiments!”"
1212,""
1212,"“Do you Ma’am said I; You are vastly obliging. But pray Lady Scudamore"
1212,"did your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like"
1212,"him the better if he did, for what is a Lover without a Confidante?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! my Love replied she, you were born for each other. Every word you"
1212,"say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the"
1212,"invisible power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so"
1212,"exactly coincide. Nay, the colour of your Hair is not very different."
1212,"Yes my dear Girl, the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the"
1212,"story of his Love—. Nor was I surprised at it—I know not how it was,"
1212,"but I had a kind of presentiment that he _would_ be in love with you.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Well, but how did he break it to you?”"
1212,""
1212,"“It was not till after supper. We were sitting round the fire together"
1212,"talking on indifferent subjects, though to say the truth the"
1212,"Conversation was cheifly on my side for he was thoughtful and silent,"
1212,"when on a sudden he interrupted me in the midst of something I was"
1212,"saying, by exclaiming in a most Theatrical tone—"
1212,""
1212,"Yes I’m in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! What a sweet way replied I, of declaring his Passion! To make such"
1212,"a couple of charming lines about me! What a pity it is that they are"
1212,"not in rhime!”"
1212,""
1212,"“I am very glad you like it answered she; To be sure there was a great"
1212,"deal of Taste in it. And are you in love with her, Cousin? said I. I am"
1212,"very sorry for it, for unexceptionable as you are in every respect,"
1212,"with a pretty Estate capable of Great improvements, and an excellent"
1212,"House tho’ somewhat out of repair, yet who can hope to aspire with"
1212,"success to the adorable Henrietta who has had an offer from a Colonel"
1212,"and been toasted by a Baronet”—“_That_ I have—” cried I. Lady Scudamore"
1212,"continued. “Ah dear Cousin replied he, I am so well convinced of the"
1212,"little Chance I can have of winning her who is adored by thousands,"
1212,"that I need no assurances of yours to make me more thoroughly so. Yet"
1212,"surely neither you or the fair Henrietta herself will deny me the"
1212,"exquisite Gratification of dieing for her, of falling a victim to her"
1212,"Charms. And when I am dead”—continued her—"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh Lady Scudamore, said I wiping my eyes, that such a sweet Creature"
1212,"should talk of dieing!”"
1212,""
1212,"“It is an affecting Circumstance indeed, replied Lady Scudamore.” “When"
1212,"I am dead said he, let me be carried and lain at her feet, and perhaps"
1212,"she may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Dear Lady Scudamore interrupted I, say no more on this affecting"
1212,"subject. I cannot bear it.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! how I admire the sweet sensibility of your Soul, and as I would"
1212,"not for Worlds wound it too deeply, I will be silent.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Pray go on.” said I. She did so."
1212,""
1212,"“And then added he, Ah! Cousin imagine what my transports will be when"
1212,"I feel the dear precious drops trickle on my face! Who would not die to"
1212,"haste such extacy! And when I am interred, may the divine Henrietta"
1212,"bless some happier Youth with her affection, May he be as tenderly"
1212,"attached to her as the hapless Musgrove and while _he_ crumbles to"
1212,"dust, May they live an example of Felicity in the Conjugal state!”"
1212,""
1212,"Did you ever hear any thing so pathetic? What a charming wish, to be"
1212,"lain at my feet when he was dead! Oh! what an exalted mind he must have"
1212,"to be capable of such a wish! Lady Scudamore went on."
1212,""
1212,"“Ah! my dear Cousin replied I to him, such noble behaviour as this,"
1212,"must melt the heart of any woman however obdurate it may naturally be;"
1212,"and could the divine Henrietta but hear your generous wishes for her"
1212,"happiness, all gentle as is her mind, I have not a doubt but that she"
1212,"would pity your affection and endeavour to return it.” “Oh! Cousin"
1212,"answered he, do not endeavour to raise my hopes by such flattering"
1212,"assurances. No, I cannot hope to please this angel of a Woman, and the"
1212,"only thing which remains for me to do, is to die.” “True Love is ever"
1212,"desponding replied I, but _I_ my dear Tom will give you even greater"
1212,"hopes of conquering this fair one’s heart, than I have yet given you,"
1212,"by assuring you that I watched her with the strictest attention during"
1212,"the whole day, and could plainly discover that she cherishes in her"
1212,"bosom though unknown to herself, a most tender affection for you.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Dear Lady Scudamore cried I, This is more than I ever knew!”"
1212,""
1212,"“Did not I say that it was unknown to yourself? I did not, continued I"
1212,"to him, encourage you by saying this at first, that surprise might"
1212,"render the pleasure still Greater.” “No Cousin replied he in a languid"
1212,"voice, nothing will convince me that _I_ can have touched the heart of"
1212,"Henrietta Halton, and if you are deceived yourself, do not attempt"
1212,"deceiving me.” “In short my Love it was the work of some hours for me"
1212,"to Persuade the poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference"
1212,"for him; but when at last he could no longer deny the force of my"
1212,"arguments, or discredit what I told him, his transports, his Raptures,"
1212,"his Extacies are beyond my power to describe.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! the dear Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me! But dear"
1212,"Lady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my"
1212,"Uncle and Aunt?”"
1212,""
1212,"“Yes, I told him every thing.”"
1212,""
1212,"“And what did he say.”"
1212,""
1212,"“He exclaimed with virulence against Uncles and Aunts; Accused the laws"
1212,"of England for allowing them to Possess their Estates when wanted by"
1212,"their Nephews or Neices, and wished _he_ were in the House of Commons,"
1212,"that he might reform the Legislature, and rectify all its abuses.”"
1212,""
1212,"“Oh! the sweet Man! What a spirit he has!” said I."
1212,""
1212,"“He could not flatter himself he added, that the adorable Henrietta"
1212,"would condescend for his sake to resign those Luxuries and that"
1212,"splendor to which she had been used, and accept only in exchange the"
1212,"Comforts and Elegancies which his limited Income could afford her, even"
1212,"supposing that his house were in Readiness to receive her. I told him"
1212,"that it could not be expected that she would; it would be doing her an"
1212,"injustice to suppose her capable of giving up the power she now"

1212,""
1212,"MY DEAR LOUISA"
1212,""
1212,"Your friend Mr Millar called upon us yesterday in his way to Bath,"
1212,"whither he is going for his health; two of his daughters were with him,"
1212,"but the eldest and the three Boys are with their Mother in Sussex."
1212,"Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably handsome,"
1212,"you never mentioned anything of her Sisters’ beauty; yet they are"
1212,"certainly extremely pretty. I’ll give you their description.—Julia is"
1212,"eighteen; with a countenance in which Modesty, Sense and Dignity are"
1212,"happily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace,"
1212,"Elegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than"
1212,"her Sister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of"
1212,"Julia’s, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as"
1212,"estimable. She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness"
1212,"the most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking. She"
1212,"appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her"
1212,"conversation during the half hour they set with us, was replete with"
1212,"humourous sallies, Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible, the"
1212,"amiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her"
1212,"own. Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received"
1212,"of him. My Father met him with that look of Love, that social Shake,"
1212,"and cordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and"
1212,"valued freind from whom thro’ various circumstances he had been"
1212,"separated nearly twenty years. Mr Millar observed (and very justly too)"
1212,"that many events had befallen each during that interval of time, which"
1212,"gave occasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections"
1212,"on the many changes in their situation which so long a period had"
1212,"occasioned, on the advantages of some, and the disadvantages of others."
1212,"From this subject she made a short digression to the instability of"
1212,"human pleasures and the uncertainty of their duration, which led her to"
1212,"observe that all earthly Joys must be imperfect. She was proceeding to"
1212,"illustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when"
1212,"the Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father"
1212,"and Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending"
1212,"five or six months with us on their return. We of course mentioned you,"
1212,"and I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all."
1212,"“Louisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet"
1212,"sometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite."
1212,"She neither wants Understanding or is without some pretensions to"
1212,"Beauty, but these are so very trifling, that the value she sets on her"
1212,"personal charms, and the adoration she expects them to be offered are"
1212,"at once a striking example of her vanity, her pride, and her folly.” So"
1212,"said I, and to my opinion everyone added weight by the concurrence of"
1212,"their own."

1212,"Many have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life, my beloved"
1212,"Ellinor, and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that"
1212,"on a close examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have"
1212,"strictly deserved them. I murdered my father at a very early period of"
1212,"my Life, I have since murdered my Mother, and I am now going to murder"
1212,"my Sister. I have changed my religion so often that at present I have"
1212,"not an idea of any left. I have been a perjured witness in every public"
1212,"tryal for these last twelve years; and I have forged my own Will. In"
1212,"short there is scarcely a crime that I have not committed—But I am now"
1212,"going to reform. Colonel Martin of the Horse guards has paid his"
1212,"Addresses to me, and we are to be married in a few days. As there is"
1212,"something singular in our Courtship, I will give you an account of it."
1212,"Colonel Martin is the second son of the late Sir John Martin who died"
1212,"immensely rich, but bequeathing only one hundred thousand pound apeice"
1212,"to his three younger Children, left the bulk of his fortune, about"
1212,"eight Million to the present Sir Thomas. Upon his small pittance the"
1212,"Colonel lived tolerably contented for nearly four months when he took"
1212,"it into his head to determine on getting the whole of his eldest"
1212,"Brother’s Estate. A new will was forged and the Colonel produced it in"
1212,"Court—but nobody would swear to it’s being the right will except"
1212,"himself, and he had sworn so much that Nobody beleived him. At that"
1212,"moment I happened to be passing by the door of the Court, and was"
1212,"beckoned in by the Judge who told the Colonel that I was a Lady ready"
1212,"to witness anything for the cause of Justice, and advised him to apply"
1212,"to me. In short the Affair was soon adjusted. The Colonel and I swore"
1212,"to its’ being the right will, and Sir Thomas has been obliged to resign"
1212,"all his illgotten wealth. The Colonel in gratitude waited on me the"
1212,"next day with an offer of his hand—. I am now going to murder my"

1212,"Closet."

1212,"The delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother, and"
1212,"shewed him the advertisement. Robertus congratulated him and sent him"
1212,"in his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling for"
1212,"three days and six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest"
1212,"and following a track which led by it’s side down a steep Hill over"
1212,"which ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour."
1212,"Wilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without"
1212,"receiving any answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door"
1212,"which was fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room,"
1212,"which he immediately perceived to be one of the two that were"
1212,"unfurnished—From thence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A pair"
1212,"of stairs that went out of it led him into a room above, no less"
1212,"destitute, and these apartments he found composed the whole of the"
1212,"House. He was by no means displeased with this discovery, as he had the"
1212,"comfort of reflecting that he should not be obliged to lay out anything"
1212,"on furniture himself—. He returned immediately to his Brother, who took"
1212,"him the next day to every Shop in Town, and bought what ever was"
1212,"requisite to furnish the two rooms and the Closet, In a few days"
1212,"everything was completed, and Wilhelminus returned to take possession"
1212,"of his Cottage. Robertus accompanied him, with his Lady the amiable"
1212,"Cecilia and her two lovely Sisters Arabella and Marina to whom"
1212,"Wilhelminus was tenderly attached, and a large number of Attendants.—An"
1212,"ordinary Genius might probably have been embarrassed, in endeavouring"
1212,"to accomodate so large a party, but Wilhelminus with admirable presence"
1212,"of mind gave orders for the immediate erection of two noble Tents in an"
1212,"open spot in the Forest adjoining to the house. Their Construction was"
1212,"both simple and elegant—A couple of old blankets, each supported by"
1212,"four sticks, gave a striking proof of that taste for architecture and"
1212,"that happy ease in overcoming difficulties which were some of"
1212,"Wilhelminus’s most striking Virtues."
