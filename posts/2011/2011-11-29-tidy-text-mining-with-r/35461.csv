35461,"A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of"
35461,"the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and the"
35461,"pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or"
35461,"adaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills or by the sea."
35461,"Among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of"
35461,"scale—scales that were elongated into quill-like forms and that"
35461,"presently branched into the crude beginnings of feathers. These"
35461,"quill-like scales layover one another and formed a heat-retaining"
35461,"covering more efficient than any reptilian covering that had hitherto"
35461,"existed.  So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were"
35461,"otherwise uninhabited.  Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there"
35461,"arose in these creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs.  Most"
35461,"reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left"
35461,"for sun and season to hatch.  But some of the varieties upon this new"
35461,"branch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their"
35461,"eggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies."

35461,"With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going"
35461,"on that made these creatures, the primitive birds, warm-blooded and"
35461,"independent of basking.  The very earliest birds seem to have been"
35461,"seabirds living upon fish, and their fore limbs were not wings but"
35461,"paddles rather after the penguin type.  That peculiarly primitive bird,"
35461,"the New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither"
35461,"flies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors.  In the"
35461,"development of the birds, feathers came before wings.  But once the"
35461,"feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of"
35461,"feathers led inevitably to the wing.  We know of the fossil remains of"
35461,"one bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long"
35461,"reptilian tail, but which also had a true bird’s wing and which"
35461,"certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic"
35461,"time.  Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic"
35461,"times.  If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he might"
35461,"walk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though he"

35461,"lesser degree bird life, from the life of the reptile.  With very few"

35461,"with the suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the"
35461,"new mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning by"

35461,"capacity.  For instance we find at a comparatively early stage that"

35461,"before this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive"

35461,"father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult life,"

35461,"that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters"
35461,"of the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were"
35461,"working out two vitally important things; they were beginning"
35461,"cultivation and they were domesticating animals. They were also"
35461,"beginning to make, in addition to the chipped implements of their"
35461,"hunter forebears, implements of polished stone. They had discovered the"
35461,"possibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre,"

35461,"7000 B.C. there were already quasi-civilized communities almost at the"
35461,"Peruvian level, appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the"
35461,"Nile valley. At that time north Persia and western Turkestan and south"
35461,"Arabia were all more fertile than they are now, and there are traces of"
35461,"very early communities in these regions. It is in lower Mesopotamia"
35461,"however and in Egypt that there first appear cities, temples,"
35461,"systematic irrigation, and evidences of a social organization rising"
35461,"above the level of a mere barbaric village-town. In those days the"
35461,"Euphrates and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf,"
35461,"and it was in the country between them that the Sumerians built their"
35461,"first cities. About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the"
35461,"great history of Egypt was beginning."
35461,""
35461,"These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent"
35461,"noses.  They employed a sort of writing that has been deciphered, and"
35461,"their language is now known.  They had discovered the use of bronze and"
35461,"they built great tower-like temples of sun-dried brick. The clay of"
35461,"this country is very fine; they used it to write upon, and so it is"
35461,"that their inscriptions have been preserved to us.  They had cattle,"
35461,"sheep, goats and asses, but no horses.  They fought on foot, in close"
35461,"formation, carrying spears and shields of skin. Their clothing was of"
35461,"wool and they shaved their heads."
35461,""
35461,"Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent"
35461,"state with a god of its own and priests of its own.  But sometimes one"
35461,"city would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from"
35461,"their population.  A very ancient inscription at Nippur records the"
35461,"“empire,” the first recorded empire, of the Sumerian city of Erech. "

35461,"centuries between 6000 and 8000 B.C. Wherever there were possibilities"
35461,"of irrigation and a steady all-the-year-round food supply men were"
35461,"exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and wandering for"
35461,"the routines of settlement. On the upper Tigris a people called the"
35461,"Assyrians were founding cities; in the valleys of Asia Minor and on the"

35461,"up to civilization. Possibly parallel developments of human life were"
35461,"already going on in favourable regions of India, and China. In many"
35461,"parts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little"
35461,"communities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over"
35461,"the water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting. But"

35461,"It is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the"

35461,"gentleman of 2500 B.C. iron was a rare metal which fell out of the sky"
35461,"and was curious rather than useful—for as yet only meteoric iron was"
35461,"known, iron had not been obtained from its ores.  Compare that with our"
35461,"modern state of affairs pervaded by iron everywhere.  The horse again"
35461,"would be a quite legendary creature to our Cretan, a sort of super-ass"
35461,"which lived in the bleak northern lands far away beyond the Black Sea."
35461,"Civilization for him dwelt chiefly in Ægean Greece and Asia Minor,"
35461,"where Lydians and Carians and Trojans lived a life and probably spoke"
35461,"languages like his own.  There were Phœnicians and Ægeans settled in"
35461,"Spain and North Africa, but those were very remote regions to his"
35461,"imagination.  Italy was still a desolate land covered with dense"
35461,"forests; the brown-skinned Etruscans had not yet gone there from Asia"
35461,"Minor.  And one day perhaps this Cretan gentleman went down to the"
35461,"harbour and saw a captive who attracted his attention because he was"
35461,"very fair-complexioned and had blue eyes.  Perhaps our Cretan tried to"
35461,"talk to him and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish.  This"
35461,"creature came from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an"
35461,"altogether benighted savage.  But indeed he was an Aryan tribesman, of"
35461,"a race and culture of which we shall soon have much to tell, and the"

35461,"entertainment did much to make it a fine and beautiful instrument of"
35461,"expression, and to that no doubt the subsequent predominance of the"
35461,"languages derived from Aryan is, in part, to be ascribed.  Every Aryan"

35461,"The social life of these people centred about the households of their"

35461,"this hall was the general centre, everyone went there to feast and hear"
35461,"the bards and take part in games and discussions.  Cowsheds and"
35461,"stabling surrounded it.  The chief and his wife and so forth would"

35461,"anywhere, as people still do in Indian households.  Except for weapons,"
35461,"ornaments, tools and suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of"

35461,"library not of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for writing"

35461,"accession of Sargon I he commemorated the fact by inscriptions.  But"
35461,"there were many signs of disunion in his empire, and he sought to"
35461,"centralize it by bringing a number of the various local gods to Babylon"
35461,"and setting up temples to them there.  This device was to be practised"
35461,"quite successfully by the Romans in later times, but in Babylon it"
35461,"roused the jealousy of the powerful priesthood of Bel Marduk, the"
35461,"dominant god of the Babylonians.  They cast about for a possible"
35461,"alternative to Nabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler"
35461,"of the adjacent Median Empire.  Cyrus had already distinguished himself"

35461,"which became at last what Christians know as the Old Testament, the"
35461,"Hebrew Bible.  This literature appears in history in the fourth or"
35461,"fifth century B.C."
35461,""
35461,"Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon. We have"
35461,"already told how the Pharaoh, Necho II, invaded the Assyrian Empire"
35461,"while Assyria was fighting for life against Medes, Persians and"
35461,"Chaldeans.  Josiah King of Judah opposed him, and was defeated and"
35461,"slain at Megiddo (608 B.C.).  Judah became a tributary to Egypt, and"
35461,"when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in Babylon, rolled"
35461,"back Necho into Egypt, he attempted to manage Judah by setting up"
35461,"puppet kings in Jerusalem.  The experiment failed, the people massacred"
35461,"his Babylonian officials, and he then determined to break up this"
35461,"little state altogether, which had long been playing off Egypt against"
35461,"the northern empire.  Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant"
35461,"of the people was carried off captive to Babylon."
35461,""
35461,"There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon (538 B.C.).  He then"
35461,"collected them together and sent them back to resettle their country"
35461,"and rebuild the walls and temple of Jerusalem."
35461,""
35461,"Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very civilized or"

35461,"The fall of Assyria and Babylon were only the first of a series of"
35461,"disasters that were to happen to the Semitic peoples. In the seventh"
35461,"century B.C. it would have seemed as though the whole civilized world"
35461,"was to be dominated by Semitic rulers. They ruled the great Assyrian"
35461,"empire and they had conquered Egypt; Assyria, Babylon, Syria were all"
35461,"Semitic, speaking languages that were mutually intelligible. The trade"
35461,"of the world was in Semitic hands. Tyre, Sidon, the great mother cities"
35461,"of the Phœnician coast, had thrown out colonies that grew at last to"
35461,"even greater proportion in Spain, Sicily and Africa. Carthage, founded"
35461,"before 800 B.C., had risen to a population of more than a million. It"
35461,"was for a time the greatest city on earth. Its ships went to Britain"
35461,"and out into the Atlantic. They may have reached Madeira. We have"
35461,"already noted how Hiram co-operated with Solomon to build ships on the"
35461,"Red Sea for the Arabian and perhaps for the Indian trade. In the time"
35461,"of the Pharaoh Necho, a Phœnician expedition sailed completely round"
35461,"Africa."
35461,""
35461,"At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians.  Only the Greeks"
35461,"were reconstructing a new civilization of the ruins of the one they had"
35461,"destroyed, and the Medes were becoming “formidable,” as an Assyrian"
35461,"inscription calls them, in central Asia.  In 800 B.C. no one could have"
35461,"prophesied that before the third century B.C. every trace of Semitic"
35461,"dominion would be wiped out by Aryan-speaking conquerors, and that"
35461,"everywhere the Semitic peoples would be subjects or tributaries or"
35461,"scattered altogether.  Everywhere except in the northern deserts of"
35461,"Arabia, where the Bedouin adhered steadily to the nomadic way of life,"
35461,"the ancient way of life of the Semites before Sargon I and his"
35461,"Akkadians went down to conquer Sumeria.  But the Arab Bedouin were"
35461,"never conquered by Aryan masters."
35461,""
35461,"Now of all these civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in these"
35461,"five eventful centuries one people only held together and clung to its"
35461,"ancient traditions and that was this little people, the Jews, who were"
35461,"sent back to build their city of Jerusalem by Cyrus the Persian.  And"
35461,"they were able to do this, because they had got together this"
35461,"literature of theirs, their Bible, in Babylon.  It is not so much the"
35461,"Jews who made the Bible as the Bible which made the Jews.  Running"
35461,"through this Bible were certain ideas, different from the ideas of the"
35461,"people about them, very stimulating and sustaining ideas, to which they"
35461,"were destined to cling through five and twenty centuries of hardship,"
35461,"adventure and oppression."
35461,""
35461,"Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was invisible"
35461,"and remote, an invisible God in a temple not made with hands, a Lord of"
35461,"Righteousness throughout the earth. All other peoples had national gods"
35461,"embodied in images that lived in temples.  If the image was smashed and"
35461,"the temple razed, presently that god died out.  But this was a new"
35461,"idea, this God of the Jews, in the heavens, high above priests and"
35461,"sacrifices.  And this God of Abraham, the Jews believed, had chosen"
35461,"them to be his peculiar people, to restore Jerusalem and make it the"
35461,"capital of Righteousness in the World.  They were a people exalted by"
35461,"their sense of a common destiny. This belief saturated them all when"
35461,"they returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon."
35461,""
35461,"Is it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and subjugation many"
35461,"Babylonians and Syrians and so forth and later on many Phœnicians,"
35461,"speaking practically the same language and having endless customs,"
35461,"habits, tastes and traditions in common, should be attracted by this"
35461,"inspiring cult and should seek to share in its fellowship and its"
35461,"promise?  After the fall of Tyre, Sidon, Carthage and the Spanish"
35461,"Phœnician cities, the Phœnicians suddenly vanish from history; and as"
35461,"suddenly we find, not simply in Jerusalem but in Spain, Africa, Egypt,"
35461,"Arabia, the East, wherever the Phœnicians had set their feet,"
35461,"communities of Jews.  And they were all held together by the Bible and"
35461,"by the reading of the Bible.  Jerusalem was from the first only their"
35461,"nominal capital; their real city was this book of books.  This is a new"
35461,"sort of thing in history.  It is something of which the seeds were sown"
35461,"long before, when the Sumerians and Egyptians began to turn their"
35461,"hieroglyphics into writing.  The Jews were a new thing, a people"
35461,"without a king and presently without a temple (for as we shall tell"
35461,"Jerusalem itself was broken up in 70 A.D.), held together and"
35461,"consolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of"
35461,"the written word."
35461,""
35461,"And this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor foreseen"
35461,"nor done by either priests or statesmen.  Not only a new kind of"
35461,"community but a new kind of man comes into history with the development"
35461,"of the Jews.  In the days of Solomon the Hebrews looked like becoming a"
35461,"little people just like any other little people of that time clustering"
35461,"around court and temple, ruled by the wisdom of the priest and led by"
35461,"the ambition of the king.  But already, the reader may learn from the"

35461,"denounced the indolence of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of"
35461,"the King.  Some of them turned their attention to what we should now"

35461,"Righteousness. That is their supreme importance in the history of"

35461,"Like most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters whose"
35461,"performances were an important social link, and these handed down from"
35461,"the barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics, the _Iliad_,"
35461,"telling how a league of Greek tribes besieged and took and sacked the"
35461,"town of Troy in Asia Minor, and the _Odyssey_, being a long adventure"
35461,"story of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his own"
35461,"island.  These epics were written down somewhen in the eighth or"
35461,"seventh century B.C., when the Greeks had acquired the use of an"
35461,"alphabet from their more civilized neighbours, but they are supposed to"
35461,"have been in existence very much earlier.  Formerly they were ascribed"
35461,"to a particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down"
35461,"and composed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost. Whether there"
35461,"really was such a poet, whether he composed or only wrote down and"
35461,"polished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling ground"
35461,"for the erudite.  We need not concern ourselves with such bickerings"
35461,"here.  The thing that matters from our point of view is that the Greeks"
35461,"were in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and that"
35461,"they were a common possession and a link between their various tribes,"
35461,"giving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians. "
35461,"They were a group of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and"
35461,"afterwards by the written word, and sharing common ideals of courage"
35461,"and behaviour."
35461,""
35461,"The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without"
35461,"writing, and still not living in cities.  They seem to have lived at"
35461,"first in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside"
35461,"the ruins of the Ægean cities they had destroyed.  Then they began to"
35461,"wall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people they"
35461,"had conquered.  It has been said that the cities of the primitive"
35461,"civilizations grew up about the altar of some tribal god, and that the"
35461,"wall was added; in the cities of the Greeks the wall preceded the"
35461,"temple.  They began to trade and send out colonies.  By the seventh"
35461,"century B.C. a new series of cities had grown up in the valleys and"
35461,"islands of Greece, forgetful of the Ægean cities and civilization that"
35461,"had preceded them; Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus"
35461,"among the chief. There were already Greek settlements along the coast"
35461,"of the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily.  The heel and toe of Italy"
35461,"was called Magna Græcia.  Marseilles was a Greek town established on"

35461,"Now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief means of"

35461,"the Greek peoples were cut up among islands and mountain valleys; both"
35461,"Greece and Magna Græcia are very mountainous; and the tendency was all"
35461,"the other way.  When the Greeks come into history they are divided up"

35461,"They are different even in race.  Some consist chiefly of citizens of"
35461,"this or that Greek tribe, Ionic, Æolian or Doric; some have a mingled"

35461,"folk; some have an unmixed free citizenship of Greeks lording it over"
35461,"an enslaved conquered population like the “Helots” in Sparta.  In some"

35461,"Pharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of Mesopotamia.  Both thought and"
35461,"government therefore had a freedom under Greek conditions such as they"

35461,"successor, Xerxes, prepared a host to crush the Greeks.  For a time"
35461,"terror united all the Greeks.  The army of Xerxes was certainly the"
35461,"greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world.  It was a huge"
35461,"assembly of discordant elements.  It crossed the Dardanelles, 480 B.C.,"

35461,""
35461,""
35461,"The century and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was one of"
35461,"very great splendour for the Greek civilization. True that Greece was"
35461,"torn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy between Athens, Sparta and"
35461,"other states (the Peloponnesian War 431 to 404 B.C.) and that in 338"
35461,"B.C. the Macedonians became virtually masters of Greece; nevertheless"
35461,"during this period the thought and the creative and artistic impulse of"
35461,"the Greeks rose to levels that made their achievement a lamp to mankind"
35461,"for all the rest of history."
35461,""
35461,"The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens.  For over"
35461,"thirty years (466 to 428 B.C.) Athens was dominated by a man of great"
35461,"vigour and liberality of mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the"
35461,"city from the ashes to which the Persians had reduced it. The beautiful"
35461,"ruins that still glorify Athens to-day are chiefly the remains of this"
35461,"great effort.  And he did not simply rebuild a material Athens.  He"
35461,"rebuilt Athens intellectually.  He gathered about him not only"
35461,"architects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers and"
35461,"teachers.  Herodotus came to Athens to recite his history (438 B.C.)."
35461,"Anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description of the"
35461,"sun and stars.  Æschylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other"
35461,"carried the Greek drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility."
35461,""
35461,"The impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens lived on"
35461,"after his death, and in spite of the fact that the peace of Greece was"
35461,"now broken by the Peloponnesian War and a long and wasteful struggle"
35461,"for “ascendancy” was beginning.  Indeed the darkling of the political"
35461,"horizon seems for a time to have quickened rather than discouraged"
35461,"men’s minds."
35461,""
35461,"Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of Greek"
35461,"institutions had given great importance to skill in discussion. "
35461,"Decision rested neither with king nor with priest but in the assemblies"
35461,"of the people or of leading men.  Eloquence and able argument became"
35461,"very desirable accomplishments therefore, and a class of teachers"
35461,"arose, the Sophists, who undertook to strengthen young men in these"
35461,"arts.  But one cannot reason without matter, and knowledge followed in"
35461,"the wake of speech.  The activities and rivalries of these Sophists led"
35461,"very naturally to an acute examination of style, of methods of thought"
35461,"and of the validity of arguments.  When Pericles died a certain"
35461,"Socrates was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of"
35461,"bad argument—and much of the teaching of the Sophists was bad argument."
35461," A group of brilliant young men gathered about Socrates.  In the end"
35461,"Socrates was executed for disturbing people’s minds (399 B.C.), he was"
35461,"condemned after the dignified fashion of the Athens of those days to"
35461,"drink in his own house and among his own friends a poisonous draught"
35461,"made from hemlock, but the disturbance of people’s minds went on in"
35461,"spite of his condemnation. His young men carried on his teaching."

35461,"For a time Aristotle was tutor to Alexander, the king’s son, who was"
35461,"destined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon be"

35461," He made no Utopias.  Before man could really control his destiny as"

35461,"that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we call Science."

35461,"to power and civilization. The Macedonians spoke a language closely"
35461,"akin to Greek, and on several occasions Macedonian competitors had"
35461,"taken part in the Olympic games. In 359 B.C. a man of very great"
35461,"abilities and ambition became king of this little country—Philip."
35461,"Philip had previously been a hostage in Greece; he had had a thoroughly"
35461,"Greek education and he was probably aware of the ideas of"
35461,"Herodotus—which had also been developed by the philosopher Isocrates—of"
35461,"a possible conquest of Asia by a consolidated Greece."
35461,""
35461,"He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to"
35461,"remodel his army.  For a thousand years now the charging horse-chariot"
35461,"had been the decisive factor in battles, that and the close-fighting"
35461,"infantry.  Mounted horsemen had also fought, but as a cloud of"
35461,"skirmishers, individually and without discipline.  Philip made his"
35461,"infantry fight in a closely packed mass, the Macedonian phalanx, and he"
35461,"trained his mounted gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight in"
35461,"formation and so invented cavalry.  The master move in most of his"
35461,"battles and in the battles of his son Alexander was a cavalry charge. "
35461,"The phalanx _held_ the enemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept"

35461,"THE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIA"
35461,""
35461,""
35461,"Before the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as"
35461,"merchants, artists, officials, mercenary soldiers, over most of the"
35461,"Persian dominions. In the dynastic disputes that followed the death of"
35461,"Xerxes, a band of ten thousand Greek mercenaries played a part under"
35461,"the leadership of Xenophon. Their return to Asiatic Greece from Babylon"
35461,"is described in his _Retreat of the Ten Thousand_, one of the first war"
35461,"stories that was ever written by a general in command. But the"
35461,"conquests of Alexander and the division of his brief empire among his"
35461,"subordinate generals, greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient"
35461,"world by the Greeks and their language and fashions and culture. Traces"
35461,"of this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia"
35461,"and in north-west India. Their influence upon the development of Indian"
35461,"art was profound."
35461,""
35461,"For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and"
35461,"culture; her schools went on indeed to 529 A.D., that is to say for"
35461,"nearly a thousand years; but the leadership in the intellectual"
35461,"activity of the world passed presently across the Mediterranean to"
35461,"Alexandria, the new trading city that Alexander had founded. Here the"
35461,"Macedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with a court that spoke"
35461,"Greek.  He had become an intimate of Alexander before he became king,"
35461,"and he was deeply saturated with the ideas of Aristotle.  He set"
35461,"himself, with great energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and"
35461,"investigation. He also wrote a history of Alexander’s campaigns which,"
35461,"unhappily, is lost to the world."
35461,""
35461,"Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the"
35461,"enquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first person to make a"
35461,"permanent endowment of science.  He set up a foundation in Alexandria"
35461,"which was formerly dedicated to the Muses, the Museum of Alexandria. "
35461,"For two or three generations the scientific work done at Alexandria was"
35461,"extraordinarily good.  Euclid, Eratosthenes who measured the size of"
35461,"the earth and came within fifty miles of its true diameter, Apollonius"
35461,"who wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus who made the first star map and"
35461,"catalogue, and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the"
35461,"greater stars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers."
35461,"Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a"
35461,"frequent correspondent of the Museum.  Herophilus was one of the"
35461,"greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have practised"
35461,"vivisection."
35461,""
35461,"For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II"
35461,"there was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery at Alexandria as the"
35461,"world was not to see again until the sixteenth century A.D.  But it did"
35461,"not continue.  There may have been several causes of this decline. "
35461,"Chief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy suggested, was the fact"
35461,"that the Museum was a “royal” college and all its professors and"
35461,"fellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh.  This was all very well"
35461,"when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle.  But as"
35461,"the dynasty of the Ptolemies went on they became Egyptianized, they"
35461,"fell under the sway of Egyptian priests and Egyptian religious"
35461,"developments, they ceased to follow the work that was done, and their"
35461,"control stifled the spirit of enquiry altogether.  The Museum produced"
35461,"little good work after its first century of activity."
35461,""
35461,"Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the"
35461,"finding of fresh knowledge.  He tried also to set up an encyclopædic"
35461,"storehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria.  It was not simply a"
35461,"storehouse, it was also a book-copying and book-selling organization. "
35461,"A great army of copyists was set to work perpetually multiplying copies"
35461,"of books."
35461,""
35461,"Here then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual"
35461,"process in which we live to-day; here we have the systematic gathering"
35461,"and distribution of knowledge.  The foundation of this Museum and"
35461,"Library marks one of the great epochs in the history of mankind.  It is"

35461,"Both the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under"
35461,"serious handicaps.  One of these was the great social gap that"
35461,"separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the"
35461,"artisan.  There were glass workers and metal workers in abundance in"
35461,"those days, but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers.  The"
35461,"glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials"
35461,"and so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask or a lens.  Clear"
35461,"glass does not seem to have interested him. The metal worker made"
35461,"weapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance.  The"
35461,"philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things,"
35461,"but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters"
35461,"and so forth. He was not interested in substances.  So Alexandria in"
35461,"its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry. "
35461,"And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump"
35461,"or drive a boat or do any useful thing.  There were few practical"
35461,"applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the"
35461,"progress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest"
35461,"and excitement of practical applications.  There was nothing to keep"
35461,"the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I"
35461,"and Ptolemy II was withdrawn.  The discoveries of the Museum went on"
35461,"record in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of"
35461,"scientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of"
35461,"mankind."
35461,""
35461,"Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making. That"
35461,"ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp.  Paper"
35461,"was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until"
35461,"the ninth century A.D.  The only book materials were parchment and"
35461,"strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.  These strips were kept"
35461,"on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very"
35461,"inconvenient for reference.  It was these things that prevented the"
35461,"development of paged and printed books.  Printing itself was known in"
35461,"the world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals"
35461,"in ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little"
35461,"advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been"
35461,"resisted by trades unionism on the part of the copyists employed. "
35461,"Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never"
35461,"spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the"
35461,"level of a wealthy and influential class."

35461,"brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the"
35461,"brief empire of Alexander.  There was, for example, the Greek city of"
35461,"Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and science flourished for two"
35461,"centuries; there was Pergamum in Asia Minor, which also had a great"
35461,"library.  But this brilliant Hellenic world was now stricken by"
35461,"invasion from the north. New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were"
35461,"striking down along the tracks that had once been followed by the"
35461,"ancestors of the Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians.  They raided,"
35461,"shattered and destroyed.  And in the wake of the Gauls came a new"
35461,"conquering people out of Italy, the Romans, who gradually subjugated"
35461,"all the western half of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.  They"
35461,"were an able but unimaginative people, preferring law and profit to"
35461,"either science or art.  New invaders were also coming down out of"
35461,"central Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off"

35461,"But now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great"
35461,"teacher who came near to revolutionizing the religious thought and"
35461,"feeling of all Asia. This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples"
35461,"at Benares in India about the same time that Isaiah was prophesying"
35461,"among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on his"
35461,"speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus. All these"
35461,"men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century"
35461,"B.C.—unaware of one another."
35461,""
35461,"This sixth century B.C. was indeed one of the most remarkable in all"
35461,"history. Everywhere—for as we shall tell it was also the case in"
35461,"China—men’s minds were displaying a new boldness. Everywhere they were"
35461,"waking up out of the traditions of kingships and priests and blood"
35461,"sacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions.  It is as if the"
35461,"race had reached a stage of adolescence—after a childhood of twenty"
35461,"thousand years."
35461,""
35461,"The early history of India is still very obscure.  Somewhen perhaps"
35461,"about 2000 B.C., an Aryan- speaking people came down from the"
35461,"north-west into India either in one invasion or in a series of"
35461,"invasions; and was able to spread its language and traditions over most"
35461,"of north India.  Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit."
35461," They found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and"
35461,"less vigour of will, in possession of the country of the Indus and"
35461,"Ganges.  But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors"
35461,"as freely as did the Greeks and Persians.  They remained aloof.  When"
35461,"the past of India becomes dimly visible to the historian, Indian"
35461,"society is already stratified into several layers, with a variable"
35461,"number of sub-divisions, which do not eat together nor intermarry nor"
35461,"associate freely.  And throughout history this stratification into"
35461,"castes continues.  This makes the Indian population something different"

35461,"communities.  It is really a community of communities."
35461,""
35461,"Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a"
35461,"small district on the Himalayan slopes.  He was married at nineteen to"
35461,"a beautiful cousin.  He hunted and played and went about in his sunny"
35461,"world of gardens and groves and irrigated rice-fields.  And it was"

35461,"The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the"

35461,"ascetics who already existed in great numbers in India.  These men"
35461,"lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and in"
35461,"religious discussion.  They were supposed to be seeking some deeper"

35461,"and self-forgetful _externalized_ curiosity with which Thales and"
35461,"Heraclitus were attacking the problems of the universe, or the equally"
35461,"self-forgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating"
35461,"prophets were imposing upon the Hebrew mind.  The Indian teacher did"
35461,"not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it. "
35461,"All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the"
35461,"individual.  Until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is"
35461,"trouble and his end sorrow.  There were three principal forms that the"
35461,"craving for life took and they were all evil.  The first was the desire"
35461,"of the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second was"
35461,"the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the"
35461,"craving for personal success, worldliness, avarice and the like.  All"
35461,"these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses"
35461,"and chagrins of life.  When they were overcome, when self had vanished"
35461,"altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highest good was"
35461,"attained."
35461,""
35461,"This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical"
35461,"teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand as the Greek"
35461,"injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew"
35461,"command to fear God and accomplish righteousness.  It was a teaching"
35461,"much beyond the understanding of even Gautama’s immediate disciples,"
35461,"and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was"
35461,"withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened.  There was a widespread"
35461,"belief in India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to"
35461,"earth and was incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the"
35461,"Buddha.  Gautama’s disciples declared that he was a Buddha, the latest"
35461,"of the Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever"
35461,"accepted the title.  Before he was well dead, a cycle of fantastic"

35461,"mankind, the sixth century B.C. In this history thus far we have told"
35461,"very little of the early story of China. At present that early history"
35461,"is still very obscure, and we look to Chinese explorers and"
35461,"archæolologists in the new China that is now arising to work out their"
35461,"past as thoroughly as the European past has been worked out during the"
35461,"last century. Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizations"
35461,"arose in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic"
35461,"culture. They had, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general characteristics"
35461,"of that culture, and they centred upon temples in which priests and"
35461,"priest kings offered the seasonal blood sacrifices. The life in those"
35461,"cities must have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six"

35461,"America a thousand years ago."

35461,""
35461,"And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia were"
35461,"in conflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of the north,"
35461,"so the primitive Chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic"
35461,"peoples on their northern borders.  There was a number of tribes akin"
35461,"in language and ways of living, who are spoken of in history in"
35461,"succession as the Huns, the Mongols, the Turks and Tartars.  They"
35461,"changed and divided and combined and re-combined, just as the Nordic"
35461,"peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied in name"
35461,"rather than in nature.  These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than"
35461,"the Nordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of the Altai"
35461,"Mountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after"
35461,"1000 B.C. And just as in the western case so ever and again these"
35461,"eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the"
35461,"conquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and"
35461,"civilized region."
35461,""
35461,"It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not"
35461,"Mongolian at all any more than the earliest civilization of Europe and"
35461,"western Asia was Nordic or Semitic.  It is quite possible that the"
35461,"earliest civilization of China was a brunette civilization and of a"
35461,"piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations,"
35461,"and that when the first recorded history of China began there had"
35461,"already been conquests and intermixture.  At any rate we find that by"
35461,"1750 B.C. China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city"
35461,"states, all acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less"
35461,"regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest"
35461,"emperor, the “Son of Heaven.”  The “Shang” dynasty came to an end in"
35461,"1125 B.C.  A “Chow” dynasty succeeded “Shang,” and maintained China in"
35461,"a relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies"
35461,"in Egypt.  Gradually China went to pieces during that long “Chow”"
35461,"period.  Hunnish peoples came down and set up principalities; local"
35461,"rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.  There was in"
35461,"the sixth century B.C., says one Chinese authority, five or six"
35461,"thousand practically independent states in China.  It was what the"
35461,"Chinese call in their records an “Age of Confusion.”"

35461,"regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent; to provide sound rules for"

35461,"Epirus, which is across the Adriatic Sea over against the heel of"
35461,"Italy.  It was his ambition to play the part of Philip of Macedonia to"
35461,"Magna Græcia, and to become protector and master-general of Tarentum,"
35461,"Syracuse and the rest of that part of the world. He had what was then"
35461,"it very efficient modern army; he had an infantry phalanx, cavalry from"
35461,"Thessaly—which was now quite as good as the original Macedonian"
35461,"cavalry—and twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed the"
35461,"Romans in two considerable battles, Heraclea (280 B.C.) and Ausculum"
35461,"(279 B.C.), and having driven them north, he turned his attention to"
35461,"the subjugation of Sicily."
35461,""
35461,"But this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the"
35461,"Romans at that time, the Phœnician trading city of Carthage, which was"
35461,"probably then the greatest city in the world.  Sicily was too near"
35461,"Carthage for a new Alexander to be welcome there, and Carthage was"
35461,"mindful of the fate that had befallen her mother city Tyre half a"
35461,"century before.  So she sent a fleet to encourage or compel Rome to"
35461,"continue the struggle, and she cut the overseas communications of"
35461,"Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the Romans, and"
35461,"suffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon their camp"
35461,"at Beneventum between Naples and Rome."
35461,""
35461,"And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus.  The Gauls were"
35461,"raiding south.  But this time they were not raiding down into Italy;"
35461,"the Roman frontier, fortified and guarded, had become too formidable"
35461,"for them.  They were raiding down through Illyria (which is now Serbia"
35461,"and Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.  Repulsed by the Romans,"
35461,"endangered at sea by the Carthaginians, and threatened at home by the"
35461,"Gauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest and went home (275"
35461,"B.C.), and the power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina."
35461,""
35461,"On the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of Messina, and"
35461,"this presently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates.  The"
35461,"Carthaginians, who were already practically overlords of Sicily and"
35461,"allies of Syracuse, suppressed these pirates (270 B.C.) and put in a"
35461,"Carthaginian garrison there.  The pirates appealed to Rome and Rome"

35461,"was still doing good scientific work, and the barbaric Gauls were now"
35461,"in Asia Minor and exacting a tribute from Pergamum. The different"

35461,"the mortal fight that went on for a century and a half in Spain, Italy,"
35461,"North Africa and the western Mediterranean, between the last stronghold"
35461,"of Semitic power and Rome, this newcomer among Aryan-speaking peoples."
35461,""
35461,"That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world. "
35461,"Rome triumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of Aryan and Semite was"
35461,"to merge itself later on in the conflict of Gentile and Jew.  Our"
35461,"history now is coming to events whose consequences and distorted"
35461,"traditions still maintain a lingering and expiring vitality in, and"

35461,""
35461,"The First Punic War began in 264 B.C. about the pirates of Messina.  It"
35461,"developed into a struggle for the possession of all Sicily except the"
35461,"dominions of the Greek king of Syracuse.  The advantage of the sea was"
35461,"at first with the Carthaginians.  They had great fighting ships of what"
35461,"was hitherto an unheard-of size, quinqueremes, galleys with five banks"
35461,"of oars and a huge ram.  At the battle of Salamis, two centuries"
35461,"before, the leading battleships had only been triremes with three"
35461,"banks.  But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the"
35461,"fact that they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild"
35461,"the Carthaginians.  They manned the new navy they created chiefly with"
35461,"Greek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for"
35461,"the superior seamanship of the enemy. When the Carthaginian came up to"
35461,"ram or shear the oars of the Roman, huge grappling irons seized him and"
35461,"the Roman soldiers swarmed aboard him.  At Mylæ (260 B.C.) and at"
35461,"Ecnomus (256 B.C.) the Carthaginians were disastrously beaten. They"
35461,"repulsed a Roman landing near Carthage but were badly beaten at"
35461,"Palermo, losing one hundred and four elephants there—to grace such a"
35461,"triumphal procession through the Forum as Rome had never seen before. "
35461,"But after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.  The"
35461,"last naval forces of Carthage were defeated by it last Roman effort at"
35461,"the battle of the Ægatian Isles (241 B.C.) and Carthage sued for peace."

35461,"the Gods!_—and were routed at Telamon.  Rome pushed forward to the"
35461,"Alps, and even extended her dominions down the Adriatic coast to"
35461,"Illyria. Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revolts"
35461,"in Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less recuperative power. "

35461,"Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro.  To"
35461,"that boundary the Romans restricted them.  Any crossing of the Ebro by"
35461,"the Carthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the"
35461,"Romans.  At last in 218 B.C. the Carthaginians, provoked by new Roman"
35461,"aggressions, did cross this river under a young general named Hannibal,"
35461,"one of the most brilliant commanders in the whole of history.  He"
35461,"marched his army from Spain over the Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls"
35461,"against the Romans, and carried on the Second Punic War in Italy itself"
35461,"for fifteen years.  He inflicted tremendous defeats upon the Romans at"
35461,"Lake Trasimere and at Cannæ, and throughout all his Italian campaigns"
35461,"no Roman army stood against him and escaped disaster.  But a Roman army"
35461,"had landed at Marseilles and cut his communications with Spain; he had"
35461,"no siege train, and he could never capture Rome.  Finally the"
35461,"Carthaginians, threatened by the revolt of the Numidians at home, were"
35461,"forced back upon the defence of their own city in Africa, a Roman army"
35461,"crossed into Africa, and Hannibal experienced his first defeat under"
35461,"its walls at the battle of Zama (202 B.C. at the hands of Scipio"

35461,"Carthage capitulated; she surrendered Spain and her war fleet; she paid"
35461,"an enormous indemnity and agreed to give up Hannibal to the vengeance"

35461,"artificial of quarrels (149 B.C.), she made an obstinate and bitter"
35461,"resistance, stood a long siege and was stormed (146 B.C.). The street"

35461,"THE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE"
35461,""
35461,""
35461,"Now this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in"
35461,"the second and first centuries B.C. was in several respects a different"
35461,"thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the"
35461,"civilized world. It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the"
35461,"creation of any one great conqueror. It was not indeed the first of"
35461,"republican empires; Athens had dominated a group of Allies and"
35461,"dependents in the time of Pericles, and Carthage when she entered upon"
35461,"her fatal struggle with Rome was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica,"
35461,"Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily. But it was the"
35461,"first republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh"
35461,"developments."
35461,""
35461,"The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient"
35461,"centres of empire, which had hitherto been the river valleys of"
35461,"Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This westward position enabled Rome to bring in"
35461,"to civilization quite fresh regions and peoples. The Roman power"
35461,"extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently able to thrust"
35461,"north-westward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain and"
35461,"north-eastward into Hungary and South Russia.  But on the other hand it"
35461,"was never able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because"
35461,"they were too far from its administrative centres.  It included"
35461,"therefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryan- speaking peoples, it"
35461,"presently incorporated nearly all the Greek people in the world, and"
35461,"its population was less strongly Hamitic and Semitic than that of any"
35461,"preceding empire."
35461,""
35461,"For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of"
35461,"precedent that had so speedily swallowed up Persian and Greek, and all"
35461,"that time it developed.  The rulers of the Medes and Persians became"
35461,"entirely Babylonized in a generation or so; they took over the tiara of"
35461,"the king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of his gods;"
35461,"Alexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of"
35461,"assimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much the same court and"
35461,"administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the Ptolemies became Pharaohs"
35461,"and altogether Egyptian.  They were assimilated just as before them the"
35461,"Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been assimilated.  But the"
35461,"Romans ruled in their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws"
35461,"of their own nature.  The only people who exercised any great mental"
35461,"influence upon them before the second or third century A.D. were the"
35461,"kindred and similar Greeks.  So that the Roman Empire was essentially a"
35461,"first attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryan lines.  It was"
35461,"so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic. "
35461,"The old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that"
35461,"had grown up round the temple of a harvest god did not apply to it. "
35461,"The Romans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their"
35461,"gods were quasi-human immortals, divine patricians.  The Romans also"
35461,"had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in times of stress,"
35461,"things they may have learnt to do from their dusky Etruscan teachers;"
35461,"but until Rome was long past its zenith neither priest nor temple"
35461,"played a large part in Roman history."

35461,"The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the Roman"
35461,"people found themselves engaged almost unawares in a vast"
35461,"administrative experiment.  It cannot be called a successful"
35461,"experiment.  In the end their empire collapsed altogether.  And it"
35461,"changed enormously in form and method from century to century.  It"
35461,"changed more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt"
35461,"changed in a thousand. It was always changing.  It never attained to"
35461,"any fixity."

35461,"unfinished, and Europe and America to-day are still working out the"
35461,"riddles of world-wide statescraft first confronted by the Roman people."
35461,""
35461,"It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great"
35461,"changes not only in political but in social and moral matters that went"
35461,"on throughout the period of Roman dominion.  There is much too strong a"
35461,"tendency in people’s minds to think of the Roman rule as something"
35461,"finished and stable, firm, rounded, noble and decisive.  Macaulay’s"
35461,"_Lays of Ancient Rome_, S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius"
35461,"Cæsar, Diocletian, Constantine the Great, triumphs, orations,"
35461,"gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up together in"
35461,"a picture of something high and cruel and dignified.  The items of that"
35461,"picture have to be disentangled.  They are collected at different"
35461,"points from a process of change profounder than that which separates"
35461,"the London of William the Conqueror from the London of to-day."
35461,""
35461,"We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages."
35461," The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in 390 B.C."
35461,"and went on until the end of the First Punic War (240 B.C,).  We may"
35461,"call this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.  It was perhaps"
35461,"the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history.  The age-long"
35461,"dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to it close, the"
35461,"Etruscan threat had come to an end, no one was very rich yet nor very"
35461,"poor, and most men were public-spirited.  It was a republic like the"
35461,"republic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern"
35461,"states of the American union between 1800 and 1850; a free- farmers"
35461,"republic.  At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely"
35461,"twenty miles square.  She fought the sturdy but kindred states about"
35461,"her, and sought not their destruction but coalescence.  Her centuries"
35461,"of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and"
35461,"concessions.  Some of the defeated cities became altogether Roman with"
35461,"a voting share in the government, some became self-governing with the"
35461,"right to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full of citizens were set"
35461,"up at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded among"
35461,"the freshly conquered people.  Great roads were made.  The rapid"
35461,"Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a"
35461,"policy.  In 89 B.C. all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens"
35461,"of the city of Rome.  Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an"
35461,"extended city.  In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire extent of the"
35461,"empire was given citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote"
35461,"in the town meeting in Rome."
35461,""
35461,"This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole"
35461,"countries was the distinctive device of Roman expansion.  It reversed"
35461,"the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.  By the Roman"

35461,"But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the"

35461,"side.  Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey.  It was"
35461,"declared an “estate” of the Roman people.  Its rich soil and"
35461,"industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.  The patricians"
35461,"and the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of"
35461,"that wealth.  And the war also brought in a large supply of slaves. "
35461,"Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had been"
35461,"largely a population of citizen farmers.  Military service was their"
35461,"privilege and liability.  While they were on active service their farms"
35461,"fell into debt and a new large-scale slave agriculture grew up; when"
35461,"they returned they found their produce in competition with slave-grown"
35461,"produce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.  Times had"
35461,"changed.  The republic had altered its character.  Not only was Sicily"
35461,"in the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of the rich"

35461,"The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated. The"
35461,"governing bodies of the Roman republic were two in number.  The first"
35461,"and more important was the Senate.  This was a body originally of"
35461,"patricians and then of prominent men of all sorts, who were summoned to"
35461,"it first by certain powerful officials, the consuls and censors.  Like"
35461,"the British House of Lords it became a gathering of great landowners,"

35461,"For three centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of"

35461,"possible gathering.  When the citizenship of Rome had spread beyond the"
35461,"confines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one.  Its meetings,"
35461,"proclaimed by horn-blowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became"
35461,"more and more a gathering of political hacks and city riff-raff.  In"
35461,"the fourth century B.C. the Popular Assembly was a considerable check"
35461,"upon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims and rights of"
35461,"the common man.  By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic"

35461,"of proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part.  There was revolt"
35461,"and civil war.  In 73 B.C., the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a"
35461,"great insurrection, of the slaves under Spartacus.  The slaves of Italy"
35461,"revolted with some effect, for among them were the trained fighters of"
35461,"the gladiatorial shows.  For two years Spartacus held out in the crater"
35461,"of Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano. This"
35461,"insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with frantic cruelty. "
35461,"Six thousand captured Spartacists were crucified along the Appian Way,"
35461,"the great highway that runs southward out of Rome (71 B.C.)."

35461,"The common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating"
35461,"and degrading him.  But the big rich men who were overcoming him were"
35461,"even in his defeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over"
35461,"themselves and him, the power of the army."
35461,""
35461,"Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free"
35461,"farmers, who, according to their quality, rode or marched afoot to"
35461,"battle.  This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but not the"
35461,"sort of army that will go abroad and bear long campaigns with patience."
35461," And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the supply"
35461,"of free- spirited fighting farmers declined.  It was a popular leader"
35461,"named Marius who introduced a new factor.  North Africa after the"
35461,"overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semi-barbaric"
35461,"kingdom, the kingdom of Numidia.  The Roman power fell into conflict"
35461,"with Jugurtha, king of this state, and experienced enormous"
35461,"difficulties in subduing him. Marius was made consul, in a phase of"
35461,"public indignation, to end this discreditable war.  This he did by"
35461,"raising _paid troops_ and drilling them hard.  Jugurtha was brought in"
35461,"chains to Rome (106 B.C.) and Marius, when his time of office had"
35461,"expired, held on to his consulship illegally with his newly created"
35461,"legions.  There was no power in Rome to restrain him."
35461,""
35461,"With Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman"
35461,"power, the Republic of the Military Commanders.  For now began a period"
35461,"in which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the mastery of the"
35461,"Roman world.  Against Marius was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had"
35461,"served under him in Africa.  Each in turn made a great massacre of his"
35461,"political opponents.  Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand,"
35461,"and their estates were sold.  After the bloody rivalry of these two and"
35461,"the horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in which Lucullus"
35461,"and Pompey the Great and Crassus and Julius Cæsar were the masters of"
35461,"armies and dominated affairs.  It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus. "
35461,"Lucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired"
35461,"with great wealth into private life.  Crassus thrusting further invaded"
35461,"Persia and was defeated and slain by the Parthians.  After a long"
35461,"rivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius Cæsar (48 B.C.) and murdered in"
35461,"Egypt, leaving Julius Cæsar sole master of the Roman world."
35461,""
35461,"The figure of Julius Cæsar is one that has stirred the human"
35461,"imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true importance.  He"
35461,"has become a legend and a symbol.  For us he is chiefly important as"
35461,"marking the transition from the phase of military adventurers to the"
35461,"beginning of the fourth stage in Roman expansion, the Early Empire. "
35461,"For in spite of the profoundest economic and political convulsions, in"
35461,"spite of civil war and social degeneration, throughout all this time"
35461,"the boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued to creep"
35461,"outward to their maximum about 100 A.D.  There had been something like"
35461,"an ebb during the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a"
35461,"manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by"
35461,"Marius. The revolt of Spartacus marked a third phase.  Julius Cæsar"
35461,"made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul, which is now France"
35461,"and Belgium.  (The chief tribes inhabiting this country belonged to the"
35461,"same Celtic people as the Gauls who had occupied north Italy for a"
35461,"time, and who had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as"
35461,"the Galatians.)  Cæsar drove back a German invasion of Gaul and added"
35461,"all that country to the empire, and he twice crossed the Straits of"
35461,"Dover into Britain (55 and 54 B.C.), where however he made no permanent"
35461,"conquest.  Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests"
35461,"that reached in the east to the Caspian Sea."

35461,"of politicians, among whom Cicero was an outstanding figure, were"
35461,"struggling to preserve the great traditions of republican Rome and to"

35461,"of slaves and impoverished men with neither the understanding nor the"

35461,"It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military"
35461,"extremity, to elect a “dictator” with practically unlimited powers to"
35461,"rule through the crisis. After his overthrow of Pompey, Cæsar was made"
35461,"dictator first for ten years and then (in 45 B.C.) for life.  In effect"
35461,"he was made monarch of the empire for life.  There was talk of a king,"
35461,"a word abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion of the Etruscans five"
35461,"centuries before.  Cæsar refused to be king, but adopted throne and"
35461,"sceptre.  After his defeat of Pompey, Cæsar had gone on into Egypt and"
35461,"had made love to Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess"
35461,"queen of Egypt.  She seems to have turned his head very completely.  He"
35461,"had brought back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a god-king.  His statue"

35461,"Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities"
35461,"followed.  There was a second Triumvirate of Lepidus, Mark Antony and"
35461,"Octavian Cæsar, the latter the nephew of Julius Cæsar.  Octavian like"
35461,"his uncle took the poorer, hardier western provinces where the best"

35461,"serious rival, at the naval battle of Actium, and made himself sole"
35461,"master of the Roman world.  But Octavian was a man of different quality"
35461,"altogether from Julius Cæsar.  He had no foolish craving to be God or"
35461,"King.  He had no queen-lover that he wished to dazzle.  He restored"
35461,"freedom to the Senate and people of Rome.  He declined to be dictator. "
35461,"The grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms"
35461,"of power. He was to be called not King indeed, but “Princeps” and"
35461,"“Augustus.”  He became Augustus Cæsar, the first of the Roman emperors"
35461,"(27 B.C. to 14 A.D.)."

35461,"The second and first centuries B.C. mark a new phase in the history of"

35461,"centre of interest. Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were still fertile,"
35461,"populous and fairly prosperous, but they were no longer the dominant"
35461,"regions of the world. Power had drifted to the west and to the east."
35461,"Two great empires now dominated the world, this new Roman Empire and"
35461,"the renascent Empire of China. Rome extended its power to the"
35461,"Euphrates, but it was never able to get beyond that boundary. It was"
35461,"too remote. Beyond the Euphrates the former Persian and Indian"
35461,"dominions of the Seleucids fell under a number of new masters. China,"
35461,"now under the Han dynasty, which had replaced the Ts’in dynasty at the"
35461,"death of Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its power across Tibet and over the"
35461,"high mountain passes of the Pamirs into western Turkestan. But there,"

35461,"Yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way, and their"

35461,"trickled through, by camel caravans across Persia, for example, and by"
35461,"coasting ships by way of India and the Red Sea.  In 66 B.C. Roman"

35461,"and marched up the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea.  In 102 A.D. a"

35461,"very great local differences and great contrasts and inequalities of"
35461,"culture between one district and another, just as there are to-day"

35461,"indeed but managing their own affairs, and, for a time at least,"
35461,"worshipping their own gods in their own fashion.  Over Greece, Asia"

35461,"In such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like Dacia (now"
35461,"roughly Roumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of the Danube), where"
35461,"there were no pre-existing great cities and temples and cultures, the"
35461,"Roman empire did however “Latinize.”  It civilized these countries for"
35461,"the first time.  It created cities and towns where Latin was from the"
35461,"first the dominant speech, and where Roman gods were served and Roman"
35461,"customs and fashions followed.  The Roumanian, Italian, French and"
35461,"Spanish languages, all variations and modifications of Latin, remain to"
35461,"remind us of this extension of Latin speech and customs.  North-west"
35461,"Africa also became at last largely Latin-speaking.  Egypt, Greece and"
35461,"the rest of the empire to the east were never Latinized.  They remained"
35461,"Egyptian and Greek in culture and spirit.  And even in Rome, among"
35461,"educated men, Greek was learnt as the language of a gentleman and Greek"
35461,"literature and learning were very, properly preferred to Latin."
35461,""
35461,"In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were"
35461,"naturally also very miscellaneous.  The chief industry of the settled"
35461,"world was still largely agriculture. We have told how in Italy the"
35461,"sturdy free farmers who were the backbone of the early Roman republic"
35461,"were replaced by estates worked by slave labour after the Punic wars. "
35461,"The Greek world had had very various methods of cultivation, from the"
35461,"Arcadian plan, wherein every free citizen toiled with his own hands, to"
35461,"Sparta, wherein it was a dishonour to work and where agricultural work"
35461,"was done by a special slave class, the Helots.  But that was ancient"
35461,"history now, and over most of the Hellenized world the estate system"
35461,"and slave-gangs had spread.  The agricultural slaves were captives who"
35461,"spoke many different languages so that they could not understand each"
35461,"other, or they were born slaves; they had no solidarity to resist"
35461,"oppression, no tradition of rights, no knowledge, for they could not"
35461,"read nor write.  Although they came to form a majority of the country"
35461,"population they never made a successful insurrection.  The insurrection"
35461,"of Spartacus in the first century B.C. was an insurrection of the"
35461,"special slaves who were trained for the gladiatorial combats. The"
35461,"agricultural workers in Italy in the latter days of the Republic and"
35461,"the early Empire suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained"
35461,"at night to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it"
35461,"difficult.  They had no wives of their own; they could be outraged,"
35461,"mutilated and killed by their masters.  A master could sell his slave"
35461,"to fight beasts in the arena.  If a slave slew his master, all the"
35461,"slaves in his household and not merely the murderer were crucified.  In"
35461,"some parts of Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of the slave was never"
35461,"quite so frightful as this, but it was still detestable.  To such a"
35461,"population the barbarian invaders who presently broke through the"
35461,"defensive line of the legions, came not as enemies but as liberators."

35461,"workers; but we do not know what proportion they made of the general"
35461,"population.  It probably varied widely in different places and at"

35461,"farm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous to"

35461,"every great Roman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators, who sometimes"

35461,"bodyguard of bullies.  And also there were learned slaves.  The"
35461,"conquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities"
35461,"of Greece, North Africa and Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly"
35461,"educated captives. The tutor of a young Roman of good family was"
35461,"usually a slave.  A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and"
35461,"slave secretaries and learned men.  He would keep his poet as he would"
35461,"keep a performing dog.  In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of"
35461,"modern literary criticism were evolved.  The slaves still boast and"
35461,"quarrel in our reviews. There were enterprising people who bought"
35461,"intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale.  Slaves were"

35461,"during the four hundred years between the opening days of conquest"
35461,"under the republic of rich men and the days of disintegration that"
35461,"followed the great pestilence.  In the second century B.C. war-captives"
35461,"were abundant, manners gross and brutal; the slave had no rights and"
35461,"there was scarcely an outrage the reader can imagine that was not"
35461,"practised upon slaves in those days.  But already in the first century"
35461,"A.D. there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman"
35461,"civilization towards slavery.  Captives were not so abundant for one"
35461,"thing, and slaves were dearer.  And slave- owners began to realize that"
35461,"the profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the"
35461,"self-respect of these unfortunates.  But also the moral tone of the"
35461,"community was rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective. "
35461,"The higher mentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman harshness. "
35461,"Restrictions upon cruelty were made, a master might no longer sell his"
35461,"slave to fight beasts, a slave was given property rights in what was"
35461,"called his _peculium_, slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and"
35461,"stimulus, a form of slave marriage was recognized.  Very many forms of"
35461,"agriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or require gang"
35461,"workers only at certain seasons.  In regions where such conditions"
35461,"prevailed the slave presently became a serf, paying his owner part of"
35461,"his produce or working for him at certain seasons."

35461,"When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and"

35461,"state and how small was the minority who had any pride or freedom in"
35461,"their lives, we lay our hands on the clues to its decay and collapse. "
35461,"There was little of what we should call family life, few homes of"
35461,"temperate living and active thought and study; schools and colleges"
35461,"were few and far between.  The free will and the free mind were nowhere"

35461,"tradition of law and power it left for the astonishment of succeeding"
35461,"generations must not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was"
35461,"built upon thwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and"
35461,"perverted desires.  And even the minority who lorded it over that wide"
35461,"realm of subjugation and of restraint and forced labour were uneasy and"
35461,"unhappy in their souls; art and literature, science and philosophy,"
35461,"which are the fruits of free and happy minds, waned in that atmosphere."

35461,"The soul of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the first two"
35461,"centuries of the Christian era was a worried and frustrated soul."
35461,"Compulsion and cruelty reigned; there were pride and display but little"
35461,"honour; little serenity or steadfast happiness. The unfortunate were"
35461,"despised and wretched; the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager"
35461,"for gratifications. In a great number of cities life centred on the red"
35461,"excitement of the arena, where men and beasts fought and were tormented"
35461,"and slain. Amphitheatres are the most characteristic of Roman ruins."
35461,"Life went on in that key. The uneasiness of men’s hearts manifested"
35461,"itself in profound religious unrest."
35461,""
35461,"From the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the ancient"
35461,"civilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of the temples and"
35461,"priesthoods should suffer great adaptations or disappear.  In the"
35461,"course of hundreds of generations the agricultural peoples of the"
35461,"brunette civilizations had shaped their lives and thoughts to the"
35461,"temple-centred life. Observances and the fear of disturbed routines,"
35461,"sacrifices and mysteries, dominated their minds.  Their gods seem"
35461,"monstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong to an"
35461,"Aryanized world, but to these older peoples these deities had the"
35461,"immediate conviction and vividness of things seen in an intense dream. "
35461,"The conquest of one city state by another in Sumeria or early Egypt"
35461,"meant a change or a renaming of gods or goddesses, but left the shape"
35461,"and spirit of the worship intact.  There was no change in its general"
35461,"character.  The figures in the dream changed, but the dream went on and"
35461,"it was the same sort of dream.  And the early Semitic conquerors were"
35461,"sufficiently akin in spirit to the Sumerians to take over the religion"
35461,"of the Mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without any profound"
35461,"alteration. Egypt was never indeed subjugated to the extent of a"
35461,"religious revolution.  Under the Ptolemies and under the Cæsars, her"
35461,"temples and altars and priesthoods remained essentially Egyptian."
35461,""
35461,"So long as conquests went on between people of similar social and"
35461,"religious habits it was possible to get over the clash between the god"
35461,"of this temple and region and the god of that by a process of grouping"
35461,"or assimilation.  If the two gods were alike in character they were"
35461,"identified.  It was really the same god under another name, said the"
35461,"priests and the people.  This fusion of gods is called theocrasia; and"
35461,"the age of the great conquests of the thousand years B.C. was an age of"
35461,"theocrasia.  Over wide areas the local gods were displaced by, or"
35461,"rather they were swallowed up in, a general god.  So that when at last"
35461,"Hebrew prophets in Babylon proclaimed one God of Righteousness in all"
35461,"the earth men’s minds were fully prepared for that idea."
35461,""
35461,"But often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation, and"
35461,"then they were grouped together in some plausible relationship.  A"
35461,"female god - and the Ægean world before the coming of the Greek was"
35461,"much addicted to Mother Gods—would be married to a male god, and an"
35461,"animal god or a star god would be humanized and the animal or"
35461,"astronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or the star, made into an"
35461,"ornament or a symbol.  Or the god of a defeated people would become a"
35461,"malignant antagonist to the brighter gods.  The history of theology is"
35461,"full of such adaptations, compromises and rationalizations of once"
35461,"local gods."
35461,""
35461,"As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was"
35461,"much of this theocrasia.  The chief god so to speak was Osiris, a"
35461,"sacrificial harvest god of whom Pharaoh was supposed to be the earthly"
35461,"incarnation.  Osiris was represented as repeatedly dying and rising"
35461,"again; he was not only the seed and the harvest but also by a natural"
35461,"extension of thought the means of human immortality.  Among his symbols"
35461,"was the wide-winged scarabeus beetle which buries its eggs to rise"
35461,"again, and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise. Later on he was"
35461,"to be identified with Apis, the sacred bull. Associated with him was"
35461,"the goddess Isis.  Isis was also Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the"
35461,"crescent moon and the Star of the sea.  Osiris dies and she bears a"
35461,"child, Horus, who is also a hawk-god and the dawn, and who grows to"
35461,"become Osiris again.  The effigies of Isis represent her as bearing the"
35461,"infant Horus in her arms and standing on the crescent moon.  These are"
35461,"not logical relationships, but they were devised by the human mind"
35461,"before the development of hard and systematic thinking and they have a"
35461,"dream-like coherence.  Beneath this triple group there are other and"
35461,"darker Egyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis, black night and"

35461,"whole Hellenic world.  A great temple, the Serapeum, was set up by"
35461,"Ptolemy I at which a sort of trinity of gods was worshipped. These were"
35461,"Serapis (who was Osiris-Apis rechristened), Isis and Horus. These were"
35461,"not regarded as separate gods but as three aspects of one god, and"
35461,"Serapis was identified with the Greek Zeus, the Roman Jupiter and the"
35461,"Persian sun-god.  This worship spread wherever the Hellenic influence"

35461,"immortality, an immortality of compensations and consolation, was"
35461,"eagerly received by a world in which the common life was hopelessly"
35461,"wretched.  Serapis was called “the saviour of souls.”  “After death,”"

35461,"providence.”  Isis attracted many devotees.  Her images stood in her"

35461,"shaven priests consecrated to celibacy waited on her altar."

35461,"growing cult.  The temples of Serapis-Isis, the chanting of the priests"
35461,"and the hope of immortal life, followed the Roman standards to Scotland"
35461,"and Holland.  But there were many rivals to the Serapis-Isis religion."
35461,"Prominent among these was Mithraism.  This was a religion of Persian"
35461,"origin, and it centred upon some now forgotten mysteries about Mithras"
35461,"sacrificing a sacred and benevolent bull.  Here we seem to have"
35461,"something more primordial than the complicated and sophisticated"
35461,"Serapis-Isis beliefs.  We are carried back directly to the blood"
35461,"sacrifices of the heliolithic stage in human culture.  The bull upon"
35461,"the Mithraic monuments always bleeds copiously from a wound in its"
35461,"side, and from this blood springs new life.  The votary to Mithraism"
35461,"actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull.  At his"
35461,"initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which a bull was killed"
35461,"so that the blood could actually run down on him."

35461,"Both these religions, and the same is true of many other of the"

35461,"They aim at personal salvation and personal immortality.  The older"

35461,"needs in this world in which we live.  But the Greeks first and now the"

35461," A typical city under the earlier Roman emperors would have a number of"
35461,"temples to all sorts of gods.  There might be a temple to Jupiter of"
35461,"the Capitol, the great god of Rome, and there would probably be one to"
35461,"the reigning Cæsar.  For the Cæsars had learnt from the Pharaohs the"
35461,"possibility of being gods.  In such temples a cold and stately"

35461,"pinch of incense to show one’s loyalty.  But it would be to the temple"
35461,"of Isis, the dear Queen of Heaven, one would go with the burthen of"
35461,"one’s private troubles for advice and relief.  There might be local and"
35461,"eccentric gods.  Seville, for example, long affected the worship of the"
35461,"old Carthaginian Venus.  In a cave or an underground temple there would"

35461,"In the East long before the time of Buddha there had been ascetics, men"

35461,"We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult accessories,"
35461,"with the figure of a being, very human, very earnest and passionate,"
35461,"capable of swift anger, and teaching a new and simple and profound"
35461,"doctrine—namely, the universal loving Fatherhood of God and the coming"
35461,"of the Kingdom of Heaven.  He was clearly a person—to use a common"
35461,"phrase—of intense personal magnetism.  He attracted followers and"
35461,"filled them with love and courage. Weak and ailing people were"
35461,"heartened and healed by his presence.  Yet he was probably of a"
35461,"delicate physique, because of the swiftness with which he died under"
35461,"the pains of crucifixion.  There is a tradition that he fainted when,"
35461,"according to the custom, he was made to bear his cross to the place of"
35461,"execution.  He went about the country for three years spreading his"
35461,"doctrine and then he came to Jerusalem and was accused of trying to set"

35461,"The doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching of"

35461,"that time failed to grasp its full significance, and recoiled in dismay"
35461,"from even a half apprehension of its tremendous challenges to the"
35461,"established habits and institutions of mankind.  For the doctrine of"
35461,"the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, was no less"
35461,"than a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete change and"
35461,"cleansing of the life of our struggling race, an utter cleansing,"
35461,"without and within.  To the gospels the reader must go for all that is"

35461,"The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole world, was a"
35461,"righteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god who had"
35461,"made a bargain with their Father Abraham about them, a very good"
35461,"bargain indeed for them, to bring them at last to predominance in the"
35461,"earth. With dismay and anger they heard Jesus sweeping away their dear"
35461,"securities.  God, he taught, was no bargainer; there were no chosen"
35461,"people and no favourites in the Kingdom of Heaven.  God was the loving"
35461,"father of all life, as incapable of showing favour as the universal"
35461,"sun.  And all men were brothers—sinners alike and beloved sons alike—of"
35461,"this divine father.  In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus cast"
35461,"scorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own people"
35461,"and to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other races.  In"
35461,"the parable of the labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of the"
35461,"Jews to have a special claim upon God. All whom God takes into the"
35461,"kingdom, he taught, God serves alike; there is no distinction in his"
35461,"treatment, because there is no measure to his bounty.  From all"
35461,"moreover, as the parable of the buried talent witnesses, and as the"
35461,"incident of the widow’s mite enforces, he demands the utmost. There are"

35461,"that the broad lines of Christian belief are laid down."
35461,""
35461,"Chief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St. Paul. He had never"
35461,"seen Jesus nor heard him preach.  Paul’s name was originally Saul, and"
35461,"he was conspicuous at first as an active persecutor of the little band"
35461,"of disciples after the crucifixion.  Then he was suddenly converted to"
35461,"Christianity, and he changed his name to Paul.  He was a man of great"
35461,"intellectual vigour and deeply and passionately interested in the"
35461,"religious movements of the time.  He was well versed in Judaism and in"
35461,"the Mithraism and Alexandrian religion of the day.  He carried over"
35461,"many of their ideas and terms of expression into Christianity.  He did"
35461,"very little to enlarge or develop the original teaching of Jesus, the"
35461,"teaching of the Kingdom of Heaven.  But he taught that Jesus was not"
35461,"only the promised Christ, the promised leader of the Jews, but also"
35461,"that his death was a sacrifice, like the deaths of the ancient"
35461,"sacrificial victims of the primordial civilizations, for the redemption"
35461,"of mankind."
35461,""
35461,"When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each other’s"
35461,"ceremonial and other outward peculiarities.  Buddhism, for example, in"
35461,"China has now almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as"
35461,"Taoism, which follows in the teachings of Lao Tse.  Yet the original"
35461,"teachings of Buddhism and Taoism were almost flatly opposed.  And it"
35461,"reflects no doubt or discredit upon the essentials of Christian"
35461,"teaching that it took over not merely such formal things as the shaven"
35461,"priest, the votive offering, the altars, candles, chanting and images"
35461,"of the Alexandrian and Mithraic faiths, but adopted even their"
35461,"devotional phrases and their theological ideas.  All these religions"
35461,"were flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults. Each was"
35461,"seeking adherents, and there must have been a constant going and coming"
35461,"of converts between them. Sometimes one or other would be in favour"
35461,"with the government.  But Christianity was regarded with more suspicion"

35461,"to mark a new stage in human history. Until the last century or so"
35461,"before the Christian era, the Mongol and the Nordic peoples had not"
35461,"been in close touch. Far away in the frozen lands beyond the northern"
35461,"forests the Lapps, a Mongolian people, had drifted westward as far as"
35461,"Lapland, but they played no part in the main current of history. For"
35461,"thousands of years the western world carried on the dramatic interplay"

35461,"interference (except for an Ethiopian invasion of Egypt or so) either"
35461,"from the black peoples to the south or from the Mongolian world in the"
35461,"far East."
35461,""
35461,"It is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward"
35461,"drift of the nomadic Mongolians.  One was the consolidation of the"
35461,"great empire of China, its extension northward and the increase of its"
35461,"population during the prosperous period of the Han dynasty.  The other"
35461,"was some process of climatic change; a lesser rainfall that abolished"
35461,"swamps and forests perhaps, or a greater rainfall that extended grazing"
35461,"over desert steppes, or even perhaps both these processes going on in"
35461,"different regions but which anyhow facilitated a westward migration.  A"
35461,"third contributary cause was the economic wretchedness, internal decay"
35461,"and falling population of the Roman Empire.  The rich men of the later"
35461,"Roman Republic, and then the tax-gatherers of the military emperors had"
35461,"utterly consumed its vitality. So we have the factors of thrust, means"
35461,"and opportunity. There was pressure from the east, rot in the west and"
35461,"an open road."

35461,"The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by the"
35461,"first century A.D., but it was not until the fourth and fifth centuries"
35461,"A.D. that these horsemen rose to predominance upon the steppes.  The"

35461,"tributary Germanic tribes; his empire extended from the Rhine cross the"
35461,"plains into Central Asia.  He exchanged ambassadors with China.  His"
35461,"head camp was in the plain of Hungary east of the Danube. There he was"
35461,"visited by an envoy from Constantinople, Priscus, who has left us an"
35461,"account of his state.  The way of living of these Mongols was very like"
35461,"the way of living of the primitive Aryans they had replaced.  The"
35461,"common folk were in huts and tents; the chiefs lived in great stockaded"
35461,"timber halls.  There were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards."

35461,"had played long ago to the Ægean civilization.  It looked like history"

35461,"the Latin- speaking half of the empire and invaded Gaul.  Nearly every"
35461,"town in northern Gaul was sacked.  Franks, Visigoths and the imperial"

35461,"willing to make sacrifices in the name of Rome.  The prestige of Rome"
35461,"as of something just and great and law- upholding spread far beyond the"
35461,"Roman boundaries.  But even as early as the Punic wars the sense of"
35461,"citizenship was being undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery. "
35461,"Citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship."
35461,""
35461,"The Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization; it did"
35461,"not educate, did not explain itself to its increasing multitudes of"
35461,"citizens, did not invite their co-operation in its decisions.  There"
35461,"was no network of schools to ensure a common understanding, no"
35461,"distribution of news to sustain collective activity.  The adventurers"
35461,"who struggled for power from the days of Marius and Sulla onward had no"
35461,"idea of creating and calling in public opinion upon the imperial"
35461,"affairs.  The spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no one"
35461,"observed it die.  All empires, all states, all organizations of human"
35461,"society are, in the ultimate, things of understanding and will.  There"
35461,"remained no will for the Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an"

35461,"But though the Latin-speaking Roman Empire died in the fifth century,"
35461,"something else had been born within it that was to avail itself"

35461,"A prophetic amateur of history surveying the world in the opening of"
35461,"the seventh century might have concluded very reasonably that it was"
35461,"only a question of a few centuries before the whole of Europe and Asia"
35461,"fell under Mongolian domination. There were no signs of order or union"
35461,"in Western Europe, and the Byzantine and Persian Empires were"
35461,"manifestly bent upon a mutual destruction. India also was divided and"
35461,"wasted. On the other hand China was a steadily expanding empire which"
35461,"probably at that time exceeded all Europe in population, and the"
35461,"Turkish people who were growing to power in Central Asia were disposed"
35461,"to work in accord with China. And such a prophecy would not have been"
35461,"an altogether vain one. A time was to come in the thirteenth century"
35461,"when a Mongolian overlord would rule from the Danube to the Pacific,"

35461,"and Persian Empires, over Egypt and most of India."

35461,"small and bickering nomadic tribes.  No Semitic people had founded an"
35461,"empire now for more than a thousand years."

35461,"Then suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of splendour. "
35461,"They spread their rule and language from Spain to the boundaries of"

35461,"The man who fired this Arab flame appears first in history as the young"
35461,"husband of the widow of a rich merchant of the town of Mecca, named"
35461,"Muhammad.  Until he was forty he did very little to distinguish himself"
35461,"in the world.  He seems to have taken considerable interest in"

35461,"in particular a black stone, the Kaaba, of great repute throughout all"
35461,"Arabia and a centre of pilgrimages; but there were great numbers of"

35461,"those of the Hebrew prophets twelve hundred years before him.  He"
35461,"talked first to his wife of the One True God, and of the rewards and"
35461,"punishments of virtue and wickedness.  There can be no doubt that his"
35461,"thoughts were very strongly influenced by Jewish and Christian ideas. "
35461,"He gathered about him a small circle of believers and presently began"

35461,"extremely unpopular with his fellow townsmen because the pilgrimages to"
35461,"the Kaaba were the chief source of such prosperity as Mecca enjoyed. "
35461,"He became bolder and more definite in his teaching, declaring himself"
35461,"to be the last chosen prophet of God entrusted with a mission to"
35461,"perfect religion.  Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his"
35461,"forerunners.  He had been chosen to complete and perfect the revelation"

35461,"Yet when the manifest defects of Muhammad’s life and writings have been"

35461,"monotheism; its simple enthusiastic faith in the rule and fatherhood of"
35461,"God and its freedom from theological complications.  Another is its"
35461,"complete detachment from the sacrificial priest and the temple.  It is"
35461,"an entirely prophetic religion, proof against any possibility of"
35461,"relapse towards blood sacrifices.  In the Koran the limited and"
35461,"ceremonial nature of the pilgrimage to Mecca is stated beyond the"
35461,"possibility of dispute, and every precaution was taken by Muhammad to"
35461,"prevent the deification of himself after his death.  And a third"

35461,"Bekr was its conscience and its will.  Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu"
35461,"Bekr sustained him.  And when Muhammad died, Abu Bekr became Caliph (="

35461,"gradually and steadily a new social order and preparing unconsciously"
35461,"for the recovery of a power even more extensive than that they had"
35461,"previously enjoyed."
35461,""
35461,"We have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there remained"
35461,"no central government in Western Europe at all. That world was divided"
35461,"up among numbers of local rulers holding their own as they could.  This"
35461,"was too insecure a state of affairs to last; a system of co-operation"
35461,"and association grew up in this disorder, the feudal system, which has"
35461,"left its traces upon European life up to the present time.  This feudal"
35461,"system was a sort of crystallization of society about power. "
35461,"Everywhere the lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a"
35461,"certain amount of his liberty for help and protection.  He sought a"
35461,"stronger man as his lord and protector; he gave him military services"
35461,"and paid him dues, and in return he was confirmed in his possession of"
35461,"what was his.  His lord again found safety in vassalage to a still"
35461,"greater lord.  Cities also found it convenient to have feudal"
35461,"protectors, and monasteries and church estates bound themselves by"
35461,"similar ties.  No doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed before it"
35461,"was offered; the system grew downward as well as upward.  So a sort of"
35461,"pyramidal system grew up, varying widely in different localities,"
35461,"permitting at first a considerable play of violence and private warfare"
35461,"but making steadily for order and a new reign of law.  The pyramids"
35461,"grew up until some became recognizable as kingdoms.  Already by the"
35461,"early sixth century a Frankish kingdom existed under its founder Clovis"
35461,"in what is now France and the Netherlands, and presently Visigothic and"
35461,"Lombard and Gothic kingdoms were in existence."

35461,"decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands.  This Charles Martel"
35461,"was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees"
35461,"to Hungary.  He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking"
35461,"French- Latin, and High and Low German languages.  His son Pepin"
35461,"extinguished the last descendants of Clovis and took the kingly state"
35461,"and title.  His grandson Charlemagne, who began to reign in 768, found"
35461,"himself lord of a realm so large that he could think of reviving the"
35461,"title of Latin Emperor.  He conquered North Italy and made himself"
35461,"master of Rome."

35461,"Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons of a"
35461,"world history we can see much more distinctly than the mere nationalist"
35461,"historian how cramping and disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman"
35461,"Empire was.  A narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance"
35461,"was to consume European energy for more than a thousand years. Through"
35461,"all that period it is possible to trace certain unquenchable"
35461,"antagonisms; they run through the wits of Europe like the obsessions of"
35461,"a demented mind.  One driving force was this ambition of successful"
35461,"rulers, which Charlemagne (Charles the Great) embodied, to become"
35461,"Cæsar.  The realm of Charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal"
35461,"German states at various stages of barbarism.  West of the Rhine, most"
35461,"of these German peoples had learnt to speak various Latinized dialects"
35461,"which fused at last to form French.  East of the Rhine, the racially"
35461,"similar German peoples did not lose their German speech.  On account of"
35461,"this, communication was difficult between these two groups of barbarian"
35461,"conquerors and a split easily brought about.  The split was made the"
35461,"more easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it seem natural to"
35461,"divide the empire of Charlemagne among his sons at his death.  So one"
35461,"aspect of the history of Europe from the days of Charlemagne onwards is"
35461,"a history of first this monarch and his family and then that,"
35461,"struggling to a precarious headship of the kings, princes, dukes,"
35461,"bishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily deepening antagonism"
35461,"between the French and German speaking elements develops in the medley."
35461," There was a formality of election for each emperor; and the climax of"
35461,"his ambition was to struggle to the possession of that worn-out,"
35461,"misplaced capital Rome and to a coronation there."
35461,""
35461,"The next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of"
35461,"the Church at Rome to make no temporal prince but the Pope of Rome"
35461,"himself emperor in effect.  He was already pontifex maximus; for all"
35461,"practical purposes he held the decaying city; if he had no armies he"
35461,"had at least a vast propaganda organization in his priests throughout"
35461,"the whole Latin world; if he had little power over men’s bodies he held"
35461,"the keys of heaven and hell in their imaginations and could exercise"
35461,"much influence upon their souls.  So throughout the middle ages while"
35461,"one prince manœuvred against another first for equality, then for"
35461,"ascendancy, and at last for the supreme prize, the Pope of Rome,"
35461,"sometimes boldly, sometimes craftily, sometimes feebly—for the Popes"
35461,"were a succession of oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was not"
35461,"more than two years—manœuvred for the submission of all the princes to"
35461,"himself as the ultimate overlord of Christendom."
35461,""
35461,"But these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor against"
35461,"Pope do not by any means exhaust the factors of the European confusion."
35461," There was still an Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and"
35461,"claiming the allegiance of all Europe.  When Charlemagne sought to"
35461,"revive the empire, it was merely the Latin end of the empire he"
35461,"revived.  It was natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire"
35461,"and Greek Empire should develop very readily.  And still more readily"
35461,"did the rivalry of Greek-speaking Christianity and the newer"
35461,"Latin-speaking version develop.  The Pope of Rome claimed to be the"
35461,"successor of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ, and the"
35461,"head of the Christian community everywhere.  Neither the emperor nor"
35461,"the patriarch in Constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this"
35461,"claim.  A dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy"
35461,"Trinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a final rupture in"
35461,"1054.  The Latin Church and the Greek Church became and remained"

35461,"In those centuries a simple Christian faith was real and widespread"
35461,"over great areas of Europe.  Rome itself had passed through some dark"
35461,"and discreditable phases; few writers can be found to excuse the lives"
35461,"of Popes John XI and John XII in the tenth century; they were"
35461,"abominable creatures; but the heart and body of Latin Christendom had"
35461,"remained earnest and simple; the generality of the common priests and"
35461,"monks and nuns had lived exemplary and faithful lives.  Upon the wealth"
35461,"of confidence such lives created rested the power of the church.  Among"
35461,"the great Popes of the past had been Gregory the Great, Gregory I"
35461,"(590-604) and Leo III (795-816) who invited Charlemagne to be Cæsar and"
35461,"crowned him in spite of himself.  Towards the close of the eleventh"
35461,"century there arose a great clerical statesman, Hildebrand, who ended"
35461,"his life as Pope Gregory VII (1073- 1085).  Next but one after him came"
35461,"Urban II (1087-1099), the Pope of the First Crusade.  These two were"
35461,"the founders of this period of papal greatness during which the Popes"
35461,"lorded it over the Emperors.  From Bulgaria to Ireland and from Norway"
35461,"to Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme.  Gregory VII obliged the"
35461,"Emperor Henry IV to come in penitence to him at Canossa and to await"
35461,"forgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard of the castle,"
35461,"clad in sackcloth and barefooted to the snow.  In 1176 at Venice the"
35461,"Emperor Frederick (Frederick Barbarossa), knelt to Pope Alexander III"
35461,"and swore fealty to him."

35461,"The great power of the church in the beginning of the eleventh century"
35461,"lay in the wills and consciences of men.  It failed to retain the moral"
35461,"prestige on which its power was based.  In the opening decades of the"
35461,"fourteenth century it was discovered that the power of the Pope had"
35461,"evaporated. What was it that destroyed the naive confidence of the"
35461,"common people of Christendom in the church so that they would no longer"
35461,"rally to its appeal and serve its purposes?"
35461,""
35461,"The first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by the"
35461,"church.  The church never died, and there was a frequent disposition on"
35461,"the part of dying childless people to leave lands to the church. "
35461,"Penitent sinners were exhorted to do so.  Accordingly in many European"
35461,"countries as much as a fourth of the land became church property.  The"
35461,"appetite for property grows with what it feeds upon.  Already in the"
35461,"thirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the priests were"
35461,"not good men, that they were always hunting for money and legacies."
35461,""
35461,"The kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very"
35461,"greatly.  In the place of feudal lords capable of military support,"
35461,"they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns.  And these"
35461,"lands were really under foreign dominion.  Even before the time of Pope"
35461,"Gregory VII there had been a struggle between the princes and the"
35461,"papacy over the question of “investitures,” the question that is of who"
35461,"should appoint the bishops.  If that power rested with the Pope and not"
35461,"the King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of"
35461,"his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions.  For also the"
35461,"clergy claimed exemption from taxation.  They paid their taxes to Rome."
35461," And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax"
35461,"of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes"
35461,"he paid his prince."
35461,""
35461,"The history of nearly every country in Latin Christendom tells of the"
35461,"same phase in the eleventh century, a phase of struggle between monarch"
35461,"and Pope on the issue of investitures and generally it tells of a"
35461,"victory for the Pope.  He claimed to be able to excommunicate the"
35461,"prince, to absolve his subjects from their allegiance to him, to"
35461,"recognize a successor.  He claimed to be able to put a nation under an"
35461,"interdict, and then nearly all priestly functions ceased except the"
35461,"sacraments of baptism, confirmation and penance; the priests could"
35461,"neither hold the ordinary services, marry people, nor bury the dead. "
35461,"With these two weapons it was possible for the twelfth century Popes to"
35461,"curb the most recalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive"
35461,"peoples.  These were enormous powers, and enormous powers are only to"
35461,"be used on extraordinary occasions.  The Popes used them at last with a"
35461,"frequency that staled their effect.  Within thirty years at the end of"
35461,"the twelfth century we find Scotland, France and England in turn under"
35461,"an interdict.  And also the Popes could not resist the temptation to"
35461,"preach crusades against offending princes—until the crusading spirit"
35461,"was extinct."
35461,""
35461,"It is possible that if the Church of Rome had struggled simply against"
35461,"the princes and had had a care to keep its hold upon the general mind,"
35461,"it might have achieved a permanent dominion over all Christendom.  But"
35461,"the high claims of the Pope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct"
35461,"of the clergy.  Before the eleventh century the Roman priests could"
35461,"marry; they had close ties with the people among whom they lived; they"
35461,"were indeed a part of the people.  Gregory VII made them celibates; he"
35461,"cut the priests off from too great an intimacy with the laymen in order"
35461,"to bind them more closely to Rome, but indeed he opened a fissure"
35461,"between the church and the commonalty.  The church had its own law"
35461,"courts. Cases involving not merely priests but monks, students,"
35461,"crusaders, widows, orphans and the helpless were reserved for the"
35461,"clerical courts, and so were all matters relating to wills, marriages"
35461,"and oaths and all cases of sorcery, heresy and blasphemy.  Whenever the"
35461,"layman found himself in conflict with the priest he had to go to a"
35461,"clerical court.  The obligations of peace and war fell upon his"
35461,"shoulders alone and left the priest free.  It is no great wonder that"
35461,"jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the Christian world."
35461,""
35461,"Never did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the consciences of"
35461,"common men.  It fought against religious enthusiasm, which should have"
35461,"been its ally, and it forced doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and"
35461,"aberrant opinion. When the church interfered in matters of morality it"
35461,"had the common man with it, but not when it interfered in matters of"
35461,"doctrine.  When in the south of France Waldo taught a return to the"
35461,"simplicity of Jesus in faith and life, Innocent III preached a crusade"
35461,"against the Waldenses, Waldo’s followers, and permitted them to be"
35461,"suppressed with fire, sword, rape and the most abominable cruelties. "
35461,"When again St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) taught the imitation of"
35461,"Christ and a life of poverty and service, his followers, the"
35461,"Franciscans, were persecuted, scourged, imprisoned and dispersed.  In"
35461,"1318 four of them were burnt alive at Marseilles.  On the other hand"
35461,"the fiercely orthodox order of the Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic"
35461,"(1170-1221) was strongly supported by Innocent III, who with its"
35461,"assistance set up an organization, the Inquisition, for the hunting of"
35461,"heresy and the affliction of free thought."
35461,""
35461,"So it was that the church by excessive claims, by unrighteous"
35461,"privileges, and by an irrational intolerance destroyed that free faith"
35461,"of the common man which was the final source of all its power.  The"
35461,"story of its decline tells of no adequate foemen from without but"

35461,"Frederick was the son of the Emperor Henry VI and his mother was the"
35461,"daughter of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily.  He inherited this"
35461,"kingdom in 1198 when he was a child of four years.  Innocent III had"
35461,"been made his guardian.  Sicily in those days had been but recently"
35461,"conquered by the Normans; the Court was half oriental and full of"
35461,"highly educated Arabs; and some of these were associated in the"
35461,"education of the young king.  No doubt they were at some pains to make"
35461,"their point of view clear to him.  He got a Moslem view of Christianity"
35461,"as well as a Christian view of Islam, and the unhappy result of this"
35461,"double system of instruction was a view, exceptional in that age of"

35461,"gentlemen, both of sceptical opinions, exchanged congenial views, made"
35461,"a commercial convention to their mutual advantage, and agreed to"

35461,"secular coronation as King of Jerusalem, taking the crown from the"
35461,"altar with his own hand—for all the clergy were bound to shun him.  He"
35461,"then returned to Italy, chased the papal armies which had invaded his"
35461,"dominions back to their own territories, and obliged the Pope to grant"
35461,"him absolution from his excommunication.  So a prince might treat the"

35461,"was luxurious in his way of living, and fond of beautiful things.  He"
35461,"is described as licentious.  But it is clear that he was a man of very"
35461,"effectual curiosity and inquiry.  He gathered Jewish and Moslem as well"
35461,"as Christian philosophers at his court, and he did much to irrigate the"
35461,"Italian mind with Saracenic influences.  Through him the Arabic"
35461,"numerals and algebra were introduced to Christian students, and among"

35461,"portions of Aristotle and the commentaries thereon of the great Arab"
35461,"philosopher Averroes (of Cordoba).  In 1224 Frederick founded the"

35461,"In 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope.  He was an Italian, hostile to the"
35461,"French, and full of a sense of the great traditions and mission of"
35461,"Rome.  For a time he carried things with a high hand.  In 1300 he held"
35461,"a jubilee, and a vast multitude of pilgrims assembled in Rome.  “So"
35461,"great was the influx of money into the papal treasury, that two"
35461,"assistants were kept busy with the rakes collecting the offerings that"
35461,"were deposited at the tomb of St. Peter.” [1] But this festival was a"
35461,"delusive triumph.  Boniface came into conflict with the French King in"
35461,"1302, and in 1303, as he was about to pronounce sentence of"
35461,"excommunication against that monarch, he was surprised and arrested in"
35461,"his own ancestral palace at Anagni, by Guillaume de Nogaret.  This"
35461,"agent from the French King forced an entrance into the palace, made his"
35461,"way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope—he was lying in bed with a"
35461,"cross in his hands—and heaped threats and insults upon him.  The Pope"
35461,"was liberated a day or so later by the townspeople, and returned to"
35461,"Rome; but there he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the"
35461,"Orsini family, and in a few weeks’ time the shocked and disillusioned"

35461,"rough treatment of the head of Christendom was acting with the full"
35461,"approval of his people; he had summoned a council of the Three Estates"
35461,"of France (lords, church and commons) and gained their consent before"

35461,"court in the town of Avignon, which then belonged not to France but to"
35461,"the papal See, though embedded in French territory, and there his"
35461,"successors remained until 1377, when Pope Gregory XI returned to the"
35461,"Vatican palace in Rome.  But Gregory XI did not take the sympathies of"
35461,"the whole church with him.  Many of the cardinals were of French origin"
35461,"and their habits and associations were rooted deep at Avignon.  When in"
35461,"1378 Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, these"
35461,"dissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and elected"
35461,"another Pope, the anti-Pope, Clement VII.  This split is called the"
35461,"Great Schism.  The Popes remained in Rome, and all the anti-French"
35461,"powers, the Emperor, the King of England, Hungary, Poland and the North"
35461,"of Europe were loyal to them. The anti-Popes, on the other hand,"
35461,"continued in Avignon, and were supported by the King of France, his"
35461,"ally the King of Scotland, Spain, Portugal and various German princes. "
35461,"Each Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival"
35461,"(1378-1417)."

35461,"Is it any wonder that presently all over Europe people began to think"
35461,"for themselves in matters of religion?"

35461,"The beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which we have"
35461,"noted in the preceding chapters, were but two among many of the new"
35461,"forces that were arising in Christendom, either to hold or shatter the"
35461,"church as its own wisdom might decide. Those two orders the church did"
35461,"assimilate and use, though with a little violence in the case of the"
35461,"former.  But other forces were more frankly disobedient and critical. "
35461,"A century and a half later came Wycliffe (1320-1384). He was a learned"
35461,"Doctor at Oxford.  Quite late in his life he began a series of"
35461,"outspoken criticisms of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom"
35461,"of the church.  He organized a number of poor priests, the Wycliffites,"
35461,"to spread his ideas throughout England; and in order that people should"
35461,"judge between the church and himself, he translated the Bible into"
35461,"English.  He was a more learned and far abler man than either St."
35461,"Francis or St. Dominic.  He had supporters in high places and a great"
35461,"following among the people; and though Rome raged against him, and"
35461,"ordered his imprisonment, he died a free man.  But the black and"
35461,"ancient spirit that was leading the Catholic Church to its destruction"
35461,"would not let his bones rest in the grave.  By a decree of the Council"
35461,"of Constance in 1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt,"
35461,"an order which was carried out at the command of Pope Martin V by"

35461,"China rose suddenly to prominence in the world’s affairs, and achieved"
35461,"such a series of conquests as has no parallel in history. These were"
35461,"the Mongols. At the opening of the thirteenth century they were a horde"
35461,"of nomadic horsemen, living very much as their predecessors, the Huns,"
35461,"had done, subsisting chiefly upon meat and mare’s milk and living in"
35461,"tents of skin. They had shaken themselves free from Chinese dominion,"
35461,"and brought a number of other Turkish tribes into a military"
35461,"confederacy. Their central camp was at Karakorum in Mongolia."

35461,"At this time China was in a state of division.  The great dynasty of"
35461,"Tang had passed into decay by the tenth century, and after a phase of"

35461,"north with Pekin as its capital and that of Sung in the south with a"
35461,"capital at Nankin, and Hsia in the centre, remain.  In 1214 Jengis"

35461,"an altogether amazing march.  Kieff was destroyed in 1240, and nearly"

35461,"Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria. The Mongols displayed a bitter"
35461,"animosity to Islam at this time, and not only massacred the population"

35461,"immemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly"

35461,"Throughout the twelfth century there were many signs that the European"
35461,"intelligence was recovering courage and leisure, and preparing to take"
35461,"up again the intellectual enterprises of the first Greek scientific"
35461,"enquiries and such speculations as those of the Italian Lucretius. The"
35461,"causes of this revival were many and complex. The suppression of"
35461,"private war, the higher standards of comfort and security that followed"
35461,"the crusades, and the stimulation of men’s minds by the experiences of"
35461,"these expeditions were no doubt necessary preliminary conditions. Trade"
35461,"was reviving; cities were recovering ease and safety; the standard of"
35461,"education was arising in the church and spreading among laymen. The"

35461,"travellers, and where men trade and travel they talk and think. The"
35461,"polemics of the Popes and princes, the conspicuous savagery and"
35461,"wickedness of the persecution of heretics, were exciting men to doubt"
35461,"the authority of the church and question and discuss fundamental"

35461,"As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun"

35461,"took up again and thrashed out a series of questions upon the value and"
35461,"meaning of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear thinking in"

35461,"name deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of"

35461,"His writings are one long tirade against ignorance.  He told his age it"

35461,"the fourteenth century did the manufacture reach Germany, and not until"
35461,"the end of that century was it abundant and cheap enough for the"
35461,"printing of books to be a practicable business proposition.  Thereupon"
35461,"printing followed naturally and necessarily, for printing is the most"
35461,"obvious of inventions, and the intellectual life of the world entered"
35461,"upon a new and far more vigorous phase.  It ceased to be a little"
35461,"trickle from mind to mind; it became a broad flood, in which thousands"
35461,"and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated."
35461,""
35461,"One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance"
35461,"of an abundance of Bibles in the world.  Another was a cheapening of"
35461,"school-books.  The knowledge of reading spread swiftly.  There was not"
35461,"only a great increase of books in the world, but the books that were"
35461,"now made were plainer to read and so easier to understand.  Instead of"
35461,"toiling at a crabbed text arid then thinking over its significance,"
35461,"readers now could think unimpeded as they read.  With this increase in"
35461,"the facility of reading, the reading public grew. The book ceased to be"
35461,"a highly decorated toy or a scholar’s mystery.  People began to write"
35461,"books to be read as well as looked at by ordinary people.  They wrote"
35461,"in the ordinary language and not in Latin.  With the fourteenth century"
35461,"the real history of the European literature begins."

35461,"So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the"
35461,"European revival.  Let us turn now to the influence of the Mongol"
35461,"conquests.  They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe"
35461,"enormously.  For a time under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western"
35461,"Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads were temporarily"
35461,"open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of"
35461,"Karakorum.  The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the"
35461,"religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were"
35461,"entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to"
35461,"Christianity.  Their only religion so far had been Shumanism, a"
35461,"primitive paganism.  Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India,"
35461,"Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian"
35461,"merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian"
35461,"astronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court.  We hear too much"
35461,"in history of the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and not"
35461,"enough of their curiosity and desire for learning.  Not perhaps as an"
35461,"originative people, but as transmitters of knowledge and method their"
35461,"influence upon the world’s history has been very great.  And everything"
35461,"one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or"
35461,"Kublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as"
35461,"understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but"
35461,"egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political"
35461,"ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne."

35461,"book.  He went to China about 1272 with his father and uncle, who had"
35461,"already once made the journey. The Great Khan had been deeply impressed"
35461,"by the elder Polos; they were the first men of the “Latin” peoples he"
35461,"had seen; and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers and learned"
35461,"men who could explain Christianity to him, and for various other"

35461,"of the Turks Constantinople turned an unfriendly face upon Genoese"
35461,"trade.  The long forgotten discovery that the world was round had"
35461,"gradually resumed its sway over men’s minds.  The idea of going"
35461,"westward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one.  It was"
35461,"encouraged by two things.  The mariner’s compass had now been invented"
35461,"and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars"
35461,"to determine the direction in which they were sailing, and the Normans,"
35461,"Catalonians and Genoese and Portuguese had already pushed out into the"

35461,"ocean in three small ships.  After a voyage of two months and nine days"
35461,"he came to a land which he believed to be India, but which was really a"
35461,"new continent, whose distinct existence the old world had never"

35461,""
35461,"From the very outset of his reign he was faced by the situation created"
35461,"by Luther’s agitations in Germany. The Emperor had one reason for"
35461,"siding with the reformers in the opposition of the Pope to his"
35461,"election.  But he had been brought up in Spain, that most Catholic of"
35461,"countries, and he decided against Luther.  So he came into conflict"
35461,"with the Protestant princes and particularly the Elector of Saxony. He"
35461,"found himself in the presence of an opening rift that was to split the"
35461,"outworn fabric of Christendom into two contending camps.  His attempts"
35461,"to close that rift were strenuous and honest and ineffective.  There"
35461,"was an extensive peasant revolt in Germany which interwove with the"
35461,"general political and religious disturbance.  And these internal"
35461,"troubles were complicated by attacks upon the Empire from east and west"
35461,"alike.  On the west of Charles was his spirited rival, Francis I; to"
35461,"the east was the ever advancing Turk, who was now in Hungary, in"
35461,"alliance with Francis and clamouring for certain arrears of tribute"
35461,"from the Austrian dominions.  Charles had the money and army of Spain"
35461,"at his disposal, but it was extremely difficult to get any effective"
35461,"support in money from Germany.  His social and political troubles were"
35461,"complicated by financial distresses.  He was forced to ruinous"
35461,"borrowing."

35461,"On the whole, Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful"
35461,"against Francis I and the Turk.  Their chief battlefield was North"
35461,"Italy; the generalship was dull on both sides; their advances and"
35461,"retreats depended mainly on the arrival of reinforcements.  The German"
35461,"army invaded France, failed to take Marseilles, fell back into Italy,"
35461,"lost Milan, and was besieged in Pavia.  Francis I made a long and"
35461,"unsuccessful siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh German forces,"
35461,"defeated, wounded and taken prisoner.  But thereupon the Pope and Henry"
35461,"VIII, still haunted by the fear of his attaining excessive power,"
35461,"turned against Charles.  The German troops in Milan, under the"
35461,"Constable of Bourbon, being unpaid, forced rather than followed their"
35461,"commander into a raid upon Rome.  They stormed the city and pillaged it"
35461,"(1527).  The Pope took refuge in the Castle of St. Angelo while the"
35461,"looting and slaughter went on.  He bought off the German troops at last"
35461,"by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats.  Ten years of such"
35461,"confused fighting impoverished all Europe.  At last the Emperor found"
35461,"himself triumphant in Italy.  In 1530, he was crowned by the Pope—he"
35461,"was the last German Emperor to be so crowned—at Bologna."
35461,""
35461,"Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary. They had"
35461,"defeated and killed the king of Hungary in 1526, they held Buda-Pesth,"
35461,"and in 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent very nearly took Vienna.  The"
35461,"Emperor was greatly concerned by these advances, and did his utmost to"
35461,"drive back the Turks, but he found the greatest difficulty in getting"
35461,"the German princes to unite even with this formidable enemy upon their"
35461,"very borders.  Francis I remained implacable for a time, and there was"
35461,"a new French war; but in 1538 Charles won his rival over to a more"
35461,"friendly attitude after ravaging the south of France.  Francis and"
35461,"Charles then formed an alliance against the Turk.  But the Protestant"
35461,"princes, the German princes who were resolved to break away from Rome,"
35461,"had formed a league, the Schmalkaldic League, against the Emperor, and"
35461,"in the place of a great campaign to recover Hungary for Christendom"
35461,"Charles had to turn his mind to the gathering internal struggle in"
35461,"Germany.  Of that struggle he saw only the opening war.  It was a"
35461,"struggle, a sanguinary irrational bickering of princes, for ascendancy,"
35461,"now flaming into war and destruction, now sinking back to intrigues and"
35461,"diplomacies; it was a snake’s sack of princely policies that was to go"
35461,"on writhing incurably right into the nineteenth century and to waste"
35461,"and desolate Central Europe again and again."
35461,""
35461,"The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in"
35461,"these gathering troubles.  He was for his time and station an"
35461,"exceptionally worthy man, and he seems to have taken the religious"
35461,"dissensions that were tearing Europe into warring fragments as genuine"
35461,"theological differences.  He gathered diets and councils in futile"
35461,"attempts at reconciliation.  Formulæ and confessions were tried over. "
35461,"The student of German history must struggle with the details of the"
35461,"Religious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at the Diet of Ratisbon,"
35461,"the Interim of Augsburg, and the like.  Here we do but mention them as"
35461,"details in the worried life of this culminating Emperor.  As a matter"
35461,"of fact, hardly one of the multifarious princes and rulers in Europe"
35461,"seems to have been acting in good faith.  The widespread religious"
35461,"trouble of the world, the desire of the common people for truth and"
35461,"social righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time, all those"
35461,"things were merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy. "
35461,"Henry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a book against"
35461,"heresy, and who had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of"
35461,"“Defender of the Faith,” being anxious to divorce his first wife in"
35461,"favour of a young lady named Anne Boleyn, and wishing also to loot the"
35461,"vast wealth of the church in England, joined the company of Protestant"
35461,"princes in 1530. Sweden, Denmark and Norway had already gone over to"
35461,"the Protestant side."
35461,""
35461,"The German religious war began in 1546, a few months after the death of"
35461,"Martin Luther.  We need not trouble about the incidents of the"
35461,"campaign.  The Protestant Saxon army was badly beaten at Lochau.  By"
35461,"something very like a breach of faith Philip of Hesse, the Emperor’s"
35461,"chief remaining antagonist, was caught and imprisoned, and the Turks"
35461,"were bought off by the promise of an annual tribute.  In 1547, to the"
35461,"great relief of the Emperor, Francis I died.  So by 1547 Charles got to"
35461,"a kind of settlement, and made his last efforts to effect peace where"
35461,"there was no peace.  In 1552 all Germany was at war again, only a"
35461,"precipitate flight from Innsbruck saved Charles from capture, and in"
35461,"1552, with the treaty of Passau, came another unstable equilibrium ...."
35461,""
35461,"Such is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for thirty-two"
35461,"years.  It is interesting to note how entirely the European mind was"
35461,"concentrated upon the struggle for European ascendancy.  Neither Turks,"
35461,"French, English nor Germans had yet discovered any political interest"
35461,"in the great continent of America, nor any significance in the new sea"
35461,"routes to Asia.  Great things were happening in America; Cortez with a"
35461,"mere handful of men had conquered the great Neolithic empire of Mexico"
35461,"for Spain, Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus of Panama (1530) and"
35461,"subjugated another wonder-land, Peru.  But as yet these events meant no"
35461,"more to Europe than a useful and stimulating influx of silver to the"
35461,"Spanish treasury."
35461,""
35461,"It was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to display his"
35461,"distinctive originality of mind.  He was now entirely bored and"
35461,"disillusioned by his imperial greatness. A sense of the intolerable"
35461,"futility of these European rivalries came upon him.  He had never been"
35461,"of a very sound constitution, he was naturally indolent and he was"
35461,"suffering greatly from gout.  He abdicated.  He made over all his"
35461,"sovereign rights in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, and Spain and the"
35461,"Netherlands he resigned to his son Philip. Then in a sort of"
35461,"magnificent dudgeon he retired to a monastery at Yuste, among the oak"
35461,"and chestnut forests in the hills to the north of the Tagus valley. "
35461,"There he died in 1558."
35461,""
35461,"Much has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement, this"
35461,"renunciation of the world by this tired majestic Titan, world-weary,"
35461,"seeking in an austere solitude his peace with God.  But his retreat was"
35461,"neither solitary nor austere; he had with him nearly a hundred and"
35461,"fifty attendants: his establishment had all the splendour and"
35461,"indulgences without the fatigues or a court, and Philip II was a"
35461,"dutiful son to whom his father’s advice was a command."

35461,"And if Charles had lost his living interest in the administration of"
35461,"European affairs, there were other motives of a more immediate sort to"
35461,"stir him.  Says Prescott: “In the almost daily correspondence between"
35461,"Quixada, or Gaztelu, and the Secretary of State at Valladolid, there is"
35461,"scarcely a letter that does not turn more or less on the Emperor’s"
35461,"eating or his illness.  The one seems naturally to follow, like a"
35461,"running commentary, on the other.  It is rare that such topics have"
35461,"formed the burden of communications with the department of state.  It"
35461,"must have been no easy matter for the secretary to preserve his gravity"
35461,"in the perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy were so"
35461,"strangely mixed together.  The courier from Valladolid to Lisbon was"
35461,"ordered to make a detour, so as to take Jarandilla in his route, and"
35461,"bring supplies to the royal table.  On Thursdays he was to bring fish"
35461,"to serve for the jour maigre that was to follow.  The trout in the"
35461,"neighbourhood Charles thought too small, so others of a larger size"
35461,"were to be sent from Valladolid.  Fish of every kind was to his taste,"
35461,"as, indeed, was anything that in its nature or habits at all approached"
35461,"to fish.  Eels, frogs, oysters, occupied an important place in the"
35461,"royal bill of fare.  Potted fish, especially anchovies, found great"
35461,"favour with him; and he regretted that he had not brought a better"
35461,"supply of these from the Low Countries.  On an eel-pasty he"
35461,"particularly doted.” ... [1]"
35461,""
35461,"In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting him a"
35461,"dispensation from fasting, and allowing him to break his fast early in"
35461,"the morning even when he was to take the sacrament."
35461,""
35461,"Eating and doctoring! it was a return to elemental things. He had never"
35461,"acquired the habit of reading, but he would be read aloud to at meals"
35461,"after the fashion of Charlemagne, and would make what one narrator"
35461,"describes as a “sweet and heavenly commentary.”  He also amused himself"
35461,"with mechanical toys, by listening to music or sermons, and by"
35461,"attending to the imperial business that still came drifting in to him. "
35461,"The death of the Empress, to whom he was greatly attached, had turned"
35461,"his mind towards religion, which in his case took a punctilious and"
35461,"ceremonial form; every Friday in Lent he scourged himself with the rest"
35461,"of the monks with such good will as to draw blood.  These exercises and"
35461,"the gout released a bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been"
35461,"restrained by considerations of policy.  The appearance of Protestant"
35461,"teaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury.  “Tell the"
35461,"grand inquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts, and to"
35461,"lay the axe at the root of the evil before it spreads further.” . .. He"
35461,"expressed a doubt whether it would not be well, in so black an affair,"
35461,"to dispense with the ordinary course of justice, and to show no mercy;"
35461,"“lest the criminal, if pardoned, should have the opportunity of"
35461,"repeating his crime.”  He recommended, as an example, his own mode or"
35461,"proceeding in the Netherlands, “where all who remained obstinate in"
35461,"their errors were burned alive, and those who were admitted to"
35461,"penitence were beheaded.”"
35461,""
35461,"And almost symbolical of his place and role in history was his"
35461,"preoccupation with funerals.  He seems to have had an intuition that"
35461,"something great was dead in Europe and sorely needed burial, that there"
35461,"was a need to write Finis, overdue.  He not only attended every actual"
35461,"funeral that was celebrated at Yuste, but he had services conducted for"
35461,"the absent dead, he held a funeral service in memory of his wife on the"
35461,"anniversary of her death, and finally he celebrated his own obsequies."
35461,""
35461,"“The chapel was hung with black, and the blaze of hundreds of"
35461,"wax-lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness.  The"
35461,"brethren in their conventual dress, and all the Emperor’s household"
35461,"clad in deep mourning, gathered round a huge catafalque, shrouded also"
35461,"in black, which had been raised in the centre of the chapel.  The"
35461,"service for the burial of the dead was then performed; and, amidst the"
35461,"dismal wail of the monks, the prayers ascended for the departed spirit,"
35461,"that it might be received into the mansions of the blessed.  The"
35461,"sorrowful attendants were melted to tears, as the image of their"
35461,"master’s death was presented to their minds—or they were touched, it"
35461,"may be, with compassion by this pitiable display of weakness.  Charles,"
35461,"muffled in a dark mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his hand,"
35461,"mingled with his household, the spectator of his own obsequies; and the"
35461,"doleful ceremony was concluded by his placing the taper in the hands of"
35461,"the priest, in sign of his surrendering up his soul to the Almighty.”"
35461,""
35461,"Within two months of this masquerade he was dead.  And the brief"
35461,"greatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him.  His realm was"
35461,"already divided between his brother and his son. The Holy Roman Empire"
35461,"struggled on indeed to the days of Napoleon I but as an invalid and"

35461,"The Latin Church was broken, the Holy Roman Empire was in extreme"

35461,"onward is a story of peoples feeling their way darkly to some new"
35461,"method of government, better adapted to the new conditions that were"
35461,"arising. In the Ancient World, over long periods of time, there had"
35461,"been changes of dynasty and even changes of ruling race and language,"
35461,"but the form of government through monarch and temple remained fairly"
35461,"stable, and still more stable was the ordinary way of living. In this"
35461,"modern Europe since the sixteenth century the dynastic changes are"
35461,"unimportant, and the interest of history lies in the wide and"
35461,"increasing variety of experiments in political and social organization."
35461,""
35461,"The political history of the world from the sixteenth century onward"
35461,"was, we have said, an effort, a largely unconscious effort, of mankind"
35461,"to adapt its political and social methods to certain new conditions"
35461,"that had now arisen.  The effort to adapt was complicated by the fad"
35461,"that the conditions themselves were changing with a steadily increasing"
35461,"rapidity. The adaptation, mainly unconscious and almost always"
35461,"unwilling (for man in general hates voluntary change), has lagged more"
35461,"and more behind the alterations in conditions. From the sixteenth"
35461,"century onward the history of mankind is a story of political and"
35461,"social institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less"
35461,"comfortable and more vexatious, and of the slow reluctant realization"
35461,"of the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole"
35461,"scheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to"
35461,"all the former experiences of life."
35461,""
35461,"What are these changes in the conditions of human life that have"
35461,"disorganized that balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader, with"
35461,"periodic refreshment by barbaric conquest, that has held human affairs"
35461,"in the Old World in a sort of working rhythm for more than a hundred"
35461,"centuries?"
35461,""
35461,"They are manifold and various, for human affairs are multitudinously"
35461,"complex; but the main changes seem all to turn upon one cause, namely"
35461,"the growth and extension of a knowledge of the nature of things,"
35461,"beginning first of all in small groups of intelligent people and"
35461,"spreading at first slowly, and in the last five hundred years very"
35461,"rapidly, to larger and larger proportions of the general population."
35461,""
35461,"But there has also been a great change in human conditions due to a"
35461,"change in the spirit of human life.  This change has gone on side by"
35461,"side with the increase and extension of knowledge, and is subtly"
35461,"connected with it.  There has been an increasing disposition to treat a"
35461,"life based on the common and more elementary desires and gratifications"
35461,"as unsatisfactory, and to seek relationship with and service and"
35461,"participation in a larger life.  This is the common characteristic of"
35461,"all the great religions that have spread throughout the world in the"
35461,"last twenty odd centuries, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam alike. "
35461,"They have had to do with the spirit of man in a way that the older"
35461,"religions did not have to do.  They are forces quite different in their"
35461,"nature and effect from the old fetishistic blood-sacrifice religions of"
35461,"priest and temple that they have in part modified and in part replaced."
35461," They have gradually evolved a self-respect in the individual and a"
35461,"sense of participation and responsibility in the common concerns of"
35461,"mankind that did not exist among the populations of the earlier"
35461,"civilizations."
35461,""
35461,"The first considerable change in the conditions of political and social"
35461,"life was the simplification and extended use of writing in the ancient"
35461,"civilizations which made larger empires and wider political"
35461,"understandings practicable and inevitable.  The next movement forward"
35461,"came with the introduction of the horse, and later on of the camel as a"
35461,"means of transport, the use of wheeled vehicles, the extension of roads"
35461,"and the increased military efficiency due to the discovery of"
35461,"terrestrial iron.  Then followed the profound economic disturbances due"
35461,"to the device of coined money and the change in the nature of debt,"
35461,"proprietorship and trade due to this convenient but dangerous"
35461,"convention. The empires grew in size and range, and men’s ideas grew"
35461,"likewise to correspond with these things.  Came the disappearance of"
35461,"local gods, the age of theocrasia, and the teaching of the great world"
35461,"religions.  Came also the beginnings of reasoned and recorded history"
35461,"and geography, the first realization by man of his profound ignorance,"
35461,"and the first systematic search for knowledge."
35461,""
35461,"For a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in Greece"
35461,"and Alexandria was interrupted.  The raids of the Teutonic barbarians,"
35461,"the westward drive of the Mongolian peoples, convulsive religious"
35461,"reconstruction and great pestilences put enormous strains upon"
35461,"political and social order.  When civilization emerged again from this"
35461,"phase of conflict and confusion, slavery was no longer the basis of"
35461,"economic life; and the first paper-mills were preparing a new medium"
35461,"for collective information and co-operation in printed matter. "
35461,"Gradually at this point and that, the search for knowledge, the"
35461,"systematic scientific process, was resumed."
35461,""
35461,"And now from the sixteenth century onward, as an inevitable by-product"
35461,"of systematic thought, appeared a steadily increasing series of"
35461,"inventions and devices affecting the intercommunication and interaction"
35461,"of men with one another. They all tended towards wider range of action,"
35461,"greater mutual benefits or injuries, and increased co-operation, and"
35461,"they came faster and faster.  Men’s minds had not been prepared for"
35461,"anything of the sort, and until the great catastrophes at the beginning"
35461,"of the twentieth century quickened men’s minds, the historian has very"
35461,"little to tell of any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new"
35461,"conditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating. The history"
35461,"of mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an"
35461,"imprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison"
35461,"that restrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking but"
35461,"incorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and"
35461,"incongruous dreams, than like that of a man consciously awake to danger"
35461,"and opportunity."
35461,""
35461,"Since history is the story not of individual lives but of communities,"
35461,"it is inevitable that the inventions that figure most in the historical"
35461,"record are inventions affecting communications.  In the sixteenth"
35461,"century the chief new things that we have to note are the appearance of"
35461,"printed paper and the sea-worthy, ocean-going sailing ship using the"
35461,"new device of the mariner’s compass.  The former cheapened, spread, and"
35461,"revolutionized teaching, public information and discussion, and the"
35461,"fundamental operations of political activity.  The latter made the"
35461,"round world one.  But almost equally important was the increased"
35461,"utilization and improvement of guns and gunpowder which the Mongols had"
35461,"first brought westward in the thirteenth century.  This destroyed the"
35461,"practical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities. "

35461,"Cossacks, who formed a barrier between the feudal agriculture of Poland"
35461,"and Hungary to the west and the Tartar to the east.  The Cossacks were"
35461,"the wild east of Europe, and in many ways not unlike the wild west of"
35461,"the United States in the middle nineteenth century. All who had made"
35461,"Russia too hot to hold them, criminals as well as the persecuted"
35461,"innocent, rebellious serfs, religious secretaries, thieves, vagabonds,"
35461,"murderers, sought asylum in the southern steppes and there made a fresh"
35461,"start and fought for life and freedom against Pole, Russian and Tartar"
35461,"alike. Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also"
35461,"contributed to the Cossack mixture.  Slowly these border folk were"

35461,"of America was peopled mainly from Western European sources, and South"
35461,"Africa and Australia and New Zealand marked down as prospective homes"
35461,"for a European population."

35461,"The motive that had sent Columbus to America and Vasco da Gama to India"
35461,"was the perennial first motive of all sailors since the beginning of"
35461,"things—trade.  But while in the already populous and productive East"
35461,"the trade motive remained dominant, and the European settlements"
35461,"remained trading settlements from which the European inhabitants hoped"
35461,"to return home to spend their money, the Europeans in America, dealing"
35461,"with communities at a very much lower level of productive activity,"
35461,"found a new inducement for persistence in the search for gold and"
35461,"silver.  Particularly did the mines of Spanish America yield silver. "
35461,"The Europeans had to go to America not simply as armed merchants but as"
35461,"prospectors, miners, searchers after natural products, and presently as"
35461,"planters.  In the north they sought furs.  Mines and plantations"
35461,"necessitated settlements.  They obliged people to set up permanent"
35461,"overseas homes.  Finally in some cases, as when the English Puritans"
35461,"went to New England in the early seventeenth 336}century to escape"
35461,"religious persecution, when in the eighteenth Oglethorpe sent people"
35461,"from the English debtors’ prisons to Georgia, and when in the end of"
35461,"the eighteenth the Dutch sent orphans to the Cape of Good Hope, the"
35461,"Europeans frankly crossed the seas to find new homes for good.  In the"
35461,"nineteenth century, and especially after the coming of the steamship,"
35461,"the stream of European emigration to the new empty lands of America and"
35461,"Australia rose for some decades to the scale of a great migration."
35461,""
35461,"So there grew up permanent overseas populations of Europeans, and the"
35461,"European culture was transplanted to much larger areas than those in"
35461,"which it had been developed.  These new communities bringing a"
35461,"ready-made civilization with them to these new lands grew up, as it"
35461,"were, unplanned and unperceived; the statecraft of Europe did not"
35461,"foresee them, and was unprepared with any ideas about their treatment. "
35461,"The politicians and ministers of Europe continued to regard them as"
35461,"essentially expeditionary establishments, sources of revenue,"
35461,"“possessions” and “dependencies,” long after their peoples had"
35461,"developed a keen sense of their separate social life.  And also they"
35461,"continued to treat them as helplessly subject to the mother country"
35461,"long after the population had spread inland out of reach of any"
35461,"effectual punitive operations from the sea."
35461,""
35461,"Because until right into the nineteenth century, it must be remembered,"
35461,"the link of all these overseas empires was the oceangoing sailing ship."
35461," On land the swiftest thing was still the horse, and the cohesion and"
35461,"unity of political systems on land was still limited by the limitations"
35461,"of horse communications."

35461,"Now at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century the"
35461,"northern two-thirds of North America was under the British crown. "
35461,"France had abandoned America.  Except for Brazil, which was Portuguese,"
35461,"and one or two small islands and areas in French, British, Danish and"
35461,"Dutch hands, Florida, Louisiana, California and all America to the"
35461,"south was Spanish.  It was the British colonies south of Maine and Lake"
35461,"Ontario that first demonstrated the inadequacy of the sailing ship to"
35461,"hold overseas populations together in one political system."
35461,""
35461,"These British colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and"
35461,"character.  There were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements as well as"
35461,"British; there were British Catholics in Maryland and British"
35461,"ultra-Protestants in New England, and while the New Englanders farmed"
35461,"their own land and denounced slavery, the British in Virginia and the"
35461,"south were planters employing a swelling multitude of imported negro"
35461,"slaves.  There was no natural common unity in such states.  To get from"
35461,"one to the other might mean a coasting voyage hardly less tedious than"
35461,"the transatlantic crossing.  But the union that diverse origin and"
35461,"natural conditions denied the British Americans was forced upon them by"
35461,"the selfishness and stupidity of the British government in London. "
35461,"They were taxed without any voice in the spending of the taxes; their"
35461,"trade was sacrificed to British interests; the highly profitable slave"
35461,"trade was maintained by the British government in spite of the"
35461,"opposition of the Virginians who—though quite willing to hold and use"
35461,"slaves—feared to be swamped by an ever-growing barbaric black"

35461,"immediate dangers of division.  A Constitution was drawn up and"

35461,"a President holding very considerable powers, and the weak sense of"
35461,"national unity was invigorated by a second war with Britain in 1812. "
35461,"Nevertheless the area covered by the States was so wide and their"

35461,""
35461,"Britain had hardly lost the Thirteen Colonies in America before a"
35461,"profound social and political convulsion at the very heart of Grand"
35461,"Monarchy was to remind Europe still more vividly of the essentially"
35461,"temporary nature of the political arrangements of the world."
35461,""
35461,"We have said that the French monarchy was the most successful of the"
35461,"personal monarchies in Europe.  It was the envy and model of a"
35461,"multitude of competing and minor courts.  But it flourished on a basis"
35461,"of injustice that led to its dramatic collapse.  It was brilliant and"
35461,"aggressive, but it was wasteful of the life and substance of its common"
35461,"people.  The clergy and nobility were protected from taxation by a"
35461,"system of exemption that threw the whole burden of the state upon the"
35461,"middle and lower classes.  The peasants were ground down by taxation;"
35461,"the middle classes were dominated and humiliated by the nobility."
35461,""
35461,"In 1787 this French monarchy found itself bankrupt and obliged to call"
35461,"representatives of the different classes of the realm into consultation"
35461,"upon the perplexities of defective income and excessive expenditure. "
35461,"In 1789 the States General, a gathering of the nobles, clergy and"
35461,"commons, roughly equivalent to the earlier form of the British"
35461,"Parliament, was called together at Versailles.  It had not assembled"
35461,"since 1610.  For all that time France had been an absolute monarchy. "
35461,"Now the people found a means of expressing their long fermenting"
35461,"discontent.  Disputes immediately broke out between the three estates,"
35461,"due to the resolve of the Third Estate, the Commons, to control the"
35461,"Assembly.  The Commons got the better of these disputes and the States"
35461,"General became a National Assembly, clearly resolved to keep the crown"
35461,"in order, as the British Parliament kept the British crown in order. "
35461,"The king (Louis XVI) prepared for a struggle and brought up troops from"
35461,"the provinces.  Whereupon Paris and France revolted."
35461,""
35461,"The collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift.  The grim-looking"
35461,"prison of the Bastille was stormed by the people of Paris, and the"
35461,"insurrection spread rapidly throughout France.  In the east and"
35461,"north-west provinces many chateaux belonging to the nobility were burnt"
35461,"by the peasants, their title-deeds carefully destroyed, and the owners"
35461,"murdered or driven away.  In a month the ancient and decayed system of"
35461,"the aristocratic order had collapsed.  Many of the leading princes and"
35461,"courtiers of the queen’s party fled abroad. A provisional city"
35461,"government was set up in Paris and in most of the other large cities,"
35461,"and a new armed force, the National Guard, a force designed primarily"
35461,"and plainly to resist the forces of the crown, was brought into"
35461,"existence by these municipal bodies.  The National Assembly found"
35461,"itself called upon to create a new political and social system for a"
35461,"new age."
35461,""
35461,"It was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the utmost. "
35461,"It made a great sweep of the chief injustices of the absolutist regime;"
35461,"it abolished tax exemptions, serfdom, aristocratic titles and"
35461,"privileges and sought to establish a constitutional monarchy in Paris. "
35461,"The king abandoned Versailles and its splendours and kept a diminished"
35461,"state in the palace of the Tuileries in Paris."
35461,""
35461,"For two years it seemed that the National Assembly might struggle"
35461,"through to an effective modernized government.  Much of its work was"
35461,"sound and still endures, if much was experimental and had to be undone."
35461," Much was ineffective. There was a clearing up of the penal code;"
35461,"torture, arbitrary imprisonment and persecutions for heresy were"
35461,"abolished.  The ancient provinces of France, Normandy, Burgundy and the"
35461,"like gave place to eighty departments.  Promotion to the highest ranks"
35461,"in the army was laid open to men of every class.  An excellent and"
35461,"simple system of law courts was set up, but its value was much vitiated"
35461,"by having the judges appointed by popular election for short periods of"
35461,"time.  This made the crowd a sort of final court of appeal, and the"
35461,"judges, like the members of the Assembly, were forced to play to the"
35461,"gallery.  And the whole vast property of the church was seized and"
35461,"administered by the state; religious establishments not engaged in"
35461,"education or works of charity were broken up, and the salaries of the"
35461,"clergy made a charge upon the nation.  This in itself was not a bad"
35461,"thing for the lower clergy in France, who were often scandalously"
35461,"underpaid in comparison with the richer dignitaries.  But in addition"
35461,"the choice of priests and bishops was made elective, which struck at"
35461,"the very root idea of the Roman Church, which centred everything upon"
35461,"the Pope, and in which all authority is from above downward. "
35461,"Practically the National Assembly wanted at one blow to make the church"
35461,"in France Protestant, in organization if not in doctrine.  Everywhere"
35461,"there were disputes and conflicts between the state priests created by"
35461,"the National Assembly and the recalcitrant (non-juring) priests who"
35461,"were loyal to Rome."

35461,"In 1791 the experiment of Constitutional monarchy in France was brought"
35461,"to an abrupt end by the action of the king and queen, working in"
35461,"concert with their aristocratic and monarchist friends abroad.  Foreign"
35461,"armies gathered on the Eastern frontier and one night in June the king"
35461,"and queen and their children slipped away from the Tuileries and fled"
35461,"to join the foreigners and the aristocratic exiles.  They were caught"
35461,"at Varennes and brought back to Paris, and an France flamed up into a"
35461,"passion of patriotic republicanism.  A Republic was proclaimed, open"
35461,"war with Austria and Prussia ensued, and the king was tried and"
35461,"executed (January, 1793) on the model already set by England, for"
35461,"treason to his people."
35461,""
35461,"And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people. "
35461,"There arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and the Republic. "
35461,"There was to be an end to compromise at home and abroad; at home"
35461,"royalists and every form of disloyalty were to be stamped out; abroad"
35461,"France was to be the protector and helper of all revolutionaries.  All"
35461,"Europe, all the world, was to become Republican.  The youth of France"
35461,"poured into the Republican armies; a new and wonderful song spread"
35461,"through the land, a song that still warms the blood like wine, the"
35461,"Marseillaise.  Before that chant and the leaping columns of French"
35461,"bayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies"
35461,"rolled back; before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far"
35461,"beyond the utmost achievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on"
35461,"foreign soil. They were in Brussels, they had overrun Savoy, they had"
35461,"raided to Mayence; they had seized the Scheldt from Holland. Then the"
35461,"French Government did an unwise thing.  It had been exasperated by the"
35461,"expulsion of its representative from England upon the execution of"
35461,"Louis, and it declared war against England.  It was an unwise thing to"
35461,"do, because the revolution which had given France a new enthusiastic"
35461,"infantry and a brilliant artillery released from its aristocratic"
35461,"officers and many cramping conditions had destroyed the discipline of"
35461,"the navy, and the English were supreme upon the sea.  And this"
35461,"provocation united all England against France, whereas there had been"
35461,"at first a very considerable liberal movement in Great Britain in"

35461,"frozen in the Texel, surrendered to a handful of cavalry without firing"
35461,"its guns. For some time the French thrust towards Italy was hung up,"
35461,"and it was only in 1796 that a new general, Napoleon Bonaparte, led the"
35461,"ragged and hungry republican armies in triumph across Piedmont to"
35461,"Mantua and Verona.  Says C. F. Atkinson,  [1] “What astonished the"
35461,"Allies most of all was the number and the velocity of the Republicans. "
35461,"These improvised armies had in fact nothing to delay them.  Tents were"

35461,"enormous number of wagons that would have been required, and also"
35461,"unnecessary, for the discomfort that would have caused wholesale"
35461,"desertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of"
35461,"1793- 94.   Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could not be"
35461,"carried in convoys, and the French soon became familiar with ‘living on"

35461,"bivouacs, requisitions and force as against cautious manœuvring, small"
35461,"professional armies, tents and full rations, and chicane. The first"

35461,"the sway of a fanatical leader, Robespierre.  This man is difficult to"

35461,"Republic.  The living spirit of the Republic, it seemed, had sprung"
35461,"from a slaughter of royalists and the execution of the king.  There"
35461,"were insurrections; one in the west, in the district of La Vendée,"
35461,"where the people rose against the conscription and against the"
35461,"dispossession of the orthodox clergy, and were led by noblemen and"
35461,"priests; one in the south, where Lyons and Marseilles had risen and the"

35461,"The Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering"

35461,"had no real grasp of the new forces that were working in Europe.  His"
35461,"utmost political imagination carried him to a belated and tawdry"
35461,"attempt to restore the Western Empire.  He tried to destroy the remains"
35461,"of the old Holy Roman Empire, intending to replace it by a new one"
35461,"centring upon Paris. The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman"
35461,"Emperor and became simply Emperor of Austria.  Napoleon divorced his"

35461,"He became practically monarch of France as First Consul in 1799, and he"

35461,"For some years Napoleon’s reign was a career of victory.  He conquered"

35461,"from the British and his fleets sustained a conclusive defeat inflicted"
35461,"by the British Admiral Nelson at Trafalgar (1805). Spain rose against"
35461,"him in 1808 and a British army under Wellington thrust the French"
35461,"armies slowly northward out of the peninsula.  In 1811 Napoleon came"
35461,"into conflict with the Tsar Alexander I, and in 1812 he invaded Russia"
35461,"with a great conglomerate army of 600,000 men, that was defeated and"
35461,"largely destroyed by the Russians and the Russian winter. Germany rose"
35461,"against him, Sweden turned against him.  The French armies were beaten"

35461,""
35461,""
35461,"Two main causes prevented that period from being a complete social and"
35461,"international peace, and prepared the way for the cycle of wars between"
35461,"1854 and 1871. The first of these was the tendency of the royal courts"
35461,"concerned, towards the restoration of unfair privilege and interference"
35461,"with freedom of thought and writing and teaching. The second was the"
35461,"impossible system of boundaries drawn by the diplomatists of Vienna."
35461,""
35461,"The inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards past"
35461,"conditions was first and most particularly manifest in Spain.  Here"
35461,"even the Inquisition was restored.  Across the Atlantic the Spanish"
35461,"colonies had followed the example of the United States and revolted"
35461,"against the European Great Power System, when Napoleon set his brother"
35461,"Joseph on the Spanish throne in 1810.  The George Washington of South"
35461,"America was General Bolivar.  Spain was unable to suppress this revolt,"
35461,"it dragged on much as the United States War of Independence had dragged"
35461,"on, and at last the suggestion was made by Austria, in accordance with"
35461,"the spirit of the Holy Alliance, that the European monarch should"
35461,"assist Spain in this struggle.  This was opposed by Britain in Europe,"
35461,"but it was the prompt action of President Monroe of the United States"
35461,"in 1823 which conclusively warned off this projected monarchist"
35461,"restoration.  He announced that the United States would regard any"
35461,"extension of the European system in the Western Hemisphere as a hostile"
35461,"act.  Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine, the doctrine that there must be"
35461,"no extension of extra- American government in America, which has kept"
35461,"the Great Power system out of America for nearly a hundred years and"
35461,"permitted the new states of Spanish America to work out their destinies"
35461,"along their own lines."
35461,""
35461,"But if Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least, under"
35461,"the protection of the Concert of Europe, do what it chose in Europe.  A"
35461,"popular insurrection in Spain was crushed by a French army in 1823,"
35461,"with a mandate from a European congress, and simultaneously Austria"
35461,"suppressed a revolution in Naples."
35461,""
35461,"In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X. Charles set"
35461,"himself to destroy the liberty of the press and universities, and to"
35461,"restore absolute government; the sum of a billion francs was voted to"
35461,"compensate the nobles for the chateau burnings and sequestrations of"
35461,"1789.  In 1830 Paris rose against this embodiment of the ancient"
35461,"regime, and replaced him by Louis Philippe, the son of that Philip,"
35461,"Duke of Orleans, who was executed during the Terror.  The other"
35461,"continental monarchies, in face of the open approval of the revolution"
35461,"by Great Britain and a strong liberal ferment in Germany and Austria,"
35461,"did not interfere in this affair.  After all, France was still a"
35461,"monarchy.  This man Louis Philippe (1830-48) remained the"
35461,"constitutional King of France for eighteen years."
35461,""
35461,"Such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of Vienna,"
35461,"which were provoked by the reactionary proceedings of the monarchists. "
35461,"The stresses that arose from the unscientific boundaries planned by the"
35461,"diplomatists at Vienna gathered force more deliberately, but they were"
35461,"even more dangerous to the peace of mankind.  It is extraordinarily"
35461,"inconvenient to administer together the affairs of peoples speaking"
35461,"different languages and so reading different literatures and having"
35461,"different general ideas, especially if those differences are"
35461,"exacerbated by religious disputes. Only some strong mutual interest,"
35461,"such as the common defensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can"
35461,"justify a close linking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths;"
35461,"and even in Switzerland there is the utmost local autonomy. When, as in"
35461,"Macedonia, populations are mixed in a patchwork of villages and"
35461,"districts, the cantonal system is imperatively needed.  But if the"
35461,"reader will look at the map of Europe as the Congress of Vienna drew"
35461,"it, he will see that this gathering seems almost as if it had planned"
35461,"the maximum of local exasperation."

35461,"It destroyed the Dutch Republic, quite needlessly, it lumped together"
35461,"the Protestant Dutch with the French-speaking Catholics of the old"
35461,"Spanish (Austrian) Netherlands, and set up a kingdom of the"
35461,"Netherlands.  It handed over not merely the old republic of Venice, but"
35461,"all of North Italy as far as Milan to the German-speaking Austrians. "
35461,"French-speaking Savoy it combined with pieces of Italy to restore the"
35461,"kingdom of Sardinia.  Austria and Hungary, already a sufficiently"
35461,"explosive mixture of discordant nationalities, Germans, Hungarians,"
35461,"Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs, Roumanians, and now Italians, was made"
35461,"still more impossible by confirming Austria’s Polish acquisitions of"
35461,"1772 and 1795.  The Catholic and republican-spirited Polish people were"
35461,"chiefly given over to the less civilized rule of the Greek-orthodox"
35461,"Tsar, but important districts went to Protestant Prussia. The Tsar was"
35461,"also confirmed in his acquisition of the entirely alien Finns.  The"
35461,"very dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish peoples were bound together under"
35461,"one king.  Germany, the reader will see, was left in a particularly"
35461,"dangerous state of muddle.  Prussia and Austria were both partly in and"
35461,"partly out of a German confederation, which included a multitude of"
35461,"minor states.  The King of Denmark came into the German confederation"
35461,"by virtue of certain German-speaking possessions in Holstein. "
35461,"Luxembourg was included in the German confederation, though its ruler"
35461,"was also King of the Netherlands, and though many of its peoples talked"
35461,"French."
35461,""
35461,"Here was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who talk"
35461,"German and base their ideas on German literature, the people who talk"
35461,"Italian and base their ideas on Italian literature, and the people who"
35461,"talk Polish and base their ideas on Polish literature, will all be far"

35461,"This was a journey of about 1,400 miles.  He was travelling with every"

35461,"had a steamer, the Clermont, with British-built engines, upon the"

35461,"also an American, the Phœnix, which went from New York (Hoboken) to"
35461,"Philadelphia.  So, too, was the first ship using steam (she also had"
35461,"sails) to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah (1819).  All these were"
35461,"paddle-wheel boats and paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in"
35461,"heavy seas. The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then"

35461,"steamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships.  After"
35461,"that the evolution in sea transport was rapid.  For the first time men"
35461,"began to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date"
35461,"of their arrival.  The transatlantic crossing, which had been an"
35461,"uncertain adventure of several weeks—which might stretch to months—was"
35461,"accelerated, until in 1910 it was brought down, in the case of the"
35461,"fastest boats, to under five days, with a practically notifiable hour"

35461,"Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea"
35461,"a new and striking addition to the facilities of human intercourse"
35461,"arose out of the investigations of Volta, Galvani and Faraday into"
35461,"various electrical phenomena.  The electric telegraph came into"
35461,"existence in 1835.  The first underseas cable was laid in 1851 between"
35461,"France and England. In a few years the telegraph system had spread over"
35461,"the civilized world, and news which had hitherto travelled slowly from"
35461,"point to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth."
35461,""
35461,"These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were to the"
35461,"popular imagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking"
35461,"and revolutionary of inventions, but they were only the most"
35461,"conspicuous and clumsy first fruits of a far more extensive process. "
35461,"Technical knowledge and skill were developing with an extraordinary"
35461,"rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of"
35461,"any previous age.  Far less conspicuous at first in everyday life, but"
35461,"finally far more important, was the extension of man’s power over"
35461,"various structural materials.  Before the middle of the eighteenth"
35461,"century iron was reduced from its ores by means of wood charcoal, was"
35461,"handled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape. It was"
35461,"material for a craftsman.  Quality and treatment were enormously"
35461,"dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individual"
35461,"iron-worker.  The largest masses of iron that could be dealt with under"
35461,"those conditions amounted at most (in the sixteenth century) to two or"
35461,"three tons.  (There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the"
35461,"size of cannon.)  The blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century and"
35461,"developed with the use of coke.  Not before the eighteenth century do"
35461,"we find rolled sheet iron (1728) and rolled rods and bars (1783). "
35461,"Nasmyth’s steam hammer came as late as 1838."
35461,""
35461,"The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not"
35461,"use steam.  The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could"
35461,"not develop before sheet iron was available.  The early engines seem to"
35461,"the modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they"
35461,"were the utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do. As"
35461,"late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently (1864) the"
35461,"open-hearth process, in which steel and every sort of iron could be"
35461,"melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard"
35461,"of.  To-day in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent"
35461,"steel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan.  Nothing in the"
35461,"previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its"
35461,"consequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and"
35461,"iron and over their texture and quality which man has now achieved. "
35461,"The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first"
35461,"triumphs of the new metallurgical methods.  Presently came ships of"
35461,"iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of building with steel upon"
35461,"a gigantic scale.  Men realized too late that they had planned their"
35461,"railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized"
35461,"their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much"
35461,"bigger scale."
35461,""
35461,"Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much"
35461,"over 2,000 tons burthen; now there is nothing wonderful about a"
35461,"50,000-ton liner.  There are people who sneer at this kind of progress"
35461,"as being a progress in “mere size,” but that sort of sneering merely"
35461,"marks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in it.  The"
35461,"great ship or the steel-frame building is not, as they imagine, a"
35461,"magnified version of the small ship or building of the past; it is a"
35461,"thing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and"
35461,"stronger materials; instead of being a thing of precedent and"
35461,"rule-of-thumb, it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation.  In"
35461,"the old house or ship, matter was dominant—the material and its needs"
35461,"had to be slavishly obeyed; in the new, matter had been captured,"
35461,"changed, coerced.  Think of the coal and iron and sand dragged out of"
35461,"the banks and pits, wrenched, wrought, molten and cast, to be flung at"
35461,"last, a slender glittering pinnacle of steel and glass, six hundred"
35461,"feet above the crowded city!"
35461,""
35461,"We have given these particulars of the advance in man’s knowledge of"
35461,"the metallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration.  A"
35461,"parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and"
35461,"of a multitude of metals, nickel and aluminium to name but two, unknown"
35461,"before the nineteenth century dawned.  It is in this great and growing"

35461,"plasters and the like, over colours and textures, that the main"
35461,"triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.  Yet"

35461,"making Britain and France the most rich and powerful countries in the"
35461,"world, it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and"

35461,""
35461,"There is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we have"
35461,"here called the mechanical revolution, which was an entirely new thing"
35461,"in human experience arising out of the development of organized"
35461,"science, a new step like the invention of agriculture or the discovery"
35461,"of metals, with something else, quite different in its origins,"
35461,"something for which there was already an historical precedent, the"
35461,"social and financial development which is called the _industrial"
35461,"revolution_. The two processes were going on together, they were"
35461,"constantly reacting upon each other, but they were in root and essence"
35461,"different. There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if"
35461,"there had been no coal, no steam, no machinery; but in that case it"
35461,"would probably have followed far more closely upon the lines of the"
35461,"social and financial developments of the later years of the Roman"
35461,"Republic. It would have repeated the story of dispossessed free"
35461,"cultivators, gang labour, great estates, great financial fortunes, and"
35461,"a socially destructive financial process. Even the factory method came"
35461,"before power and machinery. Factories were the product not of"
35461,"machinery, but of the “division of labour.” Drilled and sweated workers"
35461,"were making such things as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture, and"
35461,"colouring maps and book illustrations and so forth, before even"
35461,"water-wheels had been used for industrial purposes. There were"
35461,"factories in Rome in the days of Augustus. New books, for instance,"
35461,"were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the book-sellers."
35461,"The attentive student of Defoe and of the political pamphlets of"
35461,"Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people into"
35461,"establishments to work collectively for their living was already"
35461,"current in Britain before the close of the seventeenth century. There"
35461,"are intimations of it even as early as More’s _Utopia_ (1516). It was a"
35461,"social and not a mechanical development."
35461,""
35461,"Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic"
35461,"history of western Europe was in fact retreading the path along which"
35461,"the Roman state had gone in the last three centuries B.C.  But the"
35461,"political disunions of Europe, the political convulsions against"
35461,"monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk and perhaps also the"
35461,"greater accessibility of the western European intelligence to"
35461,"mechanical ideas and inventions, turned the process into quite novel"
35461,"directions.  Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were"
35461,"far more widely diffused in the newer European world, political power"
35461,"was not so concentrated, and the man of energy anxious to get rich"
35461,"turned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave"
35461,"and of gang labour to the idea of mechanical power and the machine."
35461,""
35461,"The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and"
35461,"discovery, was a new thing in human experience and it went on"
35461,"regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial"
35461,"consequences it might produce.  The industrial revolution, on the other"
35461,"hand, like most other human affairs, was and is more and more"
35461,"profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human"
35461,"conditions caused by the mechanical revolution.  And the essential"
35461,"difference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small"
35461,"farmers and small business men, and the phase of big finance in the"
35461,"latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the very"
35461,"similar concentration of capital in the eighteenth and nineteenth"
35461,"centuries on the other, lies in the profound difference in the"
35461,"character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about. "
35461,"The power of the old world was human power; everything depended"
35461,"ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of"
35461,"ignorant and subjugated men.  A little animal muscle, supplied by draft"
35461,"oxen, horse traction and the like, contributed.  Where a weight had to"
35461,"be lifted, men lifted it; where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped"
35461,"it out; where a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the"
35461,"Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of"
35461,"sweating rowers.  A vast proportion of mankind in the early"
35461,"civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its"
35461,"onset, power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release from"
35461,"such unintelligent toil.  Great gangs of men were employed in"
35461,"excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and embankments, and the"
35461,"like.  The number of miners increased enormously.  But the extension of"
35461,"facilities and the output of commodities increased much more.  And as"
35461,"the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new situation"
35461,"asserted itself more clearly.  Human beings were no longer wanted as a"
35461,"source of mere indiscriminated power.  What could be done mechanically"
35461,"by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine.  The"
35461,"human being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be"
35461,"exercised.  Human beings were wanted only as human beings.  The drudge,"
35461,"on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere"
35461,"obedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become"
35461,"unnecessary to the welfare of mankind."

35461,"nineteenth century went on, it became more and more plain to the"
35461,"intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be"
35461,"something better than a drudge.  He had to be educated—if only to"
35461,"secure “industrial efficiency.”  He had to understand what he was"
35461,"about. From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular"
35461,"education had been smouldering in Europe, just as it had smouldered in"
35461,"Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the necessity of"
35461,"making the believer understand a little of the belief by which he is"
35461,"saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred books by"
35461,"which his belief is conveyed. Christian controversies, with their"
35461,"competition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of"
35461,"popular education.  In England, for instance, by the thirties and"
35461,"forties of the nineteenth century, the disputes of the sects and the"
35461,"necessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of"
35461,"competing educational organizations for children, the church “National”"
35461,"schools, the dissenting “British” schools, and even Roman Catholic"
35461,"elementary schools.  The second half of the nineteenth century was a"
35461,"period of rapid advance in popular education throughout all the"
35461,"Westernized world.  There was no parallel advance in the education of"
35461,"the upper classes—some advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond—and"
35461,"so the great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the readers"
35461,"and the non-reading mass became little more than a slightly perceptible"
35461,"difference in educational level.  At the back of this process was the"
35461,"mechanical revolution, apparently regardless of social conditions, but"

35461,"bone, the tigress and her lair, the roaring stag and his herd, these"
35461,"are proprietorship blazing. No more nonsensical expression is"
35461,"conceivable in sociology than the term “primitive communism.”  The Old"
35461,"Man of the family tribe of early palæolithic times insisted upon his"
35461,"proprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visible"
35461,"universe.  If any other man wandered into his visible universe he"
35461,"fought him, and if he could he slew him. The tribe grew in the course"

35461,"gradual toleration by the Old Man of the existence of the younger men,"
35461,"and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from outside the"

35461,"make or capture or claim.  It seemed natural that a debtor who could"
35461,"not pay should become the property of his creditor. Equally natural was"
35461,"it that after claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments from"
35461,"anyone who wanted to use it. It was only slowly, as the possibilities"
35461,"of organized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in"
35461,"anything whatever began to be recognized as a nuisance.  Men found"
35461,"themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay! they found"
35461,"themselves born owned and claimed.  The social struggles of the earlier"
35461,"civilization are difficult to trace now, but the history we have told"
35461,"of the Roman Republic shows a community waking up to the idea that"
35461,"debts may become a public inconvenience and should then be repudiated,"
35461,"and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience.  We"
35461,"find that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in"
35461,"slaves.  Finally, we find in the teaching of that great revolutionist,"
35461,"Jesus of Nazareth, such an attack upon property as had never been"
35461,"before.  Easier it was, he said, for a camel to go through the eye of a"
35461,"needle than for the owner of great possessions to enter the kingdom of"
35461,"heaven.  A steady, continuous criticism of the permissible scope of"
35461,"property seems to have been going on in the world for the last"
35461,"twenty-five or thirty centuries.  Nineteen hundred years after Jesus of"
35461,"Nazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian"
35461,"teaching persuaded that there could be no property in human beings. "
35461,"And also the idea that a man may “do what he likes with his own” was"
35461,"very much shaken in relation to other sorts of property."
35461,""
35461,"But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the"
35461,"interrogative stage in this matter.  It had got nothing clear enough,"
35461,"much less settled enough, to act upon. One of its primary impulses was"
35461,"to protect property against the greed and waste of kings and the"
35461,"exploitation of noble adventurers.  It was largely to protect private"
35461,"property from taxation that the French Revolution began.  But the"
35461,"equalitarian formulæ of the Revolution carried it into a criticism of"
35461,"the very property it had risen to protect.  How can men be free and"
35461,"equal when numbers of them have no ground to stand upon and nothing to"
35461,"eat, and the owners will neither feed nor lodge them unless they toil? "
35461,"Excessively—the poor complained."
35461,""
35461,"To which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set"
35461,"about “dividing up.”  They wanted to intensify and universalize"
35461,"property.  Aiming at the same end by another route, there were the"
35461,"primitive socialists—or, to be more exact, communists—who wanted to"
35461,"“abolish” private property altogether. The state (a democratic state"
35461,"was of course understood) was to own all property."
35461,""
35461,"It is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of liberty"
35461,"and happiness should propose on the one hand to make property as"
35461,"absolute as possible, and on the other to put an end to it altogether. "
35461,"But so it was.  And the clue to this paradox is to be found in the fact"
35461,"that ownership is not one thing but a multitude of different things."
35461,""
35461,"It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to"
35461,"realize that property was not one simple thing, but a great complex of"
35461,"ownerships of different values and consequences, that many things (such"
35461,"as one’s body, the implements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are"
35461,"very profoundly and incurably one’s personal property, and that there"
35461,"is a very great range of things, railways, machinery of various sorts,"
35461,"homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure boats, for example, which need each"
35461,"to be considered very particularly to determine how far and under what"
35461,"limitations it may come under private ownership, and how far it falls"
35461,"into the public domain and may be administered and let out by the state"
35461,"in the collective interest.  On the practical side these questions pass"
35461,"into politics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficient state"
35461,"administration.  They open up issues in social psychology, and interact"
35461,"with the enquiries of educational science.  The criticism of property"
35461,"is still a vast and passionate ferment rather than a science.  On the"
35461,"one hand are the Individualists, who would protect and enlarge our"
35461,"present freedoms with what we possess, and on the other the Socialists"
35461,"who would in many directions pool our ownerships and restrain our"
35461,"proprietory acts.  In practice one will find every gradation between"
35461,"the extreme individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort"
35461,"to support a government, and the communist who would deny any"
35461,"possessions at all.  The ordinary socialist of to-day is what is called"
35461,"a collectivist; he would allow a considerable amount of private"
35461,"property but put such affairs as education, transport, mines,"
35461,"land-owning, most mass productions of staple articles, and the like,"
35461,"into the hands of a highly organized state.  Nowadays there does seem"
35461,"to be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate"
35461,"socialism scientifically studied and planned.  It is realized more and"
35461,"more clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate easily and"
35461,"successfully in large undertakings, and that every step towards a more"
35461,"complex state and every function that the state takes over from private"
35461,"enterprise, necessitates a corresponding educational advance and the"
35461,"organization of a proper criticism and control.  Both the press and the"
35461,"political methods of the contemporary state are far too crude for any"
35461,"large extension of collective activities."
35461,""
35461,"But for a time the stresses between employer and employed and"
35461,"particularly between selfish employers and reluctant workers, led to a"
35461,"world-wide dissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of"
35461,"communism which is associated with the name of Marx.  Marx based his"
35461,"theories on a belief that men’s minds are limited by their economic"
35461,"necessities, and that there is a necessary conflict of interests in our"
35461,"present civilization between the prosperous and employing classes of"
35461,"people and the employed mass.  With the advance in education"
35461,"necessitated by the mechanical revolution, this great employed majority"
35461,"will become more and more class-conscious and more and more solid in"
35461,"antagonism to the (class- conscious) ruling minority.  In some way the"
35461,"class-conscious workers would seize power, he prophesied, and"
35461,"inaugurate a new social state.  The antagonism, the insurrection, the"
35461,"possible revolution are understandable enough, but it does not follow"
35461,"that a new social state or anything but a socially destructive process"
35461,"will ensue.  Put to the test in Russia, Marxism, as we shall note"
35461,"later, has proved singularly uncreative."

35461,"truer that the whole planet is now one economic community, that the"
35461,"proper exploitation of its natural resources demands one comprehensive"
35461,"direction, and that the greater power and range that discovery has"

35461,"Abraham Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new"
35461,"people that had grown up after the War of Independence.  His early"
35461,"years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward"
35461,"flow of the population.  He was born in Kentucky (1809), was taken to"
35461,"Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois.  Life was rough in the"
35461,"backwoods of Indiana in those days; the house was a mere log cabin in"
35461,"the wilderness, and his schooling was poor and casual.  But his mother"
35461,"taught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader.  At"
35461,"seventeen he was a big athletic youth, a great wrestler and runner.  He"
35461,"worked for a time as clerk in a store, went into business as a"
35461,"storekeeper with a drunken partner, and contracted debts that he did"
35461,"not fully pay off for fifteen years.  In 1834, when he was still only"
35461,"five and twenty, he was elected member of the House of Representatives"
35461,"for the State of Illinois.  In Illinois particularly the question of"
35461,"slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the extension"
35461,"of slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois. "
35461,"Douglas was a man of great ability and prestige, and for some years"
35461,"Lincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to"
35461,"the position of his most formidable and finally victorious antagonist. "
35461,"Their culminating struggle was the presidential campaign of 1860, and"
35461,"on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President, with"

35461,"federal government at Washington, and committing acts of war."

35461,"This civil war in America was fought by improvised armies that grew"

35461,"was followed by counter thrust; hope gave way to despondency, and"
35461,"returned and was again disappointed. Sometimes Washington seemed within"
35461,"the Confederate grasp; again the Federal armies were driving towards"
35461,"Richmond.  The Confederates, outnumbered and far poorer in resources,"
35461,"fought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee.  The"
35461,"generalship of the Union was far inferior.  Generals were dismissed,"
35461,"new generals appointed; until at last, under Sherman and Grant, came"
35461,"victory over the ragged and depleted South.  In October, 1864, a"

35461,"marched down from Tennessee through Georgia to the coast, right across"
35461,"the Confederate country, and then turned up through the Carolinas,"
35461,"coming in upon the rear of the Confederate armies.  Meanwhile Grant"
35461,"held Lee before Richmond until Sherman closed on him.  On April 9th,"

35461,"The end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting empires"
35461,"and disillusioned expansionists. The long and tedious journey between"
35461,"Britain and Spain and their colonies in America prevented any really"
35461,"free coming and going between the home land and the daughter lands, and"
35461,"so the colonies separated into new and distinct communities, with"
35461,"distinctive ideas and interests and even modes of speech. As they grew"
35461,"they strained more and more at the feeble and uncertain link of"
35461,"shipping that had joined them. Weak trading-posts in the wilderness,"
35461,"like those of France in Canada, or trading establishments in great"
35461,"alien communities, like those of Britain in India, might well cling for"
35461,"bare existence to the nation which gave them support and a reason for"
35461,"their existence. That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the"
35461,"early part of the nineteenth century to be the limit set to overseas"
35461,"rule. In 1820 the sketchy great European “empires” outside of Europe"
35461,"that had figured so bravely in the maps of the middle eighteenth"

35461,"the duty of the historian to record that it was so accepted. There was"

35461,"shaping of human destinies; she has received much, but she has given"
35461,"little.  The Japanese proper are of the Mongolian race.  Their"
35461,"civilization, their writing and their literary and artistic traditions"
35461,"are derived from the Chinese.  Their history is an interesting and"

35461,"in the earlier centuries of the Christian era; their attacks upon Korea"
35461,"and China are an Eastern equivalent of the English wars in France. "
35461,"Japan was first brought into contact with Europe in the sixteenth"
35461,"century; in 1542 some Portuguese reached it in a Chinese junk, and in"
35461,"1549 a Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier, began his teaching there. "
35461,"For a time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and the Christian"
35461,"missionaries made a great number of converts.  A certain William Adams"
35461,"became the most trusted European adviser of the Japanese, and showed"
35461,"them how to build big ships.  There were voyages in Japanese-built"
35461,"ships to India and Peru.  Then arose complicated quarrels between the"
35461,"Spanish Dominicans, the Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and Dutch"
35461,"Protestants, each warning the Japanese against the political designs of"
35461,"the others.  The Jesuits, in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and"
35461,"insulted the Buddhists with great acrimony.  In the end the Japanese"
35461,"came to the conclusion that the Europeans were an intolerable nuisance,"
35461,"and that Catholic Christianity in particular was a mere cloak for the"
35461,"political dreams of the Pope and the Spanish monarchy—already in"
35461,"possession of the Philippine Islands; there was a great persecution of"
35461,"the Christians, and in 1638 Japan was absolutely closed to Europeans,"
35461,"and remained closed for over 200 years.  During those two centuries the"
35461,"Japanese were as completely cut off from the rest of the world as"

35461,"steady improvement in the size and range of the guns employed and of"
35461,"such ingenious devices as poison-gas shells and the small mobile forts"
35461,"known as tanks, to break down the resistance of troops in the trenches."
35461," The air offensive was the most revolutionary of all the new methods. "
35461,"It carried warfare from two dimensions into three.  Hitherto in the"
35461,"history of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and"
35461,"met.  Now it went on everywhere.  First the Zeppelin and then the"
35461,"bombing aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an ever-"
35461,"increasing area of civilian activities beyond.  The old distinction"
35461,"maintained in civilized warfare between the civilian and combatant"
35461,"population disappeared.  Everyone who grew food, or who sewed a"
35461,"garment, everyone who felled a tree or repaired a house, every railway"
35461,"station and every warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction. "
35461,"The air offensive increased in range and terror with every month in the"
35461,"war.  At last great areas of Europe were in a state of siege and"
35461,"subject to nightly raids.  Such exposed cities as London and Paris"
35461,"passed sleepless night after sleepless night while the bombs burst, the"
35461,"anti-aircraft guns maintained an intolerable racket, and the fire"
35461,"engines and ambulances rattled headlong through the darkened and"
35461,"deserted streets. The effects upon the minds and health of old people"
35461,"and of young children were particularly distressing and destructive."
35461,""
35461,"Pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the very"
35461,"end of the fighting in 1918.  For four years medical science staved off"
35461,"any general epidemic; then came a great outbreak of influenza about the"
35461,"world which destroyed many millions of people.  Famine also was staved"
35461,"off for some time.  By the beginning of 1918 however most of Europe was"
35461,"in a state of mitigated and regulated famine.  The production of food"
35461,"throughout the world had fallen very greatly through the calling off of"
35461,"peasant mankind to the fronts, and the distribution of such food as was"
35461,"produced was impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine, by the"
35461,"rupture of customary routes through the closing of frontiers, and by"
35461,"the disorganization of the transport system of the world. The various"
35461,"governments took possession of the dwindling food supplies, and, with"
35461,"more or less success, rationed their populations.  By the fourth year"
35461,"the whole world was suffering from shortages of clothing and housing"
35461,"and of most of the normal gear of life as well as of food.  Business"
35461,"and economic life were profoundly disorganized.  Every-one was worried,"
35461,"and most people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort."
35461,""
35461,"The actual warfare ceased in November, 1918.  After a supreme effort in"
35461,"the spring of 1918 that almost carried the Germans to Paris, the"
35461,"Central Powers collapsed.  They had come to an end of their spirit and"
35461,"resources."

35461,""
35461,""
35461,"But a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers the"
35461,"half oriental monarchy of Russia, which had professed to be the"
35461,"continuation of the Byzantine Empire, had collapsed. The Tsardom had"
35461,"been showing signs of profound rottenness for some years before the"
35461,"war; the court was under the sway of a fantastic religious impostor,"
35461,"Rasputin, and the public administration, civil and military, was in a"
35461,"state of extreme inefficiency and corruption. At the outset of the war"
35461,"there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia. A vast"
35461,"conscript army was called up, for which there was neither adequate"
35461,"military equipment nor a proper supply of competent officers, and this"
35461,"great host, ill supplied and badly handled, was hurled against the"
35461,"German and Austrian frontiers."
35461,""
35461,"There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in"
35461,"East Prussia in September, 1914, diverted the energies and attention of"
35461,"the Germans from their first victorious drive upon Paris.  The"
35461,"sufferings and deaths of scores of thousands of ill-led Russian"
35461,"peasants saved France from complete overthrow in that momentous opening"
35461,"campaign, and made all western Europe the debtors of that great and"
35461,"tragic people.  But the strain of the war upon this sprawling,"
35461,"ill-organized empire was too heavy for its strength.  The Russian"
35461,"common soldiers were sent into battle without guns to support them,"
35461,"without even rifle ammunition; they were wasted by their officers and"
35461,"generals in a delirium of militarist enthusiasm.  For a time they"
35461,"seemed to be suffering mutely as the beasts suffer; but there is a"
35461,"limit to the endurance even of the most ignorant.  A profound disgust"
35461,"for Tsardom was creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted"
35461,"men.  From the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source of deepening"
35461,"anxiety to her Western Allies.  Throughout 1916 she remained largely on"
35461,"the defensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace with Germany."
35461,""
35461,"On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner"
35461,"party in Petrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the Tsardom"
35461,"in order.  By March things were moving rapidly; food riots in Petrograd"
35461,"developed into a revolutionary insurrection; there was an attempted"
35461,"suppression of the Duma, the representative body, there were attempted"
35461,"arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of a provisional government"
35461,"under Prince Lvoff, and an abdication (March 15th) by the Tsar.  For a"
35461,"time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be"
35461,"possible—perhaps under a new Tsar.  Then it became evident that the"
35461,"destruction of popular confidence in Russia had gone too far for any"
35461,"such adjustments. The Russian people were sick to death of the old"
35461,"order of things in Europe, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers; it"
35461,"wanted relief, and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.  The"
35461,"Allies had no understanding of Russian realities; their diplomatists"
35461,"were ignorant of Russian, genteel persons with their attention directed"
35461,"to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered steadily"
35461,"with the new situation.  There was little goodwill among these"
35461,"diplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition to embarrass"
35461,"the new government as much as possible.  At the head of the Russian"
35461,"republican government was an eloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky,"
35461,"who found himself assailed by the forces of a profounder revolutionary"
35461,"movement, the “social revolution,” at home and cold-shouldered by the"
35461,"Allied governments abroad.  His Allies would neither let him give the"
35461,"Russian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their"
35461,"frontiers.  The French and the British press pestered their exhausted"
35461,"ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently the Germans made a"
35461,"strong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed"
35461,"before the prospect of a Baltic expedition in relief.  The new Russian"
35461,"Republic had to fight unsupported.  In spite of their naval"
35461,"predominance and the bitter protests of the great English admiral, Lord"
35461,"Fisher (1841-1920), it is to be noted that the British and their"
35461,"Allies, except for some submarine attacks, left the Germans the"
35461,"complete mastery of the Baltic throughout the war."
35461,""
35461,"The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war.  At any"
35461,"cost.  There had come into existence in Petrograd a body representing"
35461,"the workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured"
35461,"for an international conference of socialists at Stockholm.  Food riots"
35461,"were occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness in Austria and"
35461,"Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in the light of"
35461,"subsequent events, that such a conference would have precipitated a"
35461,"reasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution. "
35461,"Kerensky implored his Western allies to allow this conference to take"
35461,"place, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak of socialism and"
35461,"republicanism, they refused, in spite of the favourable response of a"
35461,"small majority of the British Labour Party.  Without either moral or"
35461,"physical help from the Allies, the unhappy “moderate” Russian Republic"
35461,"still fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in July.  It"
35461,"failed after some preliminary successes, and there came another great"
35461,"slaughtering of Russians."
35461,""
35461,"The limit of Russian endurance was reached.  Mutinies broke out in the"
35461,"Russian armies, and particularly upon the northern front, and on"
35461,"November 7th, 1917, Kerensky’s government was overthrown and power was"
35461,"seized by the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under"
35461,"Lenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of the Western powers.  On"
35461,"March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between Russia and Germany was signed"

35461,"It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men of"
35461,"a very different quality from the rhetorical constitutionalists and"
35461,"revolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.  They were fanatical Marxist"
35461,"communists.  They believed that their accession to power in Russia was"
35461,"only the opening of a world-wide social revolution, and they set about"
35461,"changing the social and economic order with the thoroughness of perfect"
35461,"faith and absolute inexperience.  The western European and the American"
35461,"governments were themselves much too ill-informed and incapable to"
35461,"guide or help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself"
35461,"to discredit and the ruling classes to wreck these usurpers upon any"
35461,"terms and at any cost to themselves or to Russia.  A propaganda of"
35461,"abominable and disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the press of"
35461,"the world; the Bolshevik leaders were represented as incredible"
35461,"monsters glutted with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality"
35461,"before which the realities of the Tsarist court during the Rasputin"
35461,"regime paled to a white purity.  Expeditions were launched at the"
35461,"exhausted country, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed and"
35461,"subsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or too monstrous for"
35461,"the frightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime.  In 1919, the Russian"
35461,"Bolsheviks, ruling a country already exhausted and disorganized by five"
35461,"years of intensive warfare, were fighting a British Expedition at"
35461,"Archangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern Siberia, Roumanians with French"
35461,"and Greek contingents in the south, the Russian Admiral Koltchak in"
35461,"Siberia and General Deniken, supported by the French fleet, in the"
35461,"Crimea.  In July of that year an Esthonian army, under General"
35461,"Yudenitch, almost got to Petersburg.  In 1920 the Poles, incited by the"
35461,"French, made a new attack on Russia; and a new reactionary raider,"
35461,"General Wrangel, took over the task of General Deniken in invading and"
35461,"devastating his own country.  In March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt"
35461,"revolted.  The Russian Government under its president, Lenin, survived"
35461,"all these various attacks.  It showed an amazing tenacity, and the"
35461,"common people of Russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of"
35461,"extreme hardship.  By the end of 1921 both Britain and Italy had made a"
35461,"sort of recognition of the communist rule."
35461,""
35461,"But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle against"
35461,"foreign intervention and internal revolt, it was far less happy in its"
35461,"attempts to set up a new social order based upon communist ideas in"
35461,"Russia.  The Russian peasant is a small land-hungry proprietor, as far"
35461,"from communism in his thoughts and methods as a whale is from flying;"
35461,"the revolution gave him the land of the great landowners but could not"
35461,"make him grow food for anything but negotiable money, and the"
35461,"revolution, among other things, had practically destroyed the value of"
35461,"money. Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the"
35461,"collapse of the railways through war-strain, shrank to a mere"
35461,"cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.  The"
35461,"towns starved.  Hasty and ill-planned attempts to make over industrial"
35461,"production in accordance with communist ideas were equally"
35461,"unsuccessful.  By 1920 Russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of"
35461,"a modern civilization in complete collapse.  Railways were rusting and"
35461,"passing out of use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was"
35461,"an immense mortality.  Yet the country still fought with its enemies at"
35461,"its gates.  In 1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant"

35461,"The scheme and scale upon which this History is planned do not permit"
35461,"us to enter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes that centre"
35461,"about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which"
35461,"concluded the Great War. We are beginning to realize that that"
35461,"conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended nothing, began nothing"
35461,"and settled nothing. It killed millions of people; it wasted and"
35461,"impoverished the world. It smashed Russia altogether. It was at best an"
35461,"acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and"
35461,"confusedly without much plan or foresight in a dangerous and"
35461,"unsympathetic universe. The crudely organized egotisms and passions of"

35461,"The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to"
35461,"do more than carry out the conflicts and defeats of the war to their"
35461,"logical conclusions.  The Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians were"
35461,"permitted no share in its deliberations; they were only to accept the"
35461,"decisions it dictated to them.  From the point of view of human welfare"
35461,"the choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate.  It"
35461,"was at Versailles in 1871 that, with every circumstance of triumphant"
35461,"vulgarity, the new German Empire had been proclaimed.  The suggestion"
35461,"of a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors,"
35461,"was overpowering."
35461,""
35461,"Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great"
35461,"War had long been exhausted.  The populations of the victorious"
35461,"countries were acutely aware of their own losses and sufferings, and"
35461,"entirely regardless of the fact that the defeated had paid in the like"
35461,"manner.  The war had arisen as a natural and inevitable consequence of"
35461,"the competitive nationalisms of Europe and the absence of any Federal"
35461,"adjustment of these competitive forces; war is the necessary logical"
35461,"consummation of independent sovereign nationalities living in too small"

35461,"it will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty"
35461,"or thirty years’ time if no political unification anticipates and"
35461,"prevents it.  States organized for war will make wars as surely as hens"

35461,"America, President Wilson.  Its chief support was in America.  So far"
35461,"the United States, this new modern state, had developed no distinctive"
35461,"ideas of international relationship beyond the Monroe Doctrine, which"
35461,"protected the new world from European interference. Now suddenly it was"
35461,"called upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the"
35461,"time.  It had none.  The natural disposition of the American people was"
35461,"towards a permanent world peace.  With this however was linked a strong"
35461,"traditional distrust of old-world polities and a habit of isolation"
35461,"from old-world entanglements. The Americans had hardly begun to think"
35461,"out an American solution of world problems when the submarine campaign"
35461,"of the Germans dragged them into the war on the side of the anti-German"
35461,"allies. President Wilson’s scheme of a League of Nations was an attempt"
35461,"at short notice to create a distinctively American world project.  It"
35461,"was a sketchy, inadequate and dangerous scheme.  In Europe however it"
35461,"was taken as a matured American point of view. The generality of"
35461,"mankind in 1918-19 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any"
35461,"sacrifice to erect barriers against its recurrence, but there was not a"
35461,"single government in the old world willing to waive one iota of its"
35461,"sovereign independence to attain any such end.  The public utterances"
35461,"of President Wilson leading up to the project of a World League of"
35461,"Nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the"
35461,"governments to the peoples of the world; they were taken as expressing"
35461,"the ripe intentions of America, and the response was enormous. "
35461,"Unhappily President Wilson had to deal with governments and not with"
35461,"peoples; he was a man capable of tremendous flashes of vision and yet"
35461,"when put to the test egotistical and limited, and the great wave of"
35461,"enthusiasm he evoked passed and was wasted."

35461,"Says Dr. Dillon in his book, _The Peace Conference:_ “Europe, when the"
35461,"President touched its shores, was as clay ready for the creative"

35461,"would take them to the long-promised land where wars are prohibited and"
35461,"blockades unknown.  And to their thinking he was just that great"
35461,"leader.  In France men bowed down before him with awe and affection. "
35461,"Labour leaders in Paris told me that they shed tears of joy in his"
35461,"presence, and that their comrades would go through fire and water to"
35461,"help him to realize his noble schemes.  To the working classes in Italy"
35461,"his name was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would"
35461,"be renewed. The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their"
35461,"sheet-anchor of safety.  The fearless Herr Muehlon said: ‘If President"
35461,"Wilson were to address the Germans and pronounce a severe sentence upon"
35461,"them, they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and"
35461,"set to work at once.’  In German-Austria his fame was that of a"
35461,"saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering"
35461,"and surcease of sorrow to the afflicted ... .”"
35461,""
35461,"Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised."
35461,"How completely he disappointed them and how weak and futile was the"
35461,"League of Nations he made is too long and too distressful a story to"
35461,"tell here. He exaggerated in his person our common human tragedy, he"
35461,"was so very great in his dreams and so incapable in his performance."
35461,"America dissented from the acts of its President and would not join the"
35461,"League Europe accepted from him. There was a slow realization on the"
35461,"part of the American people that it had been rushed into something for"
35461,"which it was totally unprepared. There was a corresponding realization"
35461,"on the part of Europe that America had nothing ready to give to the old"
35461,"world in its extremity. Born prematurely and crippled at its birth,"
35461,"that League has become indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical"
35461,"constitution and its manifest limitations of power, a serious obstacle"
35461,"in the way of any effective reorganization of international"
35461,"relationships. The problem would be a clearer one if the League did not"

35461,"the project, that readiness of men everywhere round and about the"
35461,"earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments, for a world"
35461,"control of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in any history."
