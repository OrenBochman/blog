37431,"the same parish. My own father, who, to be frank, was steward of the"
37431,"Darcy estates, gave up everything to serve the interests of the Darcy"
37431,"family. Mr. Darcy's father was excessively attached to me:--indeed, I"
37431,"was his godson. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had"
37431,"done so. I was destined for the church and Mr. Darcy's father left to me"
37431,"a most valuable living. But the present Mr. Darcy chose to ignore his"
37431,"father's will and gave the living to another man. This closed for me the"
37431,"career for which I was most fitted and left me with almost no means of"

37431,""

37431,""
37431,"I must attribute it in some measure to his jealousy. His father's"

37431,"surmised that I am about to ask you to become the companion of my life."

37431,"father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy"

37431,"false. I do not know the particulars, but I do know that George Wickham"
37431,"has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. His coming into the"
37431,"county at all is a most insolent thing. I feel very strongly on this"

37431,""
37431,"COLONEL FITZWILLIAM."

37431,"It is a circumstance which, of course, Darcy could not wish to be"

37431,"on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most"
37431,"imprudent marriage, but without names or any other particulars, and I"
37431,"only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him to be the kind of"

37431,""
37431,"[_Growing excited._] I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on"
37431,"the propriety of his friend's inclination; why, upon his _own_ judgment"
37431,"alone, Mr. Darcy was to determine in what manner his friend was to be"
37431,"happy. [_Recovering herself._] But as we know none of the particulars,"
37431,"it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was"
37431,"much affection in the case."
37431,""
37431,""
37431,"COLONEL FITZWILLIAM."
37431,""
37431,"That is not an unnatural surmise, and I believe Darcy told me that he"

37431,"matter. However, to lessen the affection on either side is to lessen the"
37431,"honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

37431,"Oh, if Jane were married to Bingley to-morrow, I should think she had as"

37431,"encourage me in it, and my dear Charlotte is ever willing that I should"
37431,"leave her side for the sake of this healthful exercise. [_Looking at the"
37431,"radishes again._] It is, indeed, a pity that Miss de Bourg is not well"
37431,"enough to enjoy them. My dear Charlotte has doubtless told you, Miss"
37431,"Elizabeth, of the alliance which is in prospect between Miss de Bourg"

37431,"of your nearest relations, the total lack of propriety so frequently"
37431,"betrayed by your family, has so opposed my judgment to my inclination,"
37431,"that it has required the utmost force of passion on my part to put them"
37431,"aside. But, my dear Miss Bennet, your triumph is complete. Your own"

37431,"this, I am sure, you did not intend. Indeed I understand your whole"

37431,"reading a sermon. I didn't hear one word in ten of it all. I was"
37431,"thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be"
37431,"married in his blue coat. Well, we got to church, and then my uncle gave"
37431,"me a fright after we got there, because he was so late, and he was going"

37431,"[_A little calmer._] No--no, Jane, it must be true. I can put things"

37431,"You are mistaken. I know his motive. He feels that he is responsible"

37431,"all this would never have happened, had he done his duty. And now, he"
37431,"will despise us. He will never wish to see us again as long as he lives!"
