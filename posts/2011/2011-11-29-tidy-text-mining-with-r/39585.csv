39585,"INTRODUCTION"
39585,""
39585,"By H.G. WELLS"
39585,""
39585,"Your egoist, like the solitary beasts, lives only for himself; your"
39585,"altruist declares that he lives only for others; for either there may be"
39585,"success or failure but for neither can there be tragedy. For even if the"
39585,"altruist meets nothing but ingratitude, what has he to complain of? His"
39585,"premises abolish his grounds of complaint. But both egoist and altruist"
39585,"are philosophical abstractions. The human being by nature and necessity"
39585,"is neither egoist nor altruist; he trims a difficult course between the"
39585,"two; for the most part we are, within the limits of our powers of"
39585,"expression, _egotists_, and our desire is to think and if possible talk"
39585,"and write about this marvellous experiment of ourselves, with all the"
39585,"world--or as much as we can conveniently assemble--for audience. There"
39585,"is variety in our styles. Some drape the central figure; some let it"
39585,"rather appear than call attention to it; some affect a needless"
39585,"frankness: ""_I_ am an egotist, mind you, and I pretend nothing else"";"
39585,"some by adopting a pose with accessories do at least develop so great"
39585,"and passionate an interest in the accessories as to generalise and"
39585,"escape more or less completely from self. An egotism like an eggshell is"
39585,"a thing from which to escape; the art of life is that escape. The"
39585,"fundamental art of life is to recover the sense of that great"
39585,"self-forgetful continuous life from which we have individually budded"
39585,"off. Many people have done this through religion, which begins with a"
39585,"tremendous clamour to some saviour god or other to recognise us and ends"
39585,"in our recognition of him; or through science, when your egotist begins"
39585,"with: ""Behold me! I, I your humble servant, am a scientific man, devoted"
39585,"to the clear statement of truth,"" and ends with so passionate a"
39585,"statement of truth that self is forgotten altogether."
39585,""
39585,"In this diary of an intensely egotistical young naturalist, tragically"
39585,"caught by the creeping approach of death, we have one of the most moving"
39585,"records of the youthful aspects of our universal struggle. We begin with"
39585,"one of those bright schoolboys that most of us like to fancy we once"
39585,"were, that many of us have come to love as sons or nephews or younger"
39585,"brothers, and this youngster is attracted by natural science, by the"
39585,"employments of the naturalist and by the thought of being himself some"
39585,"day a naturalist. From the very beginning we find in this diary the"
39585,"three qualities, from the narrowest to broadest. ""Observe me,"" he says"
39585,"to himself, ""I am observing nature."" There is the self-conscious,"
39585,"self-centred boy. But he also says ""I am observing nature!"" And at"
39585,"moments comes the clear light. He forgets himself in the twilight cave"
39585,"with the bats or watching the starlings in the evening sky, he becomes"
39585,"just you and I and the mind of mankind gathering knowledge. And the"
39585,"diary, as the keen edge of untimely fate cuts down into the sensitive"
39585,"tissue, shows us presently, after outcries and sorrow and darkness of"
39585,"spirit, the habits of the observer rising to the occasion. Not for him,"
39585,"he realises, are the long life, the honours of science, the Croonian"
39585,"lecture, the listening Royal Society, one's memory embalmed in specific"
39585,"or generic names, the sure place in the temple of fame, that once filled"
39585,"his boyish dreams. But here is something close at hand to go on"
39585,"observing manfully to the end, in which self may be forgotten, and that"
39585,"is his own tormented self, with desire still great and power and hope"
39585,"receding. ""I will go on with this diary,"" I read between the lines. ""You"
39585,"shall have at least one specimen, carefully displayed and labelled. Here"
39585,"is a recorded unhappiness. When you talk about life and the rewards of"
39585,"life and the justice of life and its penalties, what you say must square"
39585,"with this."""
39585,""
39585,"Such is what we have here. It will be going beyond the necessities of"
39585,"this preface to expatiate upon a certain thread of unpremeditated and"
39585,"exquisite beauty that runs through the story this diary tells. To all"
39585,"sensitive readers it will be plain enough, and those who cannot see it"
39585,"plain do not deserve to have it underlined for them, that, still"
39585,"unseeing, they may pretend to see. Nor need we dilate upon the"
39585,"development of the quality of this diary from the rather fussy egotism"
39585,"of the earlier half. But it may be well to add a few explanatory facts"
39585,"that the opening chapters rather take for granted. Barbellion began life"
39585,"at a material as well as a physical disadvantage; neither of his parents"
39585,"were sturdy people, his mother died at last of constitutional heart"
39585,"weakness, and his father belonged to that most unfortunate class, the"
39585,"poor educated, who live lives of worry in straitened circumstances."
39585,"Barbellion's father was a newspaper reporter in a west country town, his"
39585,"income rarely exceeded a couple of hundred pounds a year; the"
39585,"educational facilities of the place were poor, and young Barbellion had"
39585,"to get such learning as he could as a day boy at a small private school,"
39585,"his father supplementing this meagre training and presently taking him"
39585,"on as an apprentice reporter. How the passion for natural science arose"
39585,"does not appear in this diary; we already find the naturalist formed in"
39585,"the first schoolboy entries. An uncle, a chemist, seems to have"
39585,"encouraged the tendency, and to have given him textbooks and other help."
39585,"Somehow at any rate he acquired a considerable amount of knowledge; by"
39585,"the time he was eighteen he was already publishing quite excellent"
39585,"observations of his own in such periodicals as the _Zoologist_, and by"
39585,"the time he was twenty he could secure an appointment as assistant"
39585,"naturalist to the director of a well-known marine biological station. It"
39585,"was a success, as the reader will learn, gained only to be renounced."
39585,"His father was ill and he had to stand by his family; our economical"
39585,"country cannot afford to make biologists out of men who can earn a"
39585,"living as hack reporters. Poverty and science are sisters wherever the"
39585,"flag of Britain waves; for how could the rich live if we wasted money on"
39585,"that sort of thing? But the dream was not altogether abandoned, and in"
39585,"1911 Barbellion got a post, one of the dozen or so of rare and coveted"
39585,"opportunities to toil in a scientific atmosphere that our Empire"
39585,"affords; he secured an assistantship at the Natural History Museum,"
39585,"South Kensington, to which a living wage was attached, a fair equivalent"
39585,"to a reporter's earnings. The rest of the story needs no helping out."
39585,"Let me only add that since 1911 Barbellion, in spite of his steadily"
39585,"diminishing strength, has published articles in both British and"
39585,"American periodicals, that entirely justify the statement that in him"
39585,"biological science loses one of the most promising of its recent"
39585,"recruits. His scientific work is not only full and exact but it has"
39585,"those literary qualities, the grace, the power of handling, the breadth"
39585,"of reference, which have always distinguished the best English"
39585,"biological work, and which mark off at once the true scientific man from"
39585,"the mere collector and recorder of items. With this much introduction"
39585,"Barbellion may be left to tell the tragedy of his hopes and of the dark,"
39585,"unforeseen, unforeseeable, and inexplicable fate that has overtaken"
39585,"him."

39585,"as Gimbo and Bounce were with us, and it would look like poaching. Later"

39585,"old farmer giving us a severe chase. There were innumerable rabbits in"
39585,"the wood, so, of course, the dogs barked hard. I gave them a sound"
39585,"beating when we got back out of danger, The old farmer is known as ""Bale"

39585,"I was glad yesterday to see the egg season so well in. I shall have to"

39585,"grasshoppers are beginning to stridulate, yet Burke describes these"
39585,"little creatures as being ""loud and troublesome"" and the chirp"
39585,"unpleasant. Like Samuel Johnson, he must have preferred brick walls to"
39585,"green hedges. Many people go for a walk and yet are unable to admire"
39585,"Nature simply because their power of observation is untrained. Of course"
39585,"some are not suited to the study at all and do not trouble themselves"

39585,"Went out with L---- to try to see the squirrels again. We could not find"
39585,"one and were just wondering if we should draw blank when L---- noticed"
39585,"one clinging to the bark of a tree with a nut in its mouth. We gave it a"
39585,"good chase, but it escaped into the thickest part of the fir tree, still"
39585,"carrying the nut, and we gave up firing at it. Later on, L---- got"
39585,"foolishly mischievous--owing, I suppose, to our lack of sport--and"
39585,"unhinged a gate which he carried two yards into a copse, and threw it on"
39585,"the ground. Just then, he saw the Squirrel again and jumped over the"
39585,"hedge into the copse, chasing it from tree to tree with his catty."
39585,"Having lost it, he climbed a fir tree into a Squirrel's drey at the top"
39585,"and sat there on the tree top, and I, below, was just going to lift the"
39585,"gate back when I looked up and saw a farmer watching me, menacing and"
39585,"silent. I promptly dropped the gate and fled. L---- from his Squirrel's"
39585,"drey, not knowing what had happened, called out to me about the"
39585,"nest--that there was nothing in it. The man looked up and asked him who"
39585,"he was and who I was. L---- would not say and would not come down. The"
39585,"farmer said he would come up. L---- answered that if he did he would"

39585,"a lame Curlew which could hardly fly. I gave chase, but it managed to"
39585,"scramble over a gut full of water about two yards wide. D---- took off"
39585,"his boots and stockings and carried me over on his back, and we both"
39585,"raced across the sands to where the Curlew lay in an exhausted state. I"
39585,"picked him up and carried him off under my arm, like the boy with the"
39585,"Goose that laid the golden eggs. All the time, the bird screamed loudly,"
39585,"opening its enormously long bill and struggling to escape. Arrived at"
39585,"the gut again, we found that the incoming tide had made the gut wider"
39585,"and deeper so that we were cut off from the mainland, and found it"
39585,"necessary to wade across at once before it got deeper. As I had to carry"
39585,"a pair of field-glasses as well as my boots and stockings, I handed over"
39585,"the struggling bird to D----. While wading across, I suddenly sank to my"
39585,"waist in a sandpit. This frightened me, and I was glad to reach the"
39585,"other side in safety. But on arrival I found D----, but no Curlew. In"
39585,"wading across the current, he grew flurried and let it go. The tide"

39585,"_A Character_"
39585,""
39585,"For this world's unfortunates, his is the ripe sympathy of a"
39585,"well-developed nature, standing in strong contrast with the rest of his"
39585,"personality, which is wholly self-centred, a little ungenerous, and what"
39585,"strong men of impeccable character call ""weak."" If you are ill he is"
39585,"delightful, if you are robust or successful he can be very"
39585,"objectionable. To an influenza victim he goes out of his way to carry a"
39585,"book, but if you tell him with gusto you have passed your exam, he says,"
39585,"""Oh, but there's not much behind it, is there?"" ""Oh! no,"" I answer,"
39585,"comforting him, ""it is really a misfortune to be a success."" And so only"
39585,"the bankrupts, dipsos (as he calls them), ne'er-do-weels, and sudden"
39585,"deaths ever touch his heart or tap his sympathy. He is a short, queery,"
39585,"dressy little fellow, always spruce and clean. His joy consists in a"
39585,"glass of beer, a full stomach, a good cigar, or a pretty girl to flirt"
39585,"with. He frequents drinking saloons and billiard rooms, goes to dances"
39585,"and likes to be thought a lady's man. ""Urn,"" he will say, with the air"
39585,"of a connoisseur, ""a little too broad in the beam,"" as some attractive"
39585,"damsel walks down the street. Any day about twelve you can see both of"
39585,"us, ""the long and the short of it"" (he is only half my height and I call"
39585,"him .5), walking together in the Park, and engaged in the most heated"
39585,"discussion over some entirely trivial matter, such as whether he would"
39585,"marry a woman with sore eyes, etc., etc. More than once we have caught"
39585,"cabmen idle on the cab-rank or policemen on point duty jerking their"
39585,"thumbs backward at us and expressing some facetious remarks which we"
39585,"longed to overhear. I usually walk in the gutter to bring my height down"
39585,"a bit."

39585,"A good raconteur himself, he does not willingly suffer a story from"
39585,"another. The varmint on occasion finishes your joke off for you, which"
39585,"is his delicate way of intimating that he has heard it before. He is a"
39585,"first-class mimic, and sends every one into a thousand fits while he"
39585,"gives you in succession the Mayor and all the Corporation. He also"
39585,"delights me at times by mimicking me. His mind is receptive rather than"
39585,"creative: it picks up all sorts of gaudy ideas by the wayside like a"
39585,"magpie, and I sometimes enjoy the exquisite sensation of hearing some of"
39585,"these petty pilferings (which he has filched from me) laid at my feet as"
39585,"if they were his own. The ideas which are his own are always"

39585,"Went to bed late last night so I slept on soundly till 9 a.m. Went down"
39585,"to the bath-room, but found the door was shut, so went back to my"
39585,"bedroom again, lay down and dosed a while, thinking of nothing in"
39585,"particular. Went down again--door still locked--swore--returned once"
39585,"more to my room and reclined on the bed, with door open, so that I could"
39585,"hear as soon as the bath-room door opened.... Rang the bell, and"
39585,"Miss ---- brought up a jug of hot water to shave with, and a tumbler of hot"
39585,"water to drink (for my dyspepsia). She, on being interrogated, said"
39585,"there was some one in the bath-room. I said I wanted a bath too, so as"
39585,"she passed on her way down she shouted, ""Hurry up, Mr. Barbellion wants"
39585,"a bath as well."" Her footsteps then died away as she descended lower"

39585,"At length, hearing the door open, I ejaculated, ""the Lord be praised,"""
39585,"rushed down, entered the bath-room and secured it from further"

39585,"and that the bath, tho' empty, was covered inside with patches of soap"
39585,"--unutterably black! Oh! Miss ----!"

39585,"In the afternoon, took a 'bus to Richmond. No room outside, so had to go"
39585,"inside--curse--and sit opposite a row--curse again--of fat, ugly,"
39585,"elderly women, all off to visit their married daughters, the usual"
39585,"Sunday jaunt. At Hammersmith got on the outside, and at Turnham Green"
39585,"was caught in a hail storm. Very cold all of a sudden, so got off and"
39585,"took shelter in the doorway of a shop, which was of course closed, the"
39585,"day being Sunday. Rain, wind, and hail continued for some while, as I"
39585,"gazed at the wet, almost empty street, thinking, re-thinking and"
39585,"thinking over again the same thought, viz., that the 'bus ride along"
39585,"this route was exceptionally cheap--probably because of competition with"
39585,"the trams."

39585,"The next 'bus took me to Richmond. Two young girls sat in front, and"

39585,"Walked in the Park just conscious of the singing of Larks and the"
39585,"chatter of Jays, but harassed mentally by the question, ""To whom shall I"
39585,"send my essay, when finished?"" To shelter from the rain sat under an oak"
39585,"where four youths joined me and said, ""Worse luck,"" and ""Not half,"" and"
39585,"smoked cigarettes. They gossipped and giggled like girls, put their arms"
39585,"around each other's necks. At the dinner last night, they said, they had"
39585,"Duck and Tomato Soup and Beeswax (""Beesley, you know, the chap that goes"
39585,"about with Smith a lot"") wore a fancy waistcoat with a dinner jacket."

39585,"On rising to go, one of the two hilarious youths removed my cap and"
39585,"playfully placed it on top of the bowler which his friend was wearing."
39585,""
39585,"""My cap, I think,"" I said sharply, and the young man apologised with a"

39585,"On the 'bus, coming home, thro' streets full of motor traffic and all"
39585,"available space plastered with advertisements that screamed at you, I"
39585,"espied in front three pretty girls, who gave me the ""Glad Eye."" One had"

39585,"At Kew, two Italians came aboard, one of whom went out of his way to sit"
39585,"among the girls. He sat level with them, and kept turning his head"
39585,"around, giving them a sweeping glance as he did so, to shout remarks in"
39585,"Italian to his friend behind. He thought the girls were prostitutes, I"
39585,"think, and he may have been right. I was on the seat behind this man and"
39585,"for want of anything better to do, studied his face minutely. In short,"
39585,"it was fat, round, and greasy. He wore black moustachios with curly"
39585,"ends, his eyes were dark shining, bulgy, and around his neck was wrapped"
39585,"a scarf inside a dirty linen collar, as if he had a sore throat. I sat"
39585,"behind him and hated him steadily, perseveringly."
39585,""
39585,"At Hammersmith the three girls got off, and the bulgy-eyed Italian"
39585,"watched them go with lascivious eyes, looking over the rail and down at"
39585,"them on the pavement--still interested. I looked down too. They crossed"
39585,"the road in front of us and disappeared."

39585,"myself reading an account of the Lincoln Handicap and a column article"
39585,"on Kleptomania, while advertisements of new books were devoured with"

39585,"story; meanwhile, I, tired of wiping and blowing my nose, sat in the"
39585,"dirty armchair hunched up with elbows on knees and let it drip on to the"
39585,"dirty carpet. B----, of course, noticed nothing, which was fortunate."

39585,"self-consciousness, which make him as charming as a child. Moreover, he"
39585,"often makes me a present of invaluable turf tips. Of course, he is a"
39585,"liar, but his lies are harmless and on his mouth like milk on an"
39585,"infant's. My own lies are much more dangerous. And when you are ill, to"

39585,"The Hon. ----, son and heir of Lord ----, to-day invited me to lunch"
39585,"with him in ---- Square. He's a handsome youth of twenty-five, with fair"
39585,"hair and blue eyes.... and O! such an aristocrat. Good Lord."
39585,""
39585,"But to continue: the receipt of so unexpected an invitation from so"
39585,"glorious a young gentleman at first gave me palpitation of the heart. I"
39585,"was so surprised that I scarcely had enough presence of mind to listen"
39585,"to the rest of his remarks and later, it was only with the greatest"
39585,"difficulty that I could recall the place where we arranged to meet. His"
39585,"remarks, too, are not easy to follow, as he talks in a stenographic,"
39585,"Alfred-Jingle-like manner, jerking out disjected members of sentences,"
39585,"and leaving you to make the best of them or else to Hell with you--by"
39585,"the Lord, I speak English, don't I? If I said, ""I beg your pardon,"" he"
39585,"jerked again, and left me often equally unenlightened."
39585,""
39585,"On arriving at his home, the first thing he did was to shout down the"
39585,"stairs to the basement: ""Elsie, Elsie,"" while I gazed with awe at a"
39585,"parcel on the hall table addressed to ""Lord ----."" Before lunch we sat"
39585,"in his little room and talked about ----, but I was still quite unable"
39585,"to regain my self-composure. I couldn't for the life of me forget that"
39585,"here was I lunching with Lord ----'s son, on equal terms, with mutual"
39585,"interests, that his sisters perhaps would come in directly or even the"
39585,"noble Lord himself. I felt like a scared hare. How should I address a"
39585,"peer of the realm? I kept trying to remember and every now and then for"
39585,"some unaccountable reason my mind travelled into ----shire and I saw"
39585,"Auntie C---- serving out tea and sugar over the counter of the baker's"
39585,"shop in the little village. I luxuriated in the contrast, tho' I am not"
39585,"at all inclined to be a snob."
39585,""
39585,"He next offered me a cigarette, which I took and lit. It was a Turkish"
39585,"cigarette with one end plugged up with cotton-wool--to absorb the"
39585,"nicotine--a, thing I've never seen before. I was so flurried at the time"
39585,"that I did not notice this and lit the wrong end. With perfect ease and"
39585,"self-possession, the Honourable One pointed out my error to me and told"
39585,"me to throw the cigarette away and have another."

39585,"By this time I had completely lost my nerve. My pride, chagrin,"

39585,"the _wrong_ end? Is there a right and a wrong end?"" Lord ----'s son and"

39585,""
39585,"""That didn't burn very well, did it?"""

39585,"I was bound to confess that it did not, and threw the smoke away under"
39585,"the impression that these wonderful cigarettes with right and wrong ends"
39585,"must be some special brand sold only to aristocrats, and at a great"
39585,"price, and possessing some secret virtue. Once again, handsome Mr. ----"
39585,"drew out his silver cigarette-case, selected a second cigarette for me,"
39585,"and held it towards me between his long delicate fingers, at the same"
39585,"time pointing out the plug at one end and making a few staccato remarks"
39585,"which I could not catch."

39585,"I was still too scared to be in full possession of my faculties, and he"
39585,"apparently was too tired to be explicit to a member of the bourgeoisie,"
39585,"stumbling about his drawing-room. The cotton-wool plug only suggested to"
39585,"me some sort of a plot on the part of a dissolute scion of a noble house"
39585,"to lure me into one of his bad habits, such as smoking opium or taking"
39585,"veronal. I again prepared to light the cigarette at the wrong end."
39585,""
39585,"""Try the other end,"" repeated the young man, smiling blandly. I blushed,"
39585,"and immediately recovered my balance, and even related my knowledge of"
39585,"pipes fitted to carry similar plugs...."

39585,"During lunch (at which we sat alone) after sundry visits to the top of"
39585,"the stairs to shout down to the kitchen, he announced that he thought it"
39585,"wasn't last night's affair after all which was annoying the Cook (he got"
39585,"home late without a latch-key)--it was because he called her ""Cook"""
39585,"instead of Mrs. Austin. He smiled serenely and decided to indulge Mrs."
39585,"A., his indulgent attitude betraying an objectionable satisfaction with"
39585,"the security of his own unassailable social status. There was a trace of"
39585,"gratification at the little compliment secreted in the Cook's annoyance."

39585,"all. He may be a bore--particularly if he sits with his finger tips"
39585,"apposed over a spherical paunch, festooned with a gold chain, and keeps"
39585,"on relating _in extenso_ how once he gummed labels on blacking bottles."
39585,"Often enough he is a smug fellow, yet, truth to tell, we all feel a"
39585,"little interested in him. He is a traveller from an antique land, and we"
39585,"sometimes like to listen to his tales of adventure and all he has come"
39585,"through. He has traversed large territories of human experience, he has"
39585,"met strange folk and lodged in strange caravanserai. Similarly with the"
39585,"man who has come down in the world--the fool, the drunkard, the"
39585,"embezzler--he may bore us with his maudlin sympathy with himself yet his"
39585,"stories hold us. It must be a fine experience within the limits of a"
39585,"single life to traverse the whole keyboard of our social status, whether"
39585,"up or down. I should like to be a peer who grinds a barrel organ or"

39585,"malice--weak points in each other's armour, which previous exchange of"
39585,"confidences makes it easy to find. Neither of us hesitates to make use"

39585,"enchanted bullock. Her vivacity was such that the tip of her nose moved"

39585,"reflecting how ill she was and how necessary to wait first till she was"
39585,"well again. These thoughts passed swiftly, vaguely like wraiths thro' my"
39585,"mind: I was barely conscious of them. Then I recalled the sonnet about"

39585,"A common habit is to underline and memorise short, sharp, witty remarks"

39585,"self-glorification. If the author be famous he begins, ""As ---- says,"
39585,"etc."" If unknown the quotation is quietly purloined. He is always very"
39585,"self-conscious and at the same time very self-possessed and very"

39585,"implicit and, as a rule, blushingly denied, you will mistake my impudent"

39585,"His principal concern of course is to arouse and maintain a reputation"

39585,"""certainly one of my better ones""--but still I remained dumb and the"
39585,"time for explanations went for once and all. Now see what a pretty"

39585,"red-faced sea-faring man in charge of the landing stage strolling up and"
39585,"down his small domain,--chatting, jesting, spitting, and making fast a"

39585,"violently--so it was Pachmann: a dirty greasy looking fellow with long"
39585,"hair of dirty grey colour, reaching down to his shoulders and an ugly"

39585,"shrugging them until his eye caught the music stool, which seemed to"
39585,"fill him with amazement. He stalked it carefully, held out one hand to"

39585,"clasping his hands before him and always gazing at the little stool in"
39585,"mute admiration, his eyes sparkling with pleasure, like Mr. Pickwick's"
39585,"on the discovery of the archeological treasure. He approached once more,"
39585,"bent down and ever so gently moved it about 7/8ths of an inch nearer"
39585,"the piano. He then gave it a final pat with his right hand and sat down."
39585,""

39585,"At the close we all crowded around the platform and gave the queer,"

39585,"As an encore he gave us a Valse--""Valse, Valse,"" he exclaimed"

39585,"the platform; on his left the seat holders of the Orchestra Stalls,"
39585,"while at the piano bobbed this grubby little fat man playing divine"
39585,"Chopin divinely well, at the same time rising and falling in his seat,"

39585,"believe me excepting out of charity. It will never be discovered whether"
39585,"what I am going to state is not simply despairing bombast. My few"
39585,"intimate friends and relatives are entirely innocent of science, not to"
39585,"say zoology, and all they realise is the significant fact that I am"
39585,"prone to go extravagant lengths in conversation. But you may take it or"
39585,"leave it: I was the ablest junior on the staff and one of the ablest"
39585,"zoologists in the place--but my ability was always muffled by the"
39585,"inferior work they gave me to do. My last memoir published last December"
39585,"was the best of its kind in treatment, method and technique that ever"
39585,"issued from the institution--I do not say the most important. It was"
39585,"trivial--my work always was trivial because they put me in a mouldy"
39585,"department where all the work was trivial and the methods used as"
39585,"primitive, slipshod and easy as those of Fabricius, the idea being that"
39585,"as I had enjoyed no academic career I was unsuited to fill other posts"
39585,"then vacant--one, work on the Cœlenterates and another on _Vermes_,"
39585,"both rarely favoured by amateurs and requiring laboratory training."
39585,"Later, I had the mortification of seeing these posts filled by men whose"

39585,"Meanwhile, I who had been dissecting for dear life up and down the whole"
39585,"Animal Kingdom in a poorly equipped attic laboratory at home, with no"

39585,"My next achievement of any magnitude was the unexpected printing of a"

39585,"other newspaper. This was when I was 19. No proof had been sent me and"
39585,"no intimation of its acceptance. Moreover, there were two ugly printer's"
39585,"errors. I at once wrote off to correct them in the next issue. My letter"
39585,"was neither published nor acknowledged. I submitted, but presently wrote"
39585,"again, politely hinting that my cheque was overdue. But--screams of"
39585,"silence, and I thought it wise not to complain in view of future"
39585,"printing favours. I soon discovered that the journal had changed hands"
39585,"and was probably on its last legs at the time of my success. As soon as"
39585,"it grew financially sound again no more of my stories were accepted."
39585,""
39585,"A more recent affair I had with the American _Forum,_ which delighted me"
39585,"by publishing my article, but did not pay--tho' the Editor went out of"
39585,"his way to write that ""payment was on publication."" I did not venture to"
39585,"remonstrate as I had another article on the stocks which they also"
39585,"printed without paying me. In spite of uniform failure, my literary"
39585,"ambition has never flagged.[2] I have for years past received my"
39585,"rejected MSS. back from every conceivable kind of periodical, from"
39585,"_Punch_ to the _Hibbert Journal_. At one time I used to file their"
39585,"rejection forms and meditated writing a facetious essay on them. But I"
39585,"decided they were too monotonously similar. My custom was when the"
39585,"ordinary avenues to literary fame had failed me--the half-crown Reviews"
39585,"and the sixpenny Weeklies--to seek out at a library some obscure"
39585,"publication--a Parish Magazine or the local paper--anything was grabbed"
39585,"as a last chance. On one of these occasions I discovered the"
39585,"_Westminster Review_ and immediately plied them with a manuscript and"
39585,"the usual polite note. After six weeks, having no reply, I wrote again"
39585,"and waited for another six weeks. My second remonstrance met with a"
39585,"similar fate, so I went into the city to interview the publishers, and"
39585,"to demand my manuscript back. The manager was out, and I was asked to"
39585,"call again. After waiting about for some time, I left my card, took my"
39585,"departure and decided I would write. The same evening I told the"
39585,"publishers that the anonymous editor would neither print my article nor"
39585,"return it. Would they kindly give me his name and address so that I"
39585,"could write personally. After some delay they replied that although it"
39585,"was not the custom to disclose the editor's name, the following address"
39585,"would find her. She was a lady living in Richmond Row, Shepherd's Bush."
39585,"I wrote to her at once and received no answer. Meanwhile, I had observed"
39585,"that no further issues of the review had appeared on the bookstalls, and"
39585,"the book-sellers were unable to give me any information. I wrote again"
39585,"to the address--this time a playful and facetious letter in which I said"
39585,"I did not propose to take the matter into court, but if it would save"
39585,"her any trouble I would call for the MS. as I lived only a few minutes'"
39585,"walk distant. I received no answer. I was busy at the time and kept"
39585,"putting off executing my firm purpose of visiting the good lady until"
39585,"one evening as I was casually reading the _Star_ coming home in the"
39585,"'bus, I read an account of how some charitably disposed woman had"
39585,"recently visited the Hammersmith Workhouse and removed to her own home a"
39585,"poor soul who was once the friend of George Eliot, George Henry Lewes,"
39585,"and other well-known literary persons of the sixties and had, until it"
