42078,"PREFACE."
42078,""
42078,""
42078,"THE recent cult for Miss Austen, which has resulted in no less than ten"
42078,"new editions of her novels within a decade and three memoirs by"
42078,"different hands within as many years, have made the facts of her life"
42078,"familiar to most readers. It was a short life, and an uneventful one as"
42078,"viewed from the standpoint of our modern times, when steam and"
42078,"electricity have linked together the ends of the earth, and the very air"
42078,"seems teeming with news, agitations, discussions. We have barely time to"
42078,"recover our breath between post and post; and the morning paper with its"
42078,"statements of disaster and its hints of still greater evils to be, is"
42078,"scarcely out-lived, when, lo! in comes the evening issue, contradicting"
42078,"the news of the morning, to be sure, but full of omens and auguries of"
42078,"its own to strew our pillows with the seed of wakefulness."
42078,""
42078,"To us, publications come hot and hot from the press. Telegraphic wires"
42078,"like the intricate and incalculable zigzags of the lightning ramify"
42078,"above our heads; and who can tell at what moment their darts may"
42078,"strike? In Miss Austen's day the tranquil, drowsy, decorous English day"
42078,"of a century since, all was different. News travelled then from hand to"
42078,"hand, carried in creaking post-wagons, or in cases of extreme urgency by"
42078,"men on horseback. When a gentleman journeying in his own ""chaise"" took"
42078,"three days in going from Exeter to London, a distance now covered in"
42078,"three hours of railroad, there was little chance of frequent surprises."
42078,"Love, sorrow, and death were in the world then as now, and worked their"
42078,"will upon the sons of men; but people did not expect happenings every"
42078,"day or even every year. No doubt they lived the longer for this"
42078,"exemption from excitement, and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome"
42078,"repair; but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so"
42078,"little did not stir them deeply."
42078,""
42078,"Miss Austen's life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of"
42078,"history,--the American struggle for independence, and the French"
42078,"Revolution; but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters."
42078,"She was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her"
42078,"brothers were in the navy and had promotion and prize-money to look"
42078,"forward to. In this connection she mentions Trafalgar and the Egyptian"
42078,"expedition, and generously remarks that she would read Southey's ""Life"
42078,"of Nelson"" if there was anything in it about her brother Frank! She"
42078,"honors Sir John Moore by remarking after his death that his mother"
42078,"would perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still"
42078,"alive; further than that, the making of the gooseberry jam and a good"
42078,"recipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and"
42078,"countermarchings, the manoeuvres and diplomacies, going on the world"
42078,"over. In the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope, triumph and"
42078,"defeat, while the fate of Britain and British liberty hung trembling in"
42078,"the balance, she sits writing her letters, trimming her caps, and"
42078,"discussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion"
42078,"wonderful to contemplate. ""The society of rural England in those days,"""
42078,"as Mr. Goldwin Smith happily puts it, ""enjoyed a calm of its own in the"
42078,"midst of the European tempest like the windless centre of a circular"
42078,"storm."""
42078,""
42078,"The point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be"
42078,"circumscribed and narrow; and in this Miss Austen's charm consists."
42078,"Seeing little, she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a"
42078,"dexterity and perfection unequalled. ""On her was bestowed, though in a"
42078,"humble form, the gift which had been bestowed on Homer, Shakespeare,"
42078,"Cervantes, Scott, and a few others,--the gift of creative power."""
42078,"Endowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of"
42078,"humor, she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she"
42078,"understood, giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and"
42078,"value. The things she did not see she did not attempt. Affectation was"
42078,"impossible to her,--most of all, affectation of knowledge or feeling not"
42078,"justly her own. ""She held the mirror up to her time"" with an exquisite"
42078,"sincerity and fidelity; and the closeness of her study brought her"
42078,"intimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature."
42078,"This is the reason why, for all their skimp skirts, leg-of-mutton"
42078,"sleeves, and bygone impossible bonnets, her characters do not seem to us"
42078,"old-fashioned. Minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same"
42078,"pattern from century to century; and given a modern dress and speech,"
42078,"Emma or Elizabeth or dear Anne Eliot could enter a drawing-room to-day,"
42078,"and excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom"
42078,"they would find there."
42078,""
42078,"""Miss Austen's novels are dateless things,"" Mr. Augustine Birrell tells"
42078,"us. ""Nobody in his senses would speak of them as 'old novels.' 'John"
42078,"Inglesant' is an old novel, so is 'Ginx's Baby.' But Emma is quite new,"
42078,"and, like a wise woman, affords few clues to her age."""
42078,""
42078,"We allude with a special touch of affection to Anne Eliot. ""Persuasion,"""
42078,"which was written during the last two years of Miss Austen's life, when"
42078,"the refining touch of Eternity was already upon her, has always seemed"
42078,"to us the most perfect of her novels; and Anne, with her exquisite"
42078,"breeding and unselfish straightforwardness, just touched with the tender"
42078,"reserve of memory and regret, one of her best portraitures. But this is"
42078,"a matter of individual taste. Doubtless Elizabeth Bennet is ""better fun"""
42078,"as the modern girl would say. Miss Austen herself preferred her. She had"
42078,"a droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how"
42078,"real they were to her own mind, and made them equally real to other"
42078,"people. In 1813 she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of Jane"
42078,"Bennet at an exhibition."
42078,""
42078,"      ""I was very well pleased (pray tell Fanny) with a"
42078,"      small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her."
42078,"      I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there"
42078,"      was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps I may find her in the great"
42078,"      exhibition, which we shall go to if we have time. Mrs."
42078,"      Bingley's is exactly like herself,--size, shaped face,"
42078,"      features and sweetness; there never was a greater"
42078,"      likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green"
42078,"      ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always"
42078,"      supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I"
42078,"      dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow."""
42078,""
42078,"And later:--"
42078,""
42078,"      ""We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J."
42078,"      Reynolds'; and I am disappointed, for there was"
42078,"      nothing like Mrs. D. at either. I can only imagine"
42078,"      that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too much to like"
42078,"      it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine"
42078,"      he would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of"
42078,"      love, pride, and delicacy."""
42078,""
42078,"The letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the"
42078,"collection in two volumes published in 1884 by her great-nephew Lord"
42078,"Brabourne. The lightness, almost friskiness, of their tone cannot fail"
42078,"to strike the reader. Modern letters written by women are filled more or"
42078,"less with hints and queries; questionings as to the why and the"
42078,"wherefore occur; allusions to the various ""fads"" of the day, literary or"
42078,"artistic,--Ibsen, Tolstoi, Browning, Esoteric Buddhism, Wagner's Music,"
42078,"the Mind Cure, Social Science, Causes and Reforms. But Cowper and Crabbe"
42078,"were the poetical sensations in Miss Austen's time, Scott and Byron its"
42078,"phenomenal novelties; it took months to get most books printed, and"
42078,"years to persuade anybody to read them. Furthermore the letters, in all"
42078,"probability, are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial"
42078,"side of their writer. There are wide gaps of omission, covering"
42078,"important events such as Mr. Austen's death, the long illness through"
42078,"which Jane nursed her brother Henry, and the anxieties and worries which"
42078,"his failure in business caused to the whole family. What is vouchsafed"
42078,"us is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of Miss Austen's"
42078,"life; and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one. We are glad to have"
42078,"it, in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting"
42078,"part of her personality is withheld from us."
42078,""
42078,"A good daughter, a delightful sister, the most perfect of aunts, what"
42078,"better record could there be of a single woman? Her literary work never"
42078,"stood in the way of her home duties, any more than her ""quiet, limpid,"
42078,"unimpassioned style"" stood between her thought and her readers."
42078,""
42078,"Her fame may justly be said to be almost entirely posthumous. She was"
42078,"read and praised to a moderate degree during her lifetime, but all her"
42078,"novels together brought her no more than seven hundred pounds; and her"
42078,"reputation, as it were, was in its close-sheathed bud when, at the early"
42078,"age of forty-one, she died. It would have excited in her an amused"
42078,"incredulity, no doubt, had any one predicted that two generations after"
42078,"her death the real recognition of her powers was to come. Time, which"
42078,"like desert sands has effaced the footprints of so many promising"
42078,"authors, has, with her, served as the desert wind, to blow aside those"
42078,"dusts of the commonplace which for a while concealed her true"
42078,"proportions. She is loved more than she ever hoped to be, and far more"
42078,"widely known. Mrs. Ritchie tells somewhere an anecdote of a party of"
42078,"seven assembled at a dinner-table, where the question arose of the"
42078,"locality of one of Miss Austen's places,--Maple Grove, the residence of"
42078,"Mr. Suckling, if we are not mistaken,--and six of the persons present at"
42078,"once recognized the allusion, and had a formed opinion on the subject."
42078,"The seventh was a Frenchman who did not read English!"
42078,""
42078,"Scott, Macaulay, Sir James Mackintosh, Miss Martineau, Mrs. Ritchie,"
42078,"Miss Mitford, and a host of others have vied in their generous tributes"
42078,"of admiration. But most striking of all, to our thinking, is that paid"
42078,"to Miss Austen by Lord Tennyson when, in some visit to Lyme not many"
42078,"years since, those with him pointed out this and the other feature of"
42078,"the place only to be interrupted with--""Never mind all that. Show me the"
42078,"exact spot where Louisa Musgrove fell!"" Could non-historical"
42078,"verisimilitude go farther or mean more?"

42078,"I HAVE just received yours and Mary's letter, and I thank you both,"
42078,"though their contents might have been more agreeable. I do not at all"
42078,"expect to see you on Tuesday, since matters have fallen out so"
42078,"unpleasantly; and if you are not able to return till after that day, it"
42078,"will hardly be possible for us to send for you before Saturday, though"
42078,"for my own part I care so little about the ball that it would be no"
42078,"sacrifice to me to give it up for the sake of seeing you two days"
42078,"earlier. We are extremely sorry for poor Eliza's illness. I trust,"
42078,"however, that she has continued to recover since you wrote, and that you"
42078,"will none of you be the worse for your attendance on her. What a"
42078,"good-for-nothing fellow Charles is to bespeak the stockings! I hope he"
42078,"will be too hot all the rest of his life for it!"
42078,""
42078,"I sent you a letter yesterday to Ibthorp, which I suppose you will not"
42078,"receive at Kintbury. It was not very long or very witty, and therefore"
42078,"if you never receive it, it does not much signify. I wrote principally"
42078,"to tell you that the Coopers were arrived and in good health. The little"
42078,"boy is very like Dr. Cooper, and the little girl is to resemble Jane,"
42078,"they say."
42078,""
42078,"Our party to Ashe to-morrow night will consist of Edward Cooper, James"
42078,"(for a ball is nothing without him), Buller, who is now staying with us,"
42078,"and I. I look forward with great impatience to it, as I rather expect to"
42078,"receive an offer from my friend in the course of the evening. I shall"
42078,"refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat."
42078,""
42078,"I am very much flattered by your commendation of my last letter, for I"

42078,"Edward is gone to spend the day with his friend, John Lyford, and does"
42078,"not return till to-morrow. Anna is now here; she came up in her chaise"
42078,"to spend the day with her young cousins, but she does not much take to"
42078,"them or to anything about them, except Caroline's spinning-wheel. I am"
42078,"very glad to find from Mary that Mr. and Mrs. Fowle are pleased with"

42078,"How impertinent you are to write to me about Tom, as if I had not"
42078,"opportunities of hearing from him myself! The last letter that I"
42078,"received from him was dated on Friday, 8th, and he told me that if the"
42078,"wind should be favorable on Sunday, which it proved to be, they were to"
42078,"sail from Falmouth on that day. By this time, therefore, they are at"
42078,"Barbadoes, I suppose. The Rivers are still at Manydown, and are to be at"
42078,"Ashe to-morrow. I intended to call on the Miss Biggs yesterday had the"
42078,"weather been tolerable. Caroline, Anna, and I have just been devouring"
42078,"some cold souse, and it would be difficult to say which enjoyed it most."

42078,"which C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I mean to confine myself in"
42078,"future to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care sixpence. Assure her"
42078,"also, as a last and indubitable proof of Warren's indifference to me,"

42078,"_We_ were at a ball on Saturday, I assure you. We dined at Goodnestone,"
42078,"and in the evening danced two country-dances and the Boulangeries. I"
42078,"opened the ball with Edward Bridges; the other couples were Lewis Cage"
42078,"and Harriet, Frank and Louisa, Fanny and George. Elizabeth played one"
42078,"country-dance, Lady Bridges the other, which she made Henry dance with"
42078,"her, and Miss Finch played the Boulangeries."
42078,""
42078,"In reading over the last three or four lines, I am aware of my having"
42078,"expressed myself in so doubtful a manner that if I did not tell you to"
42078,"the contrary, you might imagine it was Lady Bridges who made Henry dance"
42078,"with her at the same time that she was playing, which, if not"
42078,"impossible, must appear a very improbable event to you. But it was"
42078,"Elizabeth who danced. We supped there, and walked home at night under"
42078,"the shade of two umbrellas."
42078,""
42078,"To-day the Goodnestone party begins to disperse and spread itself"
42078,"abroad. Mr. and Mrs. Cage and George repair to Hythe. Lady Waltham, Miss"
42078,"Bridges, and Miss Mary Finch to Dover, for the health of the two former."
42078,"I have never seen Marianne at all. On Thursday Mr. and Mrs. Bridges"
42078,"return to Danbury; Miss Harriet Hales accompanies them to London on her"
42078,"way to Dorsetshire."

42078,"Farmer Claringbould died this morning, and I fancy Edward means to get"
42078,"some of his farm, if he can cheat Sir Brook enough in the agreement."

42078,"We have just got some venison from Godmersham, which the two Mr. Harveys"
42078,"are to dine on to-morrow, and on Friday or Saturday the Goodnestone"
42078,"people are to finish their scraps. Henry went away on Friday, as he"
42078,"purposed, _without fayl_. You will hear from him soon, I imagine, as he"
42078,"talked of writing to Steventon shortly. Mr. Richard Harvey is going to"
42078,"be married; but as it is a great secret, and only known to half the"
42078,"neighborhood, you must not mention it. The lady's name is Musgrave."
42078,""
42078,"I am in great distress. I cannot determine whether I shall give Richis"
42078,"half a guinea or only five shillings when I go away. Counsel me, amiable"
42078,"Miss Austen, and tell me which will be the most."
42078,""
42078,"We walked Frank last night to Crixhall Ruff, and he appeared much"
42078,"edified. Little Edward was breeched yesterday for good and all, and was"
42078,"whipped into the bargain."

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--We have been very gay since I wrote last; dining at"
42078,"Nackington, returning by moonlight, and everything quite in style, not"
42078,"to mention Mr. Claringbould's funeral which we saw go by on Sunday. I"
42078,"believe I told you in a former letter that Edward had some idea of"
42078,"taking the name of Claringbould; but that scheme is over, though it"
42078,"would be a very eligible as well as a very pleasant plan, would any one"
42078,"advance him money enough to begin on. We rather expected Mr. Milles to"
42078,"have done so on Tuesday; but to our great surprise nothing was said on"
42078,"the subject, and unless it is in your power to assist your brother with"
42078,"five or six hundred pounds, he must entirely give up the idea."
42078,""
42078,"At Nackington we met Lady Sondes' picture over the mantelpiece in the"
42078,"dining-room, and the pictures of her three children in an ante-room,"
42078,"besides Mr. Scott, Miss Fletcher, Mr. Toke, Mr. J. Toke, and the"
42078,"archdeacon Lynch. Miss Fletcher and I were very thick, but I am the"
42078,"thinnest of the two. She wore her purple muslin, which is pretty"
42078,"enough, though it does not become her complexion. There are two traits"
42078,"in her character which are pleasing,--namely, she admires Camilla, and"
42078,"drinks no cream in her tea. If you should ever see Lucy, you may tell"
42078,"her that I scolded Miss Fletcher for her negligence in writing, as she"
42078,"desired me to do, but without being able to bring her to any proper"
42078,"sense of shame,--that Miss Fletcher says, in her defence, that as"
42078,"everybody whom Lucy knew when she was in Canterbury has now left it, she"
42078,"has nothing at all to write to her about. By _everybody_, I suppose Miss"
42078,"Fletcher means that a new set of officers have arrived there. But this"
42078,"is a note of my own."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Milles, Mr. John Toke, and in short everybody of any sensibility"
42078,"inquired in tender strains after you, and I took an opportunity of"
42078,"assuring Mr. J. T. that neither he nor his father need longer keep"
42078,"themselves single for you."
42078,""
42078,"We went in our two carriages to Nackington; but how we divided I shall"
42078,"leave you to surmise, merely observing that as Elizabeth and I were"
42078,"without either hat or bonnet, it would not have been very convenient for"
42078,"us to go in the chaise. We went by Bifrons, and I contemplated with a"
42078,"melancholy pleasure the abode of him on whom I once fondly doated. We"
42078,"dine to-day at Goodnestone, to meet my aunt Fielding from Margate and a"
42078,"Mr. Clayton, her professed admirer--at least, so I imagine. Lady Bridges"
42078,"has received very good accounts of Marianne, who is already certainly"
42078,"the better for her bathing."
42078,""
42078,"So His Royal Highness Sir Thomas Williams has at length sailed; the"
42078,"papers say ""on a cruise."" But I hope they are gone to Cork, or I shall"
42078,"have written in vain. Give my love to Jane, as she arrived at Steventon"
42078,"yesterday, I dare say."
42078,""
42078,"I sent a message to Mr. Digweed from Edward in a letter to Mary Lloyd"
42078,"which she ought to receive to-day; but as I know that the Harwoods are"
42078,"not very exact as to their letters, I may as well repeat it to you. Mr."
42078,"Digweed is to be informed that illness has prevented Seward's coming"
42078,"over to look at the repairs intended at the farm, but that he will come"
42078,"as soon as he can. Mr. Digweed may also be informed, if you think"
42078,"proper, that Mr. and Mrs. Milles are to dine here to-morrow, and that"
42078,"Mrs. Joan Knatchbull is to be asked to meet them. Mr. Richard Harvey's"
42078,"match is put off till he has got a better Christian name, of which he"
42078,"has great hopes."
42078,""
42078,"Mr. Children's two sons are both going to be married, John and George."
42078,"They are to have one wife between them, a Miss Holwell, who belongs to"
42078,"the Black Hole at Calcutta. I depend on hearing from James very soon; he"
42078,"promised me an account of the ball, and by this time he must have"
42078,"collected his ideas enough after the fatigue of dancing to give me one."
42078,""
42078,"Edward and Fly went out yesterday very early in a couple of shooting"
42078,"jackets, and came home like a couple of bad shots, for they killed"
42078,"nothing at all. They are out again to-day, and are not yet returned."
42078,"Delightful sport! They are just come home, Edward with his two brace,"
42078,"Frank with his two and a half. What amiable young men!"
42078,""
42078,"_Friday._--Your letter and one from Henry are just come, and the"
42078,"contents of both accord with my scheme more than I had dared expect. In"
42078,"one particular I could wish it otherwise, for Henry is very indifferent"
42078,"indeed. You must not expect us quite so early, however, as Wednesday,"
42078,"the 20th,--on that day se'nnight, according to our present plan, we may"
42078,"be with you. Frank had never any idea of going away before Monday, the"
42078,"26th. I shall write to Miss Mason immediately, and press her returning"
42078,"with us, which Henry thinks very likely, and particularly eligible."
42078,""
42078,"Buy Mary Harrison's gown by all means. You shall have mine for ever so"
42078,"much money, though, if I am tolerably rich when I get home, I shall like"
42078,"it very much myself."
42078,""
42078,"As to the mode of our travelling to town, _I_ want to go in a"
42078,"stage-coach, but Frank will not let me. As you are likely to have the"
42078,"Williams and Lloyds with you next week, you would hardly find room for"
42078,"us then. If any one wants anything in town, they must send their"
42078,"commissions to Frank, as _I_ shall merely pass through it. The"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--This morning has been spent in doubt and"
42078,"deliberation, in forming plans and removing difficulties, for it ushered"
42078,"in the day with an event which I had not intended should take place so"
42078,"soon by a week. Frank has received his appointment on board the ""Captain"
42078,"John Gore,"" commanded by the ""Triton,"" and will therefore be obliged to"
42078,"be in town on Wednesday; and though I have every disposition in the"
42078,"world to accompany him on that day, I cannot go on the uncertainty of"
42078,"the Pearsons being at home, as I should not have a place to go to in"
42078,"case they were from home."
42078,""
42078,"I wrote to Miss P. on Friday, and hoped to receive an answer from her"
42078,"this morning, which would have rendered everything smooth and easy, and"
42078,"would have enabled us to leave this place to-morrow, as Frank, on first"
42078,"receiving his appointment, intended to do. He remains till Wednesday"
42078,"merely to accommodate me. I have written to her again to-day, and"
42078,"desired her to answer it by return of post. On Tuesday, therefore, I"
42078,"shall positively know whether they can receive me on Wednesday. If they"
42078,"cannot, Edward has been so good as to promise to take me to Greenwich on"
42078,"the Monday following, which was the day before fixed on, if that suits"
42078,"them better. If I have no answer at all on Tuesday, I must suppose Mary"
42078,"is not at home, and must wait till I do hear, as after having invited"
42078,"her to go to Steventon with me, it will not quite do to go home and say"
42078,"no more about it."
42078,""
42078,"My father will be so good as to fetch home his prodigal daughter from"
42078,"town, I hope, unless he wishes me to walk the hospitals, enter at the"
42078,"Temple, or mount guard at St. James'. It will hardly be in Frank's power"
42078,"to take me home,--nay, it certainly will not. I shall write again as"
42078,"soon as I get to Greenwich."
42078,""
42078,"What dreadful hot weather we have! It keeps one in a continual state of"
42078,"inelegance."
42078,""
42078,"If Miss Pearson should return with me, pray be careful not to expect too"
42078,"much beauty. I will not pretend to say that on a first view she quite"
42078,"answered the opinion I had formed of her. My mother, I am sure, will be"
42078,"disappointed if she does not take great care. From what I remember of"
42078,"her picture, it is no great resemblance."
42078,""
42078,"I am very glad that the idea of returning with Frank occurred to me; for"
42078,"as to Henry's coming into Kent again, the time of its taking place is so"
42078,"very uncertain that I should be waiting for dead men's shoes. I had once"
42078,"determined to go with Frank to-morrow and take my chance, etc., but they"
42078,"dissuaded me from so rash a step as I really think on consideration it"
42078,"would have been; for if the Pearsons were not at home, I should"
42078,"inevitably fall a sacrifice to the arts of some fat woman who would make"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You have already heard from Daniel, I conclude, in"
42078,"what excellent time we reached and quitted Sittingbourne, and how very"
42078,"well my mother bore her journey thither. I am now able to send you a"
42078,"continuation of the same good account of her. She was very little"
42078,"fatigued on her arrival at this place, has been refreshed by a"
42078,"comfortable dinner, and now seems quite stout. It wanted five minutes of"
42078,"twelve when we left Sittingbourne, from whence we had a famous pair of"
42078,"horses, which took us to Rochester in an hour and a quarter; the postboy"
42078,"seemed determined to show my mother that Kentish drivers were not always"
42078,"tedious, and really drove as fast as Cax."
42078,""
42078,"Our next stage was not quite so expeditiously performed; the road was"
42078,"heavy, and our horses very indifferent. However, we were in such good"
42078,"time and my mother bore her journey so well, that expedition was of"
42078,"little importance to us; and as it was, we were very little more than"
42078,"two hours and a half coming hither, and it was scarcely past four when"
42078,"we stopped at the inn. My mother took some of her bitters at Ospringe,"
42078,"and some more at Rochester, and she ate some bread several times."
42078,""
42078,"We have got apartments up two pair of stairs, as we could not be"
42078,"otherwise accommodated with a sitting-room and bed-chambers on the same"
42078,"floor which we wished to be. We have one double-bedded and one"
42078,"single-bedded room; in the former my mother and I are to sleep. I shall"
42078,"leave you to guess who is to occupy the other. We sate down to dinner a"
42078,"little after five, and had some beef-steaks and a boiled fowl, but no"
42078,"oyster sauce."
42078,""
42078,"I should have begun my letter soon after our arrival, but for a little"
42078,"adventure which prevented me. After we had been here a quarter of an"
42078,"hour it was discovered that my writing and dressing boxes had been by"
42078,"accident put into a chaise which was just packing off as we came in, and"
42078,"were driven away toward Gravesend in their way to the West Indies. No"
42078,"part of my property could have been such a prize before, for in my"
42078,"writing-box was all my worldly wealth, 7_l._, and my dear Harry's"
42078,"deputation. Mr. Nottley immediately despatched a man and horse after the"
42078,"chaise, and in half an hour's time I had the pleasure of being as rich"
42078,"as ever; they were got about two or three miles off."
42078,""
42078,"My day's journey has been pleasanter in every respect than I expected. I"
42078,"have been very little crowded and by no means unhappy. Your"
42078,"watchfulness with regard to the weather on our accounts was very kind"
42078,"and very effectual. We had one heavy shower on leaving Sittingbourne,"
42078,"but afterwards the clouds cleared away, and we had a very bright"
42078,"_chrystal_ afternoon."
42078,""
42078,"My father is now reading the ""Midnight Bell,"" which he has got from the"
42078,"library, and mother sitting by the fire. Our route to-morrow is not"
42078,"determined. We have none of us much inclination for London, and if Mr."
42078,"Nottley will give us leave, I think we shall go to Staines through"
42078,"Croydon and Kingston, which will be much pleasanter than any other way;"

42078,"We arrived here yesterday between four and five, but I cannot send you"

42078,"first and second. Soon after I had finished my letter from Staines, my"
42078,"mother began to suffer from the exercise or fatigue of travelling, and"
42078,"she was a good deal indisposed. She had not a very good night at"
42078,"Staines, but bore her journey better than I had expected, and at"
42078,"Basingstoke, where we stopped more than half an hour, received much"
42078,"comfort from a mess of broth and the sight of Mr. Lyford, who"
42078,"recommended her to take twelve drops of laudanum when she went to bed as"
42078,"a composer, which she accordingly did."
42078,""
42078,"James called on us just as we were going to tea, and my mother was well"
42078,"enough to talk very cheerfully to him before she went to bed. James"
42078,"seems to have taken to his old trick of coming to Steventon in spite of"
42078,"Mary's reproaches, for he was here before breakfast and is now paying us"
42078,"a second visit. They were to have dined here to-day, but the weather is"
42078,"too bad. I have had the pleasure of hearing that Martha is with them."
42078,"James fetched her from Ibthorp on Thursday, and she will stay with them"
42078,"till she removes to Kintbury."
42078,""
42078,"We met with no adventures at all in our journey yesterday, except that"
42078,"our trunk had once nearly slipped off, and we were obliged to stop at"
42078,"Hartley to have our wheels greased."
42078,""
42078,"Whilst my mother and Mr. Lyford were together I went to Mrs. Ryder's and"
42078,"bought what I intended to buy, but not in much perfection. There were"
42078,"no narrow braces for children, and scarcely any notting silk; but Miss"
42078,"Wood, as usual, is going to town very soon, and will lay in a fresh"
42078,"stock. I gave 2_s._ 3_d._ a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it is not"
42078,"very good, but it is so disgraceful and contemptible an article in"
42078,"itself that its being comparatively good or bad is of little importance."
42078,"I bought some Japan ink likewise, and next week shall begin my"
42078,"operations on my hat, on which you know my principal hopes of happiness"

42078,"soon. My attachment to him will be more durable. I shall think with"

42078,"were very glad to see us Nanny was, I am sure. She confesses that it"
42078,"was very dull, and yet she had her child with her till last Sunday. I"
42078,"understand that there are some grapes left, but I believe not many; they"
42078,"must be gathered as soon as possible, or this rain will entirely rot"
42078,"them."

42078,"I am quite angry with myself for not writing closer; why is my alphabet"

42078,"few days ago. How unfortunate for both of us that he came so soon! Dame"
42078,"Bushell washes for us only one week more, as Sukey has got a place. John"
42078,"Steevens' wife undertakes our purification. She does not look as if"
42078,"anything she touched would ever be clean, but who knows? We do not seem"
42078,"likely to have any other maidservant at present, but Dame Staples will"
42078,"supply the place of one. Mary has hired a young girl from Ashe who has"
42078,"never been out to service to be her scrub, but James fears her not being"
42078,"strong enough for the place."

42078,"and his family then told him that they would receive his wife, if she"
42078,"continued to behave well for another year. He was very grateful, as well"
42078,"he might; their behavior throughout the whole affair has been"
42078,"particularly kind. Earle and his wife live in the most private manner"
42078,"imaginable at Portsmouth, without keeping a servant of any kind. What a"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am so good as to write to you again thus speedily,"
42078,"to let you know that I have just heard from Frank. He was at Cadiz,"
42078,"alive and well, on October 19, and had then very lately received a"
42078,"letter from you, written as long ago as when the ""London"" was at St."
42078,"Helen's. But his _raly_ latest intelligence of us was in one from me of"
42078,"September 1, which I sent soon after we got to Godmersham. He had"
42078,"written a packet full for his dearest friends in England, early in"
42078,"October, to go by the ""Excellent;"" but the ""Excellent"" was not sailed,"
42078,"nor likely to sail, when he despatched this to me. It comprehended"
42078,"letters for both of us, for Lord Spencer, Mr. Daysh, and the East India"
42078,"Directors. Lord St. Vincent had left the fleet when he wrote, and was"
42078,"gone to Gibraltar, it was said to superintend the fitting out of a"
42078,"private expedition from thence against some of the enemies' ports;"
42078,"Minorca or Malta were conjectured to be the objects."
42078,""
42078,"Frank writes in good spirits, but says that our correspondence cannot be"
42078,"so easily carried on in future as it has been, as the communication"
42078,"between Cadiz and Lisbon is less frequent than formerly. You and my"
42078,"mother, therefore, must not alarm yourselves at the long intervals that"
42078,"may divide his letters. I address this advice to you two as being the"
42078,"most tender-hearted of the family."
42078,""
42078,"My mother made her _entree_ into the dressing-room through crowds of"
42078,"admiring spectators yesterday afternoon, and we all drank tea together"
42078,"for the first time these five weeks. She has had a tolerable night, and"
42078,"bids fair for a continuance in the same brilliant course of action"
42078,"to-day. . . ."
42078,""
42078,"Mr. Lyford was here yesterday; he came while we were at dinner, and"
42078,"partook of our elegant entertainment. I was not ashamed at asking him to"
42078,"sit down to table, for we had some pease-soup, a sparerib, and a"
42078,"pudding. He wants my mother to look yellow and to throw out a rash, but"
42078,"she will do neither."
42078,""
42078,"I was at Deane yesterday morning. Mary was very well, but does not gain"
42078,"bodily strength very fast. When I saw her so stout on the third and"
42078,"sixth days, I expected to have seen her as well as ever by the end of a"
42078,"fortnight."

42078,"James went to Ibthorp yesterday to see his mother and child. Letty is"
42078,"with Mary[3] at present, of course exceedingly happy, and in raptures"
42078,"with the child. Mary does not manage matters in such a way as to make me"
42078,"want to lay in myself. She is not tidy enough in her appearance; she has"
42078,"no dressing-gown to sit up in; her curtains are all too thin, and"
42078,"things are not in that comfort and style about her which are necessary"
42078,"to make such a situation an enviable one. Elizabeth was really a pretty"
42078,"object with her nice clean cap put on so tidily and her dress so"
42078,"uniformly white and orderly. We live entirely in the dressing-room now,"
42078,"which I like very much; I always feel so much more elegant in it than in"
42078,"the parlor."
42078,""
42078,"No news from Kintbury yet. Eliza sports with our impatience. She was"
42078,"very well last Thursday. Who is Miss Maria Montresor going to marry, and"
42078,"what is to become of Miss Mulcaster?"
42078,""
42078,"I find great comfort in my stuff gown, but I hope you do not wear yours"
42078,"too often. I have made myself two or three caps to wear of evenings"
42078,"since I came home, and they save me a world of torment as to"
42078,"hairdressing, which at present gives me no trouble beyond washing and"
42078,"brushing, for my long hair is always plaited up out of sight, and my"
42078,"short hair curls well enough to want no papering. I have had it cut"
42078,"lately by Mr. Butler."
42078,""
42078,"There is no reason to suppose that Miss Morgan is dead after all. Mr."
42078,"Lyford gratified us very much yesterday by his praises of my father's"
42078,"mutton, which they all think the finest that was ever ate. John Bond"
42078,"begins to find himself grow old, which John Bonds ought not to do, and"
42078,"unequal to much hard work; a man is therefore hired to supply his place"
42078,"as to labor, and John himself is to have the care of the sheep. There"
42078,"are not more people engaged than before, I believe; only men instead of"
42078,"boys. I fancy so at least, but you know my stupidity as to such matters."
42078,"Lizzie Bond is just apprenticed to Miss Small, so we may hope to see her"
42078,"able to spoil gowns in a few years."
42078,""
42078,"My father has applied to Mr. May for an ale-house for Robert, at his"
42078,"request, and to Mr. Deane, of Winchester, likewise. This was my mother's"
42078,"idea, who thought he would be proud to oblige a relation of Edward in"
42078,"return for Edward's accepting his money. He sent a very civil answer"
42078,"indeed, but has no house vacant at present. May expects to have an empty"

42078,"being without a maid so long, that we are determined to like her, and"
42078,"she will find it a hard matter to displease us. As yet, she seems to"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter came quite as soon as I expected, and so"

42078,"It is a great satisfaction to us to hear that your business is in a way"

42078,"possible. You are very welcome to my father's name and to his services"
42078,"if they are ever required in it. I shall keep my ten pounds too, to wrap"

42078,"I took the liberty a few days ago of asking your black velvet bonnet to"
42078,"lend me its cawl, which it very readily did, and by which I have been"
42078,"enabled to give a considerable improvement of dignity to cap, which was"
42078,"before too _nidgetty_ to please me. I shall wear it on Thursday, but I"
42078,"hope you will not be offended with me for following your advice as to"
42078,"its ornaments only in part. I still venture to retain the narrow silver"
42078,"round it, put twice round without any bow, and instead of the black"
42078,"military feather shall put in the coquelicot one as being smarter, and"
42078,"besides coquelicot is to be all the fashion this winter. After the ball"
42078,"I shall probably make it entirely black."

42078,"I am sorry that our dear Charles begins to feel the dignity of"
42078,"ill-usage. My father will write to Admiral Gambier. He must have already"
42078,"received so much satisfaction from his acquaintance and patronage of"
42078,"Frank, that he will be delighted, I dare say, to have another of the"
42078,"family introduced to him. I think it would be very right in Charles to"
42078,"address Sir Thomas on the occasion, though I cannot approve of your"
42078,"scheme of writing to him (which you communicated to me a few nights ago)"
42078,"to request him to come home and convey you to Steventon. To do you"

42078,"I am very much obliged to my dear little George for his message,--for"

42078,""
42078,"Admiral Gambier, in reply to my father's application, writes as follows:"
42078,"""As it is usual to keep young officers in small vessels, it being most"
42078,"proper on account of their inexperience, and it being also a situation"
42078,"where they are more in the way of learning their duty, your son has been"
42078,"continued in the 'Scorpion;' but I have mentioned to the Board of"
42078,"Admiralty his wish to be in a frigate, and when a proper opportunity"
42078,"offers and it is judged that he has taken his turn in a small ship, I"
42078,"hope he will be removed. With regard to your son now in the 'London' I"
42078,"am glad I can give you the assurance that his promotion is likely to"
42078,"take place very soon, as Lord Spencer has been so good as to say he"

42078,"There! I may now finish my letter and go and hang myself, for I am sure"

42078,"after this. _Now_ I really think he will soon be made, and only wish we"
42078,"could communicate our foreknowledge of the event to him whom it"
42078,"principally concerns. My father has written to Daysh to desire that he"
42078,"will inform us, if he can, when the commission is sent. Your chief wish"

42078,"I have sent the same extract of the sweets of Gambier to Charles, who,"
42078,"poor fellow, though he sinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the"
42078,"hero of the piece, will, I hope, be contented with the prospect held out"
42078,"to him. By what the Admiral says, it appears as if he had been"

42078,"I returned from Manydown this morning, and found my mother certainly in"

42078,"pleasantly with Catherine. Miss Blackford is agreeable enough. I do not"
42078,"want people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking"
42078,"them a great deal. I found only Catherine and her when I got to Manydown"
42078,"on Thursday. We dined together, and went together to Worting to seek the"

42078,"Our ball was very thin, but by no means unpleasant. There were"

42078,"some idea from the list of my partners,--Mr. Wood, G. Lefroy, Rice, a"
42078,"Mr. Butcher (belonging to the Temples, a sailor and not of the 11th"
42078,"Light Dragoons), Mr. Temple (not the horrid one of all), Mr. Wm. Orde"
42078,"(cousin to the Kingsclere man), Mr. John Harwood, and Mr. Calland, who"
42078,"appeared as usual with his hat in his hand, and stood every now and then"
42078,"behind Catherine and me to be talked to and abused for not dancing. We"
42078,"teased him, however, into it at last. I was very glad to see him again"

42078,"flirt of the evening. He inquired after you."
42078,""
42078,"There were twenty dances, and I danced them all, and without any"
42078,"fatigue. I was glad to find myself capable of dancing so much, and with"
42078,"so much satisfaction as I did; from my slender enjoyment of the Ashford"
42078,"balls (as assemblies for dancing) I had not thought myself equal to it,"
42078,"but in cold weather and with few couples I fancy I could just as well"
42078,"dance for a week together as for half an hour. My black cap was openly"

42078,"he will soon be restored to that blessing likewise. If his nervous"
42078,"complaint proceeded from a suppression of something that ought to be"
42078,"thrown out, which does not seem unlikely, the first of these disorders"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You must read your letters over _five_ times in"
42078,"future before you send them, and then, perhaps, you may find them as"
42078,"entertaining as I do. I laughed at several parts of the one which I am"
42078,"now answering."
42078,""
42078,"Charles is not come yet, but he must come this morning, or he shall"
42078,"never know what I will do to him. The ball at Kempshott is this evening,"
42078,"and I have got him an invitation, though I have not been so considerate"
42078,"as to get him a partner. But the cases are different between him and"
42078,"Eliza Bailey, for he is not in a dying way, and may therefore be equal"
42078,"to getting a partner for himself. I believe I told you that Monday was"
42078,"to be the ball night, for which, and for all other errors into which I"
42078,"may ever have led you, I humbly ask your pardon."
42078,""
42078,"Elizabeth is very cruel about my writing music, and, as a punishment for"
42078,"her, I should insist upon always writing out all hers for her in future,"
42078,"if I were not punishing myself at the same time."
42078,""
42078,"I am tolerably glad to hear that Edward's income is so good a one,--as"
42078,"glad as I can be at anybody's being rich except you and me,--and I am"
42078,"thoroughly rejoiced to hear of his present to you."
42078,""
42078,"I am not to wear my white satin cap to-night, after all; I am to wear a"
42078,"mamalone cap instead, which Charles Fowle sent to Mary, and which she"
42078,"lends me. It is all the fashion now; worn at the opera, and by Lady"
42078,"Mildmays at Hackwood balls. I hate describing such things, and I dare"
42078,"say you will be able to guess what it is like. I have got over the"
42078,"dreadful epocha of mantua-making much better than I expected. My gown is"
42078,"made very much like my blue one, which you always told me sat very well,"
42078,"with only these variations: the sleeves are short, the wrap fuller, the"
42078,"apron comes over it, and a band of the same completes the whole."

42078,""
42078,"_Wednesday._--I have had a cold and weakness in one of my eyes for some"
42078,"days, which makes writing neither very pleasant nor very profitable, and"
42078,"which will probably prevent my finishing this letter myself. My mother"
42078,"has undertaken to do it for me, and I shall leave the Kempshott ball for"
42078,"her."

42078,"You express so little anxiety about my being murdered under Ash Park"

42078,"you whether I was or not, and shall only say that I did not return home"
42078,"that night or the next, as Martha kindly made room for me in her bed,"
42078,"which was the shut-up one in the new nursery. Nurse and the child slept"
42078,"upon the floor, and there we all were in some confusion and great"
42078,"comfort. The bed did exceedingly well for us, both to lie awake in and"
42078,"talk till two o'clock, and to sleep in the rest of the night. I love"
42078,"Martha better than ever, and I mean to go and see her, if I can, when"
42078,"she gets home. We all dined at the Harwoods' on Thursday, and the party"
42078,"broke up the next morning."
42078,""
42078,"This complaint in my eye has been a sad bore to me, for I have not been"
42078,"able to read or work in any comfort since Friday; but one advantage"
42078,"will be derived from it, for I shall be such a proficient in music by"
42078,"the time I have got rid of my cold, that I shall be perfectly qualified"
42078,"in that science at least to take Mr. Roope's office at Eastwell next"
42078,"summer; and I am sure of Elizabeth's recommendation, be it only on"
42078,"Harriet's account. Of my talent in drawing I have given specimens in my"
42078,"letters to you, and I have nothing to do but to invent a few hard names"
42078,"for the stars."
42078,""
42078,"Mary grows rather more reasonable about her child's beauty, and says"
42078,"that she does not think him really handsome; but I suspect her"
42078,"moderation to be something like that of W---- W----'s mamma. Perhaps"
42078,"Mary has told you that they are going to enter more into dinner-parties;"
42078,"the Biggs and Mr. Holder dine there to-morrow, and I am to meet them. I"
42078,"shall sleep there. Catherine has the honor of giving her name to a set,"
42078,"which will be composed of two Withers, two Heathcotes, a Blackford, and"
42078,"no Bigg except herself. She congratulated me last night on Frank's"
42078,"promotion, as if she really felt the joy she talked of."
42078,""
42078,"My sweet little George! I am delighted to hear that he has such an"
42078,"inventive genius as to face-making. I admired his yellow wafer very"
42078,"much, and hope he will choose the wafer for your next letter. I wore my"
42078,"green shoes last night, and took my white fan with me; I am very glad he"
42078,"never threw it into the river."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Knight giving up the Godmersham estate to Edward was no such"
42078,"prodigious act of generosity after all, it seems, for she has reserved"
42078,"herself an income out of it still; this ought to be known, that her"
42078,"conduct may not be overrated. I rather think Edward shows the most"
42078,"magnanimity of the two, in accepting her resignation with such"
42078,"incumbrances."

42078,"The more I write, the better my eye gets; so I shall at least keep on"
42078,"till it is quite well, before I give up my pen to my mother."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Bramston's little movable apartment was tolerably filled last night"
42078,"by herself, Mrs. H. Blackstone, her two daughters, and me. I do not like"
42078,"the Miss Blackstones; indeed, I was always determined not to like them,"
42078,"so there is the less merit in it. Mrs. Bramston was very civil, kind,"
42078,"and noisy. I spent a very pleasant evening, chiefly among the Manydown"
42078,"party. There was the same kind of supper as last year, and the same want"
42078,"of chairs. There were more dancers than the room could conveniently"
42078,"hold, which is enough to constitute a good ball at any time."
42078,""
42078,"I do not think I was very much in request. People were rather apt not to"
42078,"ask me till they could not help it; one's consequence, you know, varies"
42078,"so much at times without any particular reason. There was one gentleman,"
42078,"an officer of the Cheshire, a very good-looking young man, who, I was"
42078,"told, wanted very much to be introduced to me; but as he did not want"
42078,"it quite enough to take much trouble in effecting it, we never could"
42078,"bring it about."
42078,""
42078,"I danced with Mr. John Wood again, twice with a Mr. South, a lad from"
42078,"Winchester, who, I suppose, is as far from being related to the bishop"
42078,"of that diocese as it is possible to be, with G. Lefroy, and J. Harwood,"
42078,"who, I think, takes to me rather more than he used to do. One of my"
42078,"gayest actions was sitting down two dances in preference to having Lord"
42078,"Bolton's eldest son for my partner, who danced too ill to be endured."
42078,"The Miss Charterises were there, and played the parts of the Miss Edens"
42078,"with great spirit. Charles never came. Naughty Charles! I suppose he"
42078,"could not get superseded in time."
42078,""
42078,"Miss Debary has replaced your two sheets of drawing-paper with two of"
42078,"superior size and quality; so I do not grudge her having taken them at"

42078,"is Mrs. Skeete of Basingstoke, and Mr. French, chemist, of Reading."
42078,""
42078,"I do not wonder at your wanting to read ""First Impressions"" again, so"
42078,"seldom as you have gone through it, and that so long ago. I am much"
42078,"obliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you. I have"
42078,"long secretly wished it might be done, but had not courage to make the"
42078,"request."
42078,""
42078,"Pray mention the name of Maria Montresor's lover when you write next. My"
42078,"mother wants to know it, and I have not courage to look back into your"

42078,""
42078,"I shall not be able to send this till to-morrow, and you will be"

42078,"The partnership between Jeffereys, Toomer, and Legge is dissolved; the"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I will endeavor to make this letter more worthy your"
42078,"acceptance than my last, which was so shabby a one that I think Mr."
42078,"Marshall could never charge you with the postage. My eyes have been"
42078,"very indifferent since it was written, but are now getting better once"
42078,"more; keeping them so many hours open on Thursday night, as well as the"
42078,"dust of the ballroom, injured them a good deal. I use them as little as"
42078,"I can, but you know, and Elizabeth knows, and everybody who ever had"

42078,"going to the westward. Charles does not approve of this at all, and will"
42078,"not be much grieved if he should be too late for her before she sails,"
42078,"as he may then hope to get into a better station. He attempted to go to"
42078,"town last night, and got as far on his road thither as Dean Gate; but"
42078,"both the coaches were full, and we had the pleasure of seeing him back"
42078,"again. He will call on Daysh to-morrow to know whether the ""Tamar"" has"
42078,"sailed or not, and if she is still at the Downs he will proceed in one"
42078,"of the night coaches to Deal. I want to go with him, that I may explain"
42078,"the country to him properly between Canterbury and Rowling, but the"
42078,"unpleasantness of returning by myself deters me. I should like to go as"
42078,"far as Ospringe with him very much indeed, that I might surprise you at"

42078,""
42078,"Martha writes me word that Charles was very much admired at Kintbury,"
42078,"and Mrs. Lefroy never saw any one so much improved in her life, and"

42078,"Yesterday came a letter to my mother from Edward Cooper to announce, not"
42078,"the birth of a child, but of a living; for Mrs. Leigh has begged his"
42078,"acceptance of the Rectory of Hamstall-Ridware in Staffordshire, vacant"
42078,"by Mr. Johnson's death. We collect from his letter that he means to"
42078,"reside there, in which he shows his wisdom. Staffordshire is a good way"
42078,"off; so we shall see nothing more of them till, some fifteen years"
42078,"hence, the Miss Coopers are presented to us, fine, jolly, handsome,"
42078,"ignorant girls. The living is valued at 140_l._ a year, but perhaps it"
42078,"may be improvable. How will they be able to convey the furniture of the"
42078,"dressing-room so far in safety?"
42078,""
42078,"Our first cousins seem all dropping off very fast. One is incorporated"
42078,"into the family, another dies, and a third goes into Staffordshire. We"
42078,"can learn nothing of the disposal of the other living. I have not the"
42078,"smallest notion of Fulwar's having it. Lord Craven has probably other"
42078,"connections and more intimate ones, in that line, than he now has with"
42078,"the Kintbury family."
42078,""
42078,"Our ball on Thursday was a very poor one, only eight couple and but"
42078,"twenty-three people in the room; but it was not the ball's fault, for we"
42078,"were deprived of two or three families by the sudden illness of Mr."
42078,"Wither, who was seized that morning at Winchester with a return of his"
42078,"former alarming complaint. An express was sent off from thence to the"
42078,"family; Catherine and Miss Blackford were dining with Mrs. Russell. Poor"
42078,"Catherine's distress must have been very great. She was prevailed on to"
42078,"wait till the Heathcotes could come from Wintney, and then with those"
42078,"two and Harris proceeded directly to Winchester. In such a disorder his"
42078,"danger, I suppose, must always be great; but from this attack he is now"
42078,"rapidly recovering, and will be well enough to return to Manydown, I"
42078,"fancy, in a few days."
42078,""
42078,"It was a fine thing for conversation at the ball. But it deprived us not"
42078,"only of the Biggs, but of Mrs. Russell too, and of the Boltons and John"
42078,"Harwood, who were dining there likewise, and of Mr. Lane, who kept away"
42078,"as related to the family. Poor man!--I mean Mr. Wither--his life is so"

42078,"Our ball was chiefly made up of Jervoises and Terrys, the former of whom"

42078,"Lyford, and Mr. Briggs, a friend of the latter. I had a very pleasant"
42078,"evening, however, though you will probably find out that there was no"
42078,"particular reason for it; but I do not think it worth while to wait for"
42078,"enjoyment until there is some real opportunity for it. Mary behaved very"

42078,"guessed so much stranger things. She is tolerably well,--better upon the"
42078,"whole than she was some weeks ago. She would tell you herself that she"

42078,"ride of it from Devizes, for it has rained almost all the way, and our"
42078,"first view of Bath has been just as gloomy as it was last November"
42078,"twelvemonth."
42078,""
42078,"I have got so many things to say, so many things equally important, that"
42078,"I know not on which to decide at present, and shall therefore go and eat"
42078,"with the children."
42078,""
42078,"We stopped in Paragon as we came along, but as it was too wet and dirty"
42078,"for us to get out, we could only see Frank, who told us that his master"
42078,"was very indifferent, but had had a better night last night than usual."
42078,"In Paragon we met Mrs. Foley and Mrs. Dowdeswell with her yellow shawl"
42078,"airing out, and at the bottom of Kingsdown Hill we met a gentleman in a"
42078,"buggy, who, on minute examination, turned out to be Dr. Hall--and Dr."
42078,"Hall in such very deep mourning that either his mother, his wife, or"
42078,"himself must be dead. These are all of our acquaintance who have yet met"
42078,"our eyes."
42078,""
42078,"I have some hopes of being plagued about my trunk; I had more a few"
42078,"hours ago, for it was too heavy to go by the coach which brought Thomas"
42078,"and Rebecca from Devizes; there was reason to suppose that it might be"
42078,"too heavy likewise for any other coach, and for a long time we could"
42078,"hear of no wagon to convey it. At last, however, we unluckily discovered"
42078,"that one was just on the point of setting out for this place, but at any"
42078,"rate the trunk cannot be here till to-morrow; so far we are safe, and"
42078,"who knows what may not happen to procure a further delay?"
42078,""
42078,"I put Mary's letter into the post-office at Andover with my own hand."
42078,""
42078,"We are exceedingly pleased with the house; the rooms are quite as large"
42078,"as we expected. Mrs. Bromley is a fat woman in mourning, and a little"
42078,"black kitten runs about the staircase. Elizabeth has the apartment"
42078,"within the drawing-room; she wanted my mother to have it, but as there"
42078,"was no bed in the inner one, and the stairs are so much easier of"
42078,"ascent, or my mother so much stronger than in Paragon as not to regard"
42078,"the double flight, it is settled for us to be above, where we have two"
42078,"very nice-sized rooms, with dirty quilts and everything comfortable. I"
42078,"have the outward and larger apartment, as I ought to have; which is"
42078,"quite as large as our bedroom at home, and my mother's is not materially"
42078,"less. The beds are both as large as any at Steventon, and I have a very"
42078,"nice chest of drawers and a closet full of shelves,--so full indeed that"
42078,"there is nothing else in it, and it should therefore be called a"
42078,"cupboard rather than a closet, I suppose."
42078,""
42078,"Tell Mary that there were some carpenters at work in the inn at Devizes"
42078,"this morning, but as I could not be sure of their being Mrs. W. Fowle's"
42078,"relations, I did not make myself known to them."
42078,""
42078,"I hope it will be a tolerable afternoon. When first we came, all the"
42078,"umbrellas were up, but now the pavements are getting very white again."
42078,""
42078,"My mother does not seem at all the worse for her journey, nor are any of"
42078,"us, I hope, though Edward seemed rather fagged last night, and not very"
42078,"brisk this morning; but I trust the bustle of sending for tea, coffee,"
42078,"and sugar, etc., and going out to taste a cheese himself, will do him"
42078,"good."
42078,""
42078,"There was a very long list of arrivals here in the newspaper yesterday,"
42078,"so that we need not immediately dread absolute solitude; and there is a"
42078,"public breakfast in Sydney Gardens every morning, so that we shall not"
42078,"be wholly starved."
42078,""
42078,"Elizabeth has just had a very good account of the three little boys. I"
42078,"hope you are very busy and very comfortable. I find no difficulty in"
42078,"closing my eyes. I like our situation very much; it is far more cheerful"
42078,"than Paragon, and the prospect from the drawing-room window, at which I"
42078,"now write, is rather picturesque, as it commands a prospective view of"
42078,"the left side of Brock Street, broken by three Lombardy poplars in the"
42078,"garden of the last house in Queen's Parade."

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am obliged to you for two letters, one from"
42078,"yourself and the other from Mary, for of the latter I knew nothing till"
42078,"on the receipt of yours yesterday, when the pigeon-basket was examined,"
42078,"and I received my due. As I have written to her since the time which"
42078,"ought to have brought me hers, I suppose she will consider herself, as I"
42078,"choose to consider her, still in my debt."
42078,""
42078,"I will lay out all the little judgment I have in endeavoring to get such"
42078,"stockings for Anna as she will approve; but I do not know that I shall"

42078,"and, at any rate, they shall all have flat heels."
42078,""
42078,"What must I tell you of Edward? Truth or falsehood? I will try the"
42078,"former, and you may choose for yourself another time. He was better"
42078,"yesterday than he had been for two or three days before,--about as well"
42078,"as while he was at Steventon. He drinks at the Hetling Pump, is to bathe"
42078,"to-morrow, and try electricity on Tuesday. He proposed the latter"
42078,"himself to Dr. Fellowes, who made no objection to it, but I fancy we are"
42078,"all unanimous in expecting no advantage from it. At present I have no"
42078,"great notion of our staying here beyond the month."
42078,""
42078,"I heard from Charles last week; they were to sail on Wednesday."
42078,""
42078,"My mother seems remarkably well. My uncle overwalked himself at first,"
42078,"and can now only travel in a chair, but is otherwise very well."
42078,""
42078,"My cloak is come home. I like it very much, and can now exclaim with"
42078,"delight, like J. Bond at hay-harvest, ""This is what I have been looking"
42078,"for these three years."" I saw some gauzes in a shop in Bath Street"
42078,"yesterday at only 4_d._ a yard, but they were not so good or so pretty"
42078,"as mine. Flowers are very much worn, and fruit is still more the thing."
42078,"Elizabeth has a bunch of strawberries, and I have seen grapes, cherries,"
42078,"plums, and apricots. There are likewise almonds and raisins, French"
42078,"plums, and tamarinds at the grocers', but I have never seen any of them"
42078,"in hats. A plum or greengage would cost three shillings; cherries and"
42078,"grapes about five, I believe, but this is at some of the dearest shops."
42078,"My aunt has told me of a very cheap one, near Walcot Church, to which I"
42078,"shall go in quest of something for you. I have never seen an old woman"
42078,"at the pump-room."
42078,""
42078,"Elizabeth has given me a hat, and it is not only a pretty hat, but a"
42078,"pretty style of hat too. It is something like Eliza's, only, instead of"
42078,"being all straw, half of it is narrow purple ribbon. I flatter myself,"
42078,"however, that you can understand very little of it from this"
42078,"description. Heaven forbid that I should ever offer such encouragement"
42078,"to explanations as to give a clear one on any occasion myself! But I"
42078,"must write no more of this. . . ."
42078,""
42078,"I spent Friday evening with the Mapletons, and was obliged to submit to"
42078,"being pleased in spite of my inclination. We took a very charming walk"
42078,"from six to eight up Beacon Hill, and across some fields, to the village"
42078,"of Charlecombe, which is sweetly situated in a little green valley, as a"
42078,"village with such a name ought to be. Marianne is sensible and"
42078,"intelligent; and even Jane, considering how fair she is, is not"
42078,"unpleasant. We had a Miss North and a Mr. Gould of our party; the latter"
42078,"walked home with me after tea. He is a very young man, just entered"
42078,"Oxford, wears spectacles, and has heard that ""Evelina"" was written by"
42078,"Dr. Johnson."

42078,"I am afraid I cannot undertake to carry Martha's shoes home, for, though"

42078,"There is to be a grand gala on Tuesday evening in Sydney Gardens, a"
42078,"concert, with illuminations and fireworks. To the latter Elizabeth and I"

42078,"its usual charm for me, as the gardens are large enough for me to get"
42078,"pretty well beyond the reach of its sound. In the morning Lady"
42078,"Willoughby is to present the colors to some corps, or Yeomanry, or"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter yesterday made me very happy. I am"
42078,"heartily glad that you have escaped any share in the impurities of"
42078,"Deane, and not sorry, as it turns out, that our stay here has been"
42078,"lengthened. I feel tolerably secure of our getting away next week,"
42078,"though it is certainly possible that we may remain till Thursday the"
42078,"27th. I wonder what we shall do with all our intended visits this"
42078,"summer! I should like to make a compromise with Adlestrop, Harden, and"
42078,"Bookham, that Martha's spending the summer at Steventon should be"
42078,"considered as our respective visits to them all."
42078,""
42078,"Edward has been pretty well for this last week, and as the waters have"
42078,"never disagreed with him in any respect, we are inclined to hope that he"
42078,"will derive advantage from them in the end. Everybody encourages us in"
42078,"this expectation, for they all say that the effect of the waters cannot"
42078,"be negative, and many are the instances in which their benefit is felt"
42078,"afterwards more than on the spot. He is more comfortable here than I"
42078,"thought he would be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will both, I"
42078,"believe, be very glad to get away--the latter especially, which one"
42078,"can't wonder at somehow. So much for Mrs. Piozzi. I had some thoughts of"
42078,"writing the whole of my letter in her style, but I believe I shall not."
42078,""
42078,"Though you have given me unlimited powers concerning your sprig, I"
42078,"cannot determine what to do about it, and shall therefore in this and in"
42078,"every other future letter continue to ask your further directions. We"
42078,"have been to the cheap shop, and very cheap we found it, but there are"
42078,"only flowers made there, no fruit; and as I could get four or five very"
42078,"pretty sprigs of the former for the same money which would procure only"
42078,"one Orleans plum--in short, could get more for three or four shillings"
42078,"than I could have means of bringing home--I cannot decide on the fruit"
42078,"till I hear from you again. Besides, I cannot help thinking that it is"
42078,"more natural to have flowers grow out of the head than fruit. What do"
42078,"you think on that subject?"
42078,""
42078,"I would not let Martha read ""First Impressions""[4] again upon any"
42078,"account, and am very glad that I did not leave it in your power. She is"
42078,"very cunning, but I saw through her design; she means to publish it from"
42078,"memory, and one more perusal must enable her to do it. As for"
42078,"""Fitzalbini,"" when I get home she shall have it, as soon as ever she"
42078,"will own that Mr. Elliott is handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair men are"

42078,"Benjamin Portal is here. How charming that is! I do not exactly know"
42078,"why, but the phrase followed so naturally that I could not help putting"

42078,"known to him."
42078,""
42078,"I am very glad you liked my lace, and so are you, and so is Martha, and"
42078,"we are all glad together. I have got your cloak home, which is quite"
42078,"delightful,--as delightful at least as half the circumstances which are"
42078,"called so."
42078,""
42078,"I do not know what is the matter with me to-day, but I cannot write"
42078,"quietly; I am always wandering away into some exclamation or other."

42078,"We walked to Weston one evening last week, and liked it very much. Liked"
42078,"what very much? Weston? No, walking to Weston. I have not expressed"

42078,""
42078,"We have not been to any public place lately, nor performed anything out"

42078,"had it not so happened that we did not go."
42078,""
42078,"Edward renewed his acquaintance lately with Mr. Evelyn, who lives in the"
42078,"Queen's Parade, and was invited to a family dinner, which I believe at"
42078,"first Elizabeth was rather sorry at his accepting; but yesterday Mrs."
42078,"Evelyn called on us, and her manners were so pleasing that we liked the"
42078,"idea of going very much. The Biggs would call her a nice woman. But Mr."
42078,"Evelyn, who was indisposed yesterday, is worse to-day, and we are put"

42078,"muslin was thick, dirty, and ragged, and therefore would by no means do"
42078,"for a united gift. I changed it consequently as soon as I could, and,"
42078,"considering what a state my imprudence had reduced me to, I thought"

42078,"tell why, unless the absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience"
42078,"reproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent, was a relief to"
42078,"him. There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was"
42078,"merely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We"
42078,"began at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane before five. There were"
42078,"but fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of"
42078,"the county, and not many more from the other. My partners were the two"
42078,"St. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I"

42078,"only one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,"
42078,"with the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband,"
42078,"and fat neck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains"
42078,"of the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago;"
42078,"the other is refined into a nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine"
42078,"Bigg. I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I"
42078,"looked at his daughter, and thought her a queer animal with a white"
42078,"neck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained to think a very fine young woman,"
42078,"which I much regret. She danced away with great activity. Her husband is"
42078,"ugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so"
42078,"_very_ old. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with"
42078,"brown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of nose. The General has"

42078,""
42078,"My mother looks forward with as much certainty as you can do to our"
42078,"keeping two maids; my father is the only one not in the secret. We plan"
42078,"having a steady cook and a young giddy housemaid, with a sedate,"
42078,"middle-aged man, who is to undertake the double office of husband to the"

42078,"You feel more for John Bond than John Bond deserves. I am sorry to lower"
42078,"his character, but he is not ashamed to own himself that he has no doubt"
42078,"at all of getting a good place, and that he had even an offer many years"
42078,"ago from a Farmer Paine of taking him into his service whenever he might"
42078,"quit my father's."

42078,"There are three parts of Bath which we have thought of as likely to have"
42078,"houses in them,--Westgate Buildings, Charles Street, and some of the"
42078,"short streets leading from Laura Place or Pulteney Street."
42078,""
42078,"Westgate Buildings, though quite in the lower part of the town, are not"
42078,"badly situated themselves. The street is broad, and has rather a good"
42078,"appearance. Charles Street, however, I think is preferable. The"
42078,"buildings are new, and its nearness to Kingsmead Fields would be a"
42078,"pleasant circumstance. Perhaps you may remember, or perhaps you may"
42078,"forget, that Charles Street leads from the Queen Square Chapel to the"
42078,"two Green Park Streets."
42078,""
42078,"The houses in the streets near Laura Place I should expect to be above"
42078,"our price. Gay Street would be too high, except only the lower house on"
42078,"the left-hand side as you ascend. Towards that my mother has no"
42078,"disinclination; it used to be lower rented than any other house in the"
42078,"row, from some inferiority in the apartments. But above all others her"
42078,"wishes are at present fixed on the corner house in Chapel Row, which"
42078,"opens into Prince's Street. Her knowledge of it, however, is confined"
42078,"only to the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being"
42078,"really desirable as of its being to be had. In the mean time she assures"
42078,"you that she will do everything in her power to avoid Trim Street,"
42078,"although you have not expressed the fearful presentiment of it which was"
42078,"rather expected."

42078,"all the old heterogeneous, miscellany, manuscript, Scriptural pieces"
42078,"dispersed over the house, are to be given to James. Your own drawings"
42078,"will not cease to be your own, and the two paintings on tin will be at"
42078,"your disposal. My mother says that the French agricultural prints in"
42078,"the best bedroom were given by Edward to his two sisters. Do you or he"
42078,"know anything about it?"
42078,""
42078,"She has written to my aunt, and we are all impatient for the answer. I"
42078,"do not know how to give up the idea of our both going to Paragon in May."
42078,"Your going I consider as indispensably necessary, and I shall not like"
42078,"being left behind; there is no place here or hereabouts that I shall"
42078,"want to be staying at, and though, to be sure, the keep of two will be"
42078,"more than of one, I will endeavor to make the difference less by"
42078,"disordering my stomach with Bath buns; and as to the trouble of"
42078,"accommodating us, whether there are one or two, it is much the same."
42078,""
42078,"According to the first plan, my mother and our two selves are to travel"
42078,"down together, and my father follow us afterwards in about a fortnight"
42078,"or three weeks. We have promised to spend a couple of days at Ibthorp in"
42078,"our way. We must all meet at Bath, you know, before we set out for the"

42078,"My father and mother, wisely aware of the difficulty of finding in all"

42078,"the beds, indeed, that we shall want are to be removed,--namely, besides"
42078,"theirs, our own two, the best for a spare one, and two for servants; and"
42078,"these necessary articles will probably be the only material ones that"
42078,"it would answer to send down. I do not think it will be worth while to"
42078,"remove any of our chests of drawers; we shall be able to get some of a"
42078,"much more commodious sort, made of deal, and painted to look very neat;"
42078,"and I flatter myself that for little comforts of all kinds our apartment"
42078,"will be one of the most complete things of the sort all over Bath,"
42078,"Bristol included."
42078,""
42078,"We have thought at times of removing the sideboard, or a Pembroke table,"
42078,"or some other piece of furniture, but, upon the whole, it has ended in"
42078,"thinking that the trouble and risk of the removal would be more than the"

42078,"of Exeter or York. Take the whole world through, and he will find many"
42078,"more places at a greater distance from London than Deane than he will at"
42078,"a less. What does he think of Glencoe or Lake Katherine?"
42078,""
42078,"I feel rather indignant that any possible objection should be raised"

42078,"situation!--that Deane should not be universally allowed to be as near"
42078,"the metropolis as any other country villages. As this is the case,"
42078,"however, as Mr. Peter Debary has shown himself a Peter in the blackest"
42078,"sense of the word, we are obliged to look elsewhere for an heir; and my"
42078,"father has thought it a necessary compliment to James Digweed to offer"
42078,"the curacy to him, though without considering it as either a desirable"
42078,"or an eligible situation for him. Unless he is in love with Miss Lyford,"
42078,"I think he had better not be settled exactly in this neighborhood; and"
42078,"unless he is very much in love with her indeed, he is not likely to"

42078,"Kemble. Desirable, however, as the latter circumstance was, I cannot"
42078,"help wondering at its taking place. Why did you dance four dances with"
42078,"so stupid a man? Why not rather dance two of them with some elegant"

42078,"the spring is more advanced and the days longer. He took his paper of"
42078,"appraisement away with him, and therefore we only know the estimate he"
42078,"has made of one or two articles of furniture which my father"
42078,"particularly inquired into. I understand, however, that he was of"

42078,"A few days ago I had a letter from Miss Irvine, and as I was in her"
42078,"debt, you will guess it to be a remonstrance, not a very severe one,"
42078,"however; the first page is in her usual retrospective, jealous,"
42078,"inconsistent style, but the remainder is chatty and harmless. She"
42078,"supposes my silence may have proceeded from resentment of her not having"
42078,"written to inquire particularly after my hooping-cough, etc. She is a"
42078,"funny one."
42078,""
42078,"I have answered her letter, and have endeavored to give something like"
42078,"the truth with as little incivility as I could, by placing my silence to"
42078,"the want of subject in the very quiet way in which we live. Phebe has"
42078,"repented, and stays. I have also written to Charles, and I answered Miss"
42078,"Buller's letter by return of post, as I intended to tell you in my last."
42078,""
42078,"Two or three things I recollected when it was too late, that I might"
42078,"have told you; one is that the Welbys have lost their eldest son by a"
42078,"putrid fever at Eton, and another that Tom Chute is going to settle in"
42078,"Norfolk."

42078,"You have scarcely ever mentioned Lizzy since your being at Godmersham. I"
42078,"hope it is not because she is altered for the worse."

42078,"I cannot yet satisfy Fanny as to Mrs. Foote's baby's name, and I must"
42078,"not encourage her to expect a good one, as Captain Foote is a professed"
42078,"adversary to all but the plainest; he likes only Mary, Elizabeth, Anne,"
42078,"etc. Our best chance is of ""Caroline,"" which in compliment to a sister"

42078,"He dined with us on Friday, and I fear will not soon venture again, for"
42078,"the strength of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton, underdone even"
42078,"for James; and Captain Foote has a particular dislike to underdone"
42078,"mutton; but he was so good-humored and pleasant that I did not much mind"
42078,"his being starved. He gives us all the most cordial invitation to his"
42078,"house in the country, saying just what the Williams ought to say to make"
42078,"us welcome. Of them we have seen nothing since you left us, and we hear"
42078,"that they are just gone to Bath again, to be out of the way of further"
42078,"alterations at Brooklands."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. F. A. has had a very agreeable letter from Mrs. Dickson, who was"
42078,"delighted with the purse, and desires her not to provide herself with a"
42078,"christening dress, which is exactly what her young correspondent wanted;"
42078,"and she means to defer making any of the caps as long as she can, in"
42078,"hope of having Mrs. D.'s present in time to be serviceable as a pattern."
42078,"She desires me to tell you that the gowns were cut out before your"
42078,"letter arrived, but that they are long enough for Caroline. The _Beds_,"
42078,"as I believe they are called, have fallen to Frank's share to continue,"
42078,"and of course are cut out to admiration."

42078,"""Alphonsine"" did not do. We were disgusted in twenty pages, as,"
42078,"independent of a bad translation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a"
42078,"pen hitherto so pure; and we changed it for the ""Female Quixote,"" which"
42078,"now makes our evening amusement; to me a very high one, as I find the"
42078,"work quite equal to what I remembered it. Mrs. F. A., to whom it is new,"
42078,"enjoys it as one could wish; the other Mary, I believe, has little"
42078,"pleasure from that or any other book."
42078,""
42078,"My mother does not seem at all more disappointed than ourselves at the"
42078,"termination of the family treaty; she thinks less of that just now than"
42078,"of the comfortable state of her own finances, which she finds on closing"
42078,"her year's accounts beyond her expectation, as she begins the new year"
42078,"with a balance of 30_l._ in her favor; and when she has written her"
42078,"answer to my aunt, which you know always hangs a little upon her mind,"
42078,"she will be above the world entirely. You will have a great deal of"
42078,"unreserved discourse with Mrs. K., I dare say, upon this subject, as"
42078,"well as upon many other of our family matters. Abuse everybody but me."
42078,""
42078,"_Thursday._--We expected James yesterday, but he did not come; if he"
42078,"comes at all now, his visit will be a very short one, as he must return"
42078,"to-morrow, that Ajax and the chair may be sent to Winchester on"
42078,"Saturday. Caroline's new pelisse depended upon her mother's being able"
42078,"or not to come so far in the chair; how the guinea that will be saved by"
42078,"the same means of return is to be spent I know not. Mrs. J. A. does not"
42078,"talk much of poverty now, though she has no hope of my brother's being"
42078,"able to buy another horse next summer."
42078,""
42078,"Their scheme against Warwickshire continues, but I doubt the family's"
42078,"being at Stoneleigh so early as James says he must go, which is May."
42078,""
42078,"My mother is afraid I have not been explicit enough on the subject of"
42078,"her wealth; she began 1806 with 68_l._ she begins 1807 with 99_l._, and"
42078,"this after 32_l._ purchase of stock. Frank too has been settling his"
42078,"accounts and making calculations, and each party feels quite equal to"
42078,"our present expenses; but much increase of house-rent would not do for"
42078,"either. Frank limits himself, I believe, to four hundred a year."
42078,""
42078,"You will be surprised to hear that Jenny is not yet come back; we have"
42078,"heard nothing of her since her reaching Itchingswell, and can only"
42078,"suppose that she must be detained by illness in somebody or other, and"
42078,"that she has been each day expecting to be able to come on the morrow. I"
42078,"am glad I did not know beforehand that she was to be absent during the"
42078,"whole or almost the whole of our friends being with us, for though the"
42078,"inconvenience has not been nothing, I should have feared still more."
42078,"Our dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only Molly's"
42078,"head and Molly's hands to conduct them; she fries better than she did,"
42078,"but not like Jenny."
42078,""
42078,"We did _not_ take our walk on Friday, it was too dirty, nor have we yet"
42078,"done it; we may perhaps do something like it to-day, as after seeing"
42078,"Frank skate, which he hopes to do in the meadows by the beech, we are to"
42078,"treat ourselves with a passage over the ferry. It is one of the"
42078,"pleasantest frosts I ever knew, so very quiet. I hope it will last some"
42078,"time longer for Frank's sake, who is quite anxious to get some skating;"
42078,"he tried yesterday, but it would not do."
42078,""
42078,"Our acquaintance increase too fast. He was recognized lately by Admiral"
42078,"Bertie, and a few days since arrived the Admiral and his daughter"
42078,"Catherine to wait upon us. There was nothing to like or dislike in"
42078,"either. To the Berties are to be added the Lances, with whose cards we"
42078,"have been endowed, and whose visit Frank and I returned yesterday. They"
42078,"live about a mile and three-quarters from S. to the right of the new"
42078,"road to Portsmouth, and I believe their house is one of those which are"
42078,"to be seen almost anywhere among the woods on the other side of the"
42078,"Itchen. It is a handsome building, stands high, and in a very beautiful"
42078,"situation."
42078,""
42078,"We found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether she boasts any offspring"
42078,"besides a grand pianoforte did not appear. She was civil and chatty"
42078,"enough, and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance in Southampton,"
42078,"which we gratefully declined."
42078,""
42078,"I suppose they must be acting by the orders of Mr. Lance of Netherton in"
42078,"this civility, as there seems no other reason for their coming near us."
42078,"They will not come often, I dare say. They live in a handsome style and"
42078,"are rich, and she seemed to like to be rich, and we gave her to"
42078,"understand that we were far from being so; she will soon feel therefore"
42078,"that we are not worth her acquaintance."

42078,""
42078,". . . OUR garden is putting in order by a man who bears a remarkably"
42078,"good character, has a very fine complexion, and asks something less than"
42078,"the first. The shrubs which border the gravel walk, he says, are only"
42078,"sweetbrier and roses, and the latter of an indifferent sort; we mean to"
42078,"get a few of a better kind, therefore, and at my own particular desire"
42078,"he procures us some syringas. I could not do without a syringa, for the"
42078,"sake of Cowper's line. We talk also of a laburnum. The border under the"
42078,"terrace wall is clearing away to receive currants and gooseberry bushes,"
42078,"and a spot is found very proper for raspberries."
42078,""
42078,"The alterations and improvements within doors, too, advance very"
42078,"properly, and the offices will be made very convenient indeed. Our"
42078,"dressing-table is constructing on the spot, out of a large kitchen table"
42078,"belonging to the house, for doing which we have the permission of Mr."
42078,"Husket, Lord Lansdown's painter,--domestic painter, I should call him,"
42078,"for he lives in the castle. Domestic chaplains have given way to this"
42078,"more necessary office, and I suppose whenever the walls want no touching"
42078,"up he is employed about my lady's face."
42078,""
42078,"The morning was so wet that I was afraid we should not be able to see"
42078,"our little visitor; but Frank, who alone could go to church, called for"
42078,"her after service, and she is now talking away at my side and examining"
42078,"the treasures of my writing-desk drawers,--very happy, I believe. Not at"
42078,"all shy, of course. Her name is Catherine, and her sister's Caroline."
42078,"She is something like her brother, and as short for her age, but not so"
42078,"well-looking."
42078,""
42078,"What is become of all the shyness in the world? Moral as well as natural"
42078,"diseases disappear in the progress of time, and new ones take their"
42078,"place. Shyness and the sweating sickness have given way to confidence"
42078,"and paralytic complaints. . . ."
42078,""
42078,"_Evening._--Our little visitor has just left us, and left us highly"
42078,"pleased with her; she is a nice, natural, open-hearted, affectionate"
42078,"girl, with all the ready civility which one sees in the best children in"
42078,"the present day; so unlike anything that I was myself at her age, that I"
42078,"am often all astonishment and shame. Half her time was spent at"
42078,"spillikins, which I consider as a very valuable part of our household"
42078,"furniture, and as not the least important benefaction from the family of"
42078,"Knight to that of Austen."
42078,""
42078,"But I must tell you a story. Mary has for some time had notice from Mrs."
42078,"Dickson of the intended arrival of a certain Miss Fowler in this place."
42078,"Miss F. is an intimate friend of Mrs. D., and a good deal known as such"
42078,"to Mary. On Thursday last she called here while we were out. Mary"
42078,"found, on our return, her card with only her name on it, and she had"
42078,"left word that she would call again. The particularity of this made us"
42078,"talk, and, among other conjectures, Frank said in joke, ""I dare say she"
42078,"is staying with the Pearsons."" The connection of the names struck Mary,"
42078,"and she immediately recollected Miss Fowler's having been very intimate"
42078,"with persons so called, and, upon putting everything together, we have"
42078,"scarcely a doubt of her being actually staying with the only family in"
42078,"the place whom we cannot visit."
42078,""
42078,"What a _contretemps_! in the language of France. What an unluckiness! in"
42078,"that of Madame Duval. The black gentleman has certainly employed one of"
42078,"his menial imps to bring about this complete, though trifling mischief."
42078,"Miss F. has never called again, but we are in daily expectation of it."
42078,"Miss P. has, of course, given her a proper understanding of the"
42078,"business. It is evident that Miss F. did not expect or wish to have the"
42078,"visit returned, and Frank is quite as much on his guard for his wife as"
42078,"we could desire for her sake or our own."
42078,""
42078,"We shall rejoice in being so near Winchester when Edward belongs to it,"
42078,"and can never have our spare bed filled more to our satisfaction than by"
42078,"him. Does he leave Eltham at Easter?"
42078,""
42078,"We are reading ""Clarentine,"" and are surprised to find how foolish it"
42078,"is. I remember liking it much less on a second reading than at the"
42078,"first, and it does not bear a third at all. It is full of unnatural"
42078,"conduct and forced difficulties, without striking merit of any kind."
42078,""
42078,"Miss Harrison is going into Devonshire, to attend Mrs. Dusantoy, as"
42078,"usual. Miss J. is married to young Mr. G., and is to be very unhappy. He"
42078,"swears, drinks, is cross, jealous, selfish, and brutal. The match makes"
42078,"her family miserable, and has occasioned his being disinherited."
42078,""
42078,"The Browns are added to our list of acquaintance. He commands the Sea"
42078,"Fencibles here, under Sir Thomas, and was introduced at his own desire"
42078,"by the latter when we saw him last week. As yet the gentlemen only have"
42078,"visited, as Mrs. B. is ill; but she is a nice-looking woman, and wears"
42078,"one of the prettiest straw bonnets in the place."
42078,""
42078,"_Monday._--The garret beds are made, and ours will be finished to-day. I"
42078,"had hoped it would be finished on Saturday, but neither Mrs. Hall nor"
42078,"Jenny was able to give help enough for that, and I have as yet done very"
42078,"little, and Mary nothing at all. This week we shall do more, and I"
42078,"should like to have all the five beds completed by the end of it. There"

42078,"I should not be surprised if we were to be visited by James again this"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Where shall I begin? Which of all my important"
42078,"nothings shall I tell you first? At half after seven yesterday morning"
42078,"Henry saw us into our own carriage, and we drove away from the Bath"
42078,"Hotel; which, by the by, had been found most uncomfortable"
42078,"quarters,--very dirty, very noisy, and very ill-provided. James began"
42078,"his journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles were hot;"
42078,"Deptford Hill brought to my mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen"
42078,"years ago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the day"
42078,"advanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford, which we reached within the"
42078,"two hours and three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same inn at"
42078,"which we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the present occasion"
42078,"had about the same bad butter."
42078,""
42078,"At half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling on without any"
42078,"adventure reached Sittingbourne by three. Daniel was watching for us at"
42078,"the door of the George, and I was acknowledged very kindly by Mr. and"
42078,"Mrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted my conversation, while"
42078,"Mary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for"
42078,"Sittingbourne; and so off we drove, drove, drove, and by six o'clock"
42078,"were at Godmersham."
42078,""
42078,"Our two brothers were walking before the house as we approached, as"
42078,"natural as life. Fanny and Lizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of"
42078,"pleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the breakfast-parlor, and"
42078,"then proceeded to our rooms. Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the"
42078,"Yellow room--very literally--for I am writing in it at this moment. It"
42078,"seems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself, and to be at"
42078,"Godmersham without you is also odd."
42078,""
42078,"You are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who came to me as soon as she"
42078,"had seen her Aunt James to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as"
42078,"energetic as usual in her longings for you. She is grown both in height"
42078,"and size since last year, but not immoderately, looks very well, and"
42078,"seems as to conduct and manner just what she was and what one could wish"
42078,"her to continue."
42078,""
42078,"Elizabeth,[5] who was dressing when we arrived, came to me for a minute"
42078,"attended by Marianne, Charles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave"
42078,"me a very affectionate welcome. That I had received such from Edward"
42078,"also I need not mention; but I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I"
42078,"never saw him look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly"
42078,"well. I cannot praise Elizabeth's looks, but they are probably affected"
42078,"by a cold. Her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three"
42078,"years, though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is not quite so"
42078,"lovely as he was. Louisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find"
42078,"handsomer than I expected, though at present disguised by such a violent"
42078,"breaking-out that she does not come down after dinner. She has charming"
42078,"eyes and a nice open countenance, and seems likely to be very lovable."
42078,"Her size is magnificent."
42078,""
42078,"I was agreeably surprised to find Louisa Bridges still here. She looks"
42078,"remarkably well (legacies are very wholesome diet), and is just what she"
42078,"always was. John is at Sandling. You may fancy our dinner-party"
42078,"therefore; Fanny, of course, belonging to it, and little Edward, for"
42078,"that day. He was almost too happy, his happiness at least made him too"
42078,"talkative."
42078,""
42078,"It has struck ten; I must go to breakfast."
42078,""
42078,"Since breakfast I have had a _tete-a-tete_ with Edward in his room; he"
42078,"wanted to know James's plans and mine, and from what his own now are I"
42078,"think it already nearly certain that I shall return when they do, though"
42078,"not with them. Edward will be going about the same time to Alton, where"
42078,"he has business with Mr. Trimmer, and where he means his son should join"
42078,"him; and I shall probably be his companion to that place, and get on"
42078,"afterwards somehow or other."
42078,""
42078,"I should have preferred a rather longer stay here certainly, but there"
42078,"is no prospect of any later conveyance for me, as he does not mean to"
42078,"accompany Edward on his return to Winchester, from a very natural"
42078,"unwillingness to leave Elizabeth at that time. I shall at any rate be"
42078,"glad not to be obliged to be an incumbrance on those who have brought me"
42078,"here, for, as James has no horse, I must feel in their carriage that I"
42078,"am taking his place. We were rather crowded yesterday, though it does"
42078,"not become me to say so, as I and my boa were of the party, and it is"
42078,"not to be supposed but that a child of three years of age was fidgety."

42078,"from her sister, begun at Steventon and finished in Winchester."
42078,""
42078,"We have felt, we do feel, for you all, as you will not need to be"
42078,"told,--for you, for Fanny, for Henry, for Lady Bridges, and for dearest"
42078,"Edward, whose loss and whose sufferings seem to make those of every"
42078,"other person nothing. God be praised that you can say what you do of"
42078,"him: that he has a religious mind to bear him up, and a disposition that"
42078,"will gradually lead him to comfort."
42078,""
42078,"My dear, dear Fanny, I am so thankful that she has you with her! You"
42078,"will be everything to her; you will give her all the consolation that"
42078,"human aid can give. May the Almighty sustain you all, and keep you, my"
42078,"dearest Cassandra, well; but for the present I dare say you are equal to"
42078,"everything."
42078,""
42078,"You will know that the poor boys are at Steventon. Perhaps it is best"
42078,"for them, as they will have more means of exercise and amusement there"
42078,"than they could have with us, but I own myself disappointed by the"
42078,"arrangement. I should have loved to have them with me at such a time. I"
42078,"shall write to Edward by this post."
42078,""
42078,"We shall, of course, hear from you again very soon, and as often as you"
42078,"can write. We will write as you desire, and I shall add Bookham."
42078,"Hamstall, I suppose, you write to yourselves, as you do not mention it."
42078,""
42078,"What a comfort that Mrs. Deedes is saved from present misery and alarm!"
42078,"But it will fall heavy upon poor Harriot; and as for Lady B., but that"
42078,"her fortitude does seem truly great, I should fear the effect of such a"
42078,"blow, and so unlooked for. I long to hear more of you all. Of Henry's"
42078,"anguish I think with grief and solicitude; but he will exert himself to"
42078,"be of use and comfort."
42078,""
42078,"With what true sympathy our feelings are shared by Martha you need not"
42078,"be told; she is the friend and sister under every circumstance."

42078,"We need not enter into a panegyric on the departed, but it is sweet to"
42078,"think of her great worth, of her solid principles, of her true devotion,"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your accounts make us as comfortable as we can"
42078,"expect to be at such a time. Edward's loss is terrible, and must be felt"
42078,"as such, and these are too early days indeed to think of moderation in"
42078,"grief, either in him or his afflicted daughter, but soon we may hope"
42078,"that our dear Fanny's sense of duty to that beloved father will rouse"
42078,"her to exertion. For his sake, and as the most acceptable proof of love"
42078,"to the spirit of her departed mother, she will try to be tranquil and"
42078,"resigned. Does she feel you to be a comfort to her, or is she too much"
42078,"overpowered for anything but solitude?"
42078,""
42078,"Your account of Lizzy is very interesting. Poor child! One must hope the"
42078,"impression will be strong, and yet one's heart aches for a dejected mind"
42078,"of eight years old."
42078,""
42078,"I suppose you see the corpse? How does it appear? We are anxious to be"
42078,"assured that Edward will not attend the funeral, but when it comes to"
42078,"the point I think he must feel it impossible."
42078,""
42078,"Your parcel shall set off on Monday, and I hope the shoes will fit;"
42078,"Martha and I both tried them on. I shall send you such of your mourning"
42078,"as I think most likely to be useful, reserving for myself your stockings"
42078,"and half the velvet, in which selfish arrangement I know I am doing what"
42078,"you wish."
42078,""
42078,"I am to be in bombazeen and crape, according to what we are told is"
42078,"universal here, and which agrees with Martha's previous observation. My"
42078,"mourning, however, will not impoverish me, for by having my velvet"
42078,"pelisse fresh lined and made up, I am sure I shall have no occasion this"
42078,"winter for anything new of that sort. I take my cloak for the lining,"
42078,"and shall send yours on the chance of its doing something of the same"
42078,"for you, though I believe your pelisse is in better repair than mine."
42078,"One Miss Baker makes my gown and the other my bonnet, which is to be"

42078,""
42078,"I have written to Edward Cooper, and hope he will not send one of his"
42078,"letters of cruel comfort to my poor brother: and yesterday I wrote to"
42078,"Alethea Bigg, in reply to a letter from her. She tells us in confidence"
42078,"that Catherine is to be married on Tuesday se'nnight. Mr. Hill is"
42078,"expected at Manydown in the course of the ensuing week."

42078,"We are desired by Mrs. Harrison and Miss Austen to say everything proper"
42078,"for them to yourself and Edward on this sad occasion, especially that"
42078,"nothing but a wish of not giving additional trouble where so much is"
42078,"inevitable prevents their writing themselves to express their concern."
42078,"They seem truly to feel concern."
42078,""
42078,"I am glad you can say what you do of Mrs. Knight and of Goodnestone in"
42078,"general. It is a great relief to me to know that the shock did not make"
42078,"any of them ill. But what a task was yours to announce it! Now I hope"
42078,"you are not overpowered with letter-writing, as Henry and John can ease"
42078,"you of many of your correspondents."
42078,""

42078,""
42078,"Upon your letter to Dr. Goddard's being forwarded to them, Mary wrote to"
42078,"ask whether my mother wished to have her grandsons sent to her. We"
42078,"decided on their remaining where they were, which I hope my brother will"
42078,"approve of. I am sure he will do us the justice of believing that in"
42078,"such a decision we sacrificed inclination to what we thought best."
42078,""
42078,"I shall write by the coach to-morrow to Mrs. J. A., and to Edward, about"
42078,"their mourning, though this day's post will probably bring directions to"
42078,"them on that subject from yourselves. I shall certainly make use of the"
42078,"opportunity of addressing our nephew on the most serious of all"
42078,"concerns, as I naturally did in my letter to him before. The poor boys"
42078,"are, perhaps, more comfortable at Steventon than they could be here, but"
42078,"you will understand my feelings with respect to it."
42078,""
42078,"To-morrow will be a dreadful day for you all. Mr. Whitfield's will be a"

42078,"mournful party in my mind's eye under every varying circumstance of the"
42078,"day; and in the evening especially figure to myself its sad gloom: the"
42078,"efforts to talk, the frequent summons to melancholy orders and cares,"
42078,"and poor Edward, restless in misery, going from one room to another, and"
42078,"perhaps not seldom upstairs, to see all that remains of his Elizabeth."
42078,"Dearest Fanny must now look upon herself as his prime source of comfort,"
42078,"his dearest friend; as the being who is gradually to supply to him, to"
42078,"the extent that is possible, what he has lost. This consideration will"
42078,"elevate and cheer her."

42078,"Adieu. You cannot write too often, as I said before. We are heartily"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Edward and George came to us soon after seven on"
42078,"Saturday, very well, but very cold, having by choice travelled on the"
42078,"outside, and with no greatcoat but what Mr. Wise, the coachman,"
42078,"good-naturedly spared them of his, as they sat by his side. They were so"
42078,"much chilled when they arrived, that I was afraid they must have taken"
42078,"cold; but it does not seem at all the case: I never saw them looking"
42078,"better."
42078,""
42078,"They behave extremely well in every respect, showing quite as much"
42078,"feeling as one wishes to see, and on every occasion speaking of their"
42078,"father with the liveliest affection. His letter was read over by each of"
42078,"them yesterday, and with many tears; George sobbed aloud, Edward's tears"
42078,"do not flow so easily; but as far as I can judge they are both very"
42078,"properly impressed by what has happened. Miss Lloyd, who is a more"
42078,"impartial judge than I can be, is exceedingly pleased with them."
42078,""
42078,"George is almost a new acquaintance to me, and I find him in a different"

42078,"well employed; and we mean to avail ourselves of our kind papa's"
42078,"consideration, by not returning to Winchester till quite the evening of"
42078,"Wednesday."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. J. A. had not time to get them more than one suit of clothes; their"
42078,"others are making here, and though I do not believe Southampton is"
42078,"famous for tailoring, I hope it will prove itself better than"
42078,"Basingstoke. Edward has an old black coat, which will save his having a"
42078,"second new one; but I find that black pantaloons are considered by them"
42078,"as necessary, and of course one would not have them made uncomfortable"
42078,"by the want of what is usual on such occasions."
42078,""

42078,""
42078,"The ""St. Albans,"" I find, sailed on the very day of my letters reaching"
42078,"Yarmouth, so that we must not expect an answer at present; we scarcely"
42078,"feel, however, to be in suspense, or only enough to keep our plans to"
42078,"ourselves. We have been obliged to explain them to our young visitors,"
42078,"in consequence of Fanny's letter, but we have not yet mentioned them to"
42078,"Steventon. We are all quite familiarized to the idea ourselves; my"

42078,"What sort of a kitchen garden is there? Mrs. J. A. expresses her fear of"
42078,"our settling in Kent, and, till this proposal was made, we began to look"
42078,"forward to it here; my mother was actually talking of a house at Wye. It"

42078,"indeed, I could have supposed purposely addressed to the afflicted, if"
42078,"the text had not naturally come in the course of Dr. Mant's observations"
42078,"on the Litany: 'All that are in danger, necessity, or tribulation,' was"
42078,"the subject of it. The weather did not allow us afterwards to get"
42078,"farther than the quay, where George was very happy as long as we could"
42078,"stay, flying about from one side to the other, and skipping on board a"
42078,"collier immediately."
42078,""
42078,"In the evening we had the Psalms and Lessons, and a sermon at home, to"
42078,"which they were very attentive; but you will not expect to hear that"

42078,"All that you say of Edward is truly comfortable; I began to fear that"
42078,"when the bustle of the first week was over, his spirits might for a time"
42078,"be more depressed; and perhaps one must still expect something of the"
42078,"kind. If you escape a bilious attack, I shall wonder almost as much as"
42078,"rejoice. I am glad you mentioned where Catherine goes to-day; it is a"
42078,"good plan, but sensible people may generally be trusted to form such."
42078,""
42078,"The day began cheerfully, but it is not likely to continue what it"
42078,"should, for them or for us. We had a little water-party yesterday; I and"
42078,"my two nephews went from the Itchen Ferry up to Northam, where we"
42078,"landed, looked into the 74, and walked home, and it was so much enjoyed"
42078,"that I had intended to take them to Netley to-day; the tide is just"
42078,"right for our going immediately after moonshine, but I am afraid there"
42078,"will be rain; if we cannot get so far, however, we may perhaps go round"
42078,"from the ferry to the quay."
42078,""
42078,"I had not proposed doing more than cross the Itchen yesterday, but it"
42078,"proved so pleasant, and so much to the satisfaction of all, that when we"
42078,"reached the middle of the stream we agreed to be rowed up the river;"
42078,"both the boys rowed great part of the way, and their questions and"
42078,"remarks, as well as their enjoyment, were very amusing; George's"
42078,"inquiries were endless, and his eagerness in everything reminds me often"
42078,"of his uncle Henry."
42078,""
42078,"Our evening was equally agreeable in its way: I introduced speculation,"
42078,"and it was so much approved that we hardly knew how to leave off."
42078,""
42078,"Your idea of an early dinner to-morrow is exactly what we propose, for,"
42078,"after writing the first part of this letter, it came into my head that"
42078,"at this time of year we have not summer evenings. We shall watch the"
42078,"light to-day, that we may not give them a dark drive to-morrow."

42078,"unsuspicious. Mr. Maxwell was tutor to the young Gregorys,--consequently,"
42078,"they must be one of the happiest couples in the world, and either of"
42078,"them worthy of envy, for she must be excessively in love, and he mounts"
42078,"from nothing to a comfortable home. Martha has heard him very highly"
42078,"spoken of. They continue for the present at Speen Hill."
42078,""
42078,"I have a Southampton match to return for your Kentish one, Captain G."
42078,"Heathcote and Miss A. Lyell. I have it from Alethea, and like it,"
42078,"because I had made it before."
42078,""
42078,"Yes, the Stoneleigh business is concluded, but it was not till yesterday"
42078,"that my mother was regularly informed of it, though the news had reached"
42078,"us on Monday evening by way of Steventon. My aunt says as little as may"
42078,"be on the subject by way of information, and nothing at all by way of"
42078,"satisfaction. She reflects on Mr. T. Leigh's dilatoriness, and looks"
42078,"about with great diligence and success for inconvenience and evil, among"
42078,"which she ingeniously places the danger of her new housemaids catching"
42078,"cold on the outside of the coach, when she goes down to Bath, for a"
42078,"carriage makes her sick."
42078,""
42078,"John Binns has been offered their place, but declines it; as she"
42078,"supposes, because he will not wear a livery. Whatever be the cause, I"
42078,"like the effect."
42078,""
42078,"In spite of all my mother's long and intimate knowledge of the writer,"
42078,"she was not up to the expectation of such a letter as this; the"
42078,"discontentedness of it shocked and surprised her--but I see nothing in"
42078,"it out of nature, though a sad nature."
42078,""
42078,"She does not forget to wish for Chambers, you may be sure. No"
42078,"particulars are given, not a word of arrears mentioned, though in her"
42078,"letter to James they were in a general way spoken of. The amount of them"
42078,"is a matter of conjecture, and to my mother a most interesting one; she"
42078,"cannot fix any time for their beginning with any satisfaction to herself"
42078,"but Mrs. Leigh's death, and Henry's two thousand pounds neither agrees"
42078,"with that period nor any other. I did not like to own our previous"
42078,"information of what was intended last July, and have therefore only said"
42078,"that if we could see Henry we might hear many particulars, as I had"
42078,"understood that some confidential conversation had passed between him"
42078,"and Mr. T. L. at Stoneleigh."
42078,""
42078,"We have been as quiet as usual since Frank and Mary left us; Mr."
42078,"Criswick called on Martha that very morning on his way home again from"
42078,"Portsmouth, and we have had no visitor since."
42078,""
42078,"We called on the Miss Lyells one day, and heard a good account of Mr."
42078,"Heathcote's canvass, the success of which, of course, exceeds his"
42078,"expectations. Alethea in her letter hopes for my interest, which I"
42078,"conclude means Edward's, and I take this opportunity, therefore, of"
42078,"requesting that he will bring in Mr. Heathcote. Mr. Lane told us"
42078,"yesterday that Mr. H. had behaved very handsomely, and waited on Mr."
42078,"Thistlethwaite, to say that if he (Mr. T.) would stand, he (Mr. H.)"
42078,"would not oppose him; but Mr. T. declined it, acknowledging himself"
42078,"still smarting under the payment of late electioneering costs."
42078,""
42078,"The Mrs. Hulberts, we learn from Kintbury, come to Steventon this week,"
42078,"and bring Mary Jane Fowle with them on her way to Mrs. Nune's; she"
42078,"returns at Christmas with her brother."
42078,""
42078,"Our brother we may perhaps see in the course of a few days, and we mean"
42078,"to take the opportunity of his help to go one night to the play. Martha"
42078,"ought to see the inside of the theatre once while she lives in"
42078,"Southampton, and I think she will hardly wish to take a second view."
42078,""
42078,"The furniture of Bellevue is to be sold to-morrow, and we shall take it"
42078,"in our usual walk, if the weather be favorable."
42078,""
42078,"How could you have a wet day on Thursday? With us it was a prince of"
42078,"days, the most delightful we have had for weeks; soft, bright, with a"
42078,"brisk wind from the southwest; everybody was out and talking of spring,"
42078,"and Martha and I did not know how to turn back. On Friday evening we had"
42078,"some very blowing weather,--from six to nine; I think we never heard it"
42078,"worse, even here. And one night we had so much rain that it forced its"
42078,"way again into the store-closet; and though the evil was comparatively"
42078,"slight and the mischief nothing, I had some employment the next day in"
42078,"drying parcels, etc. I have now moved still more out of the way."
42078,""
42078,"Martha sends her best love, and thanks you for admitting her to the"
42078,"knowledge of the pros and cons about Harriet Foote; she has an interest"
42078,"in all such matters. I am also to say that she wants to see you. Mary"
42078,"Jane missed her papa and mamma a good deal at first, but now does very"
42078,"well without them. I am glad to hear of little John's being better, and"
42078,"hope your accounts of Mrs. Knight will also improve. Adieu! remember me"
42078,"affectionately to everybody, and believe me,"

42078,""
42078,"MANY thanks, my dear Cassandra, to you and Mr. Deedes for your joint and"
42078,"agreeable composition, which took me by surprise this morning. He has"
42078,"certainly great merit as a writer; he does ample justice to his subject,"
42078,"and without being diffuse is clear and correct; and though I do not"
42078,"mean to compare his epistolary powers with yours, or to give him the"
42078,"same portion of my gratitude, he certainly has a very pleasing way of"
42078,"winding up a whole, and speeding truth into the world."
42078,""
42078,"""But all this,"" as my dear Mrs. Piozzi says, ""is flight and fancy and"
42078,"nonsense, for my master has his great casks to mind and I have my little"
42078,"children."" It is you, however, in this instance, that have the little"
42078,"children, and I that have the great cask, for we are brewing spruce beer"
42078,"again; but my meaning really is, that I am extremely foolish in writing"
42078,"all this unnecessary stuff when I have so many matters to write about"
42078,"that my paper will hardly hold it all. Little matters they are, to be"
42078,"sure, but highly important."
42078,""
42078,"In the first place, Miss Curling is actually at Portsmouth, which I was"
42078,"always in hopes would not happen. I wish her no worse, however, than a"
42078,"long and happy abode there. Here she would probably be dull, and I am"
42078,"sure she would be troublesome."
42078,""
42078,"The bracelets are in my possession, and everything I could wish them to"
42078,"be. They came with Martha's pelisse, which likewise gives great"
42078,"satisfaction."
42078,""
42078,"Soon after I had closed my last letter to you we were visited by Mrs."
42078,"Dickens and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bertie, the wife of a lately made"
42078,"Admiral. Mrs. F. A.,[8] I believe, was their first object, but they put"
42078,"up with us very kindly, and Mrs. D., finding in Miss Lloyd a friend of"
42078,"Mrs. Dundas, had another motive for the acquaintance. She seems a really"
42078,"agreeable woman,--that is, her manners are gentle, and she knows a great"
42078,"many of our connections in West Kent. Mrs. Bertie lives in the Polygon,"
42078,"and was out when we returned her visit, which are her two virtues."
42078,""
42078,"A larger circle of acquaintance, and an increase of amusement, is quite"
42078,"in character with our approaching removal. Yes, I mean to go to as many"
42078,"balls as possible, that I may have a good bargain. Everybody is very"
42078,"much concerned at our going away, and everybody is acquainted with"
42078,"Chawton, and speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village, and everybody"
42078,"knows the house we describe, but nobody fixes on the right."
42078,""
42078,"I am very much obliged to Mrs. Knight for such a proof of the interest"
42078,"she takes in me, and she may depend upon it that I will marry Mr."
42078,"Papillon, whatever may be his reluctance or my own. I owe her much more"
42078,"than such a trifling sacrifice."
42078,""
42078,"Our ball was rather more amusing than I expected. Martha liked it very"
42078,"much, and I did not gape till the last quarter of an hour. It was past"
42078,"nine before we were sent for, and not twelve when we returned. The room"
42078,"was tolerably full, and there were, perhaps, thirty couple of dancers."
42078,"The melancholy part was to see so many dozen young women standing by"
42078,"without partners, and each of them with two ugly naked shoulders."
42078,""
42078,"It was the same room in which we danced fifteen years ago. I thought it"
42078,"all over, and in spite of the shame of being so much older, felt with"
42078,"thankfulness that I was quite as happy now as then. We paid an"
42078,"additional shilling for our tea, which we took as we chose in an"
42078,"adjoining and very comfortable room."
42078,""
42078,"There were only four dances, and it went to my heart that the Miss"
42078,"Lances (one of them, too, named Emma) should have partners only for two."
42078,"You will not expect to hear that I was asked to dance, but I was--by the"
42078,"gentleman whom we met that Sunday with Captain D'Auvergne. We have"
42078,"always kept up a bowing acquaintance since, and, being pleased with his"
42078,"black eyes, I spoke to him at the ball, which brought on me this"
42078,"civility; but I do not know his name, and he seems so little at home in"
42078,"the English language that I believe his black eyes may be the best of"
42078,"him. Captain D'Auvergne has got a ship."
42078,""
42078,"Martha and I made use of the very favorable state of yesterday for"
42078,"walking, to pay our duty at Chiswell. We found Mrs. Lance at home and"
42078,"alone, and sat out three other ladies who soon came in. We went by the"
42078,"ferry, and returned by the bridge, and were scarcely at all fatigued."
42078,""
42078,"Edward must have enjoyed the last two days. You, I presume, had a cool"
42078,"drive to Canterbury. Kitty Foote came on Wednesday; and her evening"
42078,"visit began early enough for the last part, the apple-pie, of our"
42078,"dinner, for we never dine now till five."
42078,""
42078,"Yesterday I--or rather, you--had a letter from Nanny Hilliard, the"
42078,"object of which is that she would be very much obliged to us if we would"
42078,"get Hannah a place. I am sorry that I cannot assist her; if you can, let"
42078,"me know, as I shall not answer the letter immediately. Mr. Sloper is"
42078,"married again, not much to Nanny's, or anybody's satisfaction. The lady"
42078,"was governess to Sir Robert's natural children, and seems to have"
42078,"nothing to recommend her. I do not find, however, that Nanny is likely"
42078,"to lose her place in consequence. She says not a word of what service"
42078,"she wishes for Hannah, or what Hannah can do; but a nursery, I suppose,"
42078,"or something of that kind, must be the thing."
42078,""
42078,"Having now cleared away my smaller articles of news, I come to a"
42078,"communication of some weight; no less than that my uncle and aunt[9] are"
42078,"going to allow James 100_l._ a year. We hear of it through Steventon."
42078,"Mary sent us the other day an extract from my aunt's letter on the"
42078,"subject, in which the donation is made with the greatest kindness, and"
42078,"intended as a compensation for his loss in the conscientious refusal of"
42078,"Hampstead living; 100_l._ a year being all that he had at the time"
42078,"called its worth, as I find it was always intended at Steventon to"
42078,"divide the real income with Kintbury."
42078,""
42078,"Nothing can be more affectionate than my aunt's language in making the"
42078,"present, and likewise in expressing her hope of their being much more"
42078,"together in future than, to her great regret, they have of late years"
42078,"been. My expectations for my mother do not rise with this event. We will"
42078,"allow a little more time, however, before we fly out."
42078,""
42078,"If not prevented by parish business, James comes to us on Monday. The"
42078,"Mrs. Hulberts and Miss Murden are their guests at present, and likely to"
42078,"continue such till Christmas. Anna comes home on the 19th. The hundred a"
42078,"year begins next Lady-day."
42078,""
42078,"I am glad you are to have Henry with you again; with him and the boys"
42078,"you cannot but have a cheerful, and at times even a merry, Christmas."
42078,"Martha is so [_MSS. torn_]. . . . We want to be settled at Chawton in time"
42078,"for Henry to come to us for some shooting in October, at least, or a"
42078,"little earlier, and Edward may visit us after taking his boys back to"
42078,"Winchester. Suppose we name the 4th of September. Will not that do?"
42078,""
42078,"I have but one thing more to tell you. Mrs. Hill called on my mother"
42078,"yesterday while we were gone to Chiswell, and in the course of the"
42078,"visit asked her whether she knew anything of a clergyman's family of the"
42078,"name of Alford, who had resided in our part of Hampshire. Mrs. Hill had"
42078,"been applied to as likely to give some information of them on account of"
42078,"their probable vicinity to Dr. Hill's living by a lady, or for a lady,"
42078,"who had known Mrs. and the two Miss Alfords in Bath, whither they had"
42078,"removed it seems from Hampshire, and who now wishes to convey to the"
42078,"Miss Alfords some work or trimming which she has been doing for them;"
42078,"but the mother and daughters have left Bath, and the lady cannot learn"
42078,"where they are gone to. While my mother gave us the account, the"
42078,"probability of its being ourselves occurred to us, and it had previously"
42078,"struck herself . . . what makes it more likely, and even indispensably"
42078,"to be us, is that she mentioned Mr. Hammond as now having the living or"
42078,"curacy which the father had had. I cannot think who our kind lady can"
42078,"be, but I dare say we shall not like the work."
42078,""
42078,"Distribute the affectionate love of a heart not so tired as the right"
42078,"hand belonging to it."

42078,"I was very glad of your letter this morning; for, my mother taking"
42078,"medicine, Eliza keeping her bed with a cold, and Choles not coming, made"
42078,"us rather dull and dependent on the post. You tell me much that gives me"
42078,"pleasure, but I think not much to answer. I wish I could help you in"
42078,"your needlework. I have two hands and a new thimble that lead a very"

42078,"Lady Sondes' match surprises, but does not offend me; had her first"

42078,"though he held the newspaper in his hand; he was making up his mind to"
42078,"the deed, and the manner of it. I think you will have a letter from him"
42078,"soon."
42078,""
42078,"I heard from Portsmouth yesterday, and as I am to send them more"
42078,"clothes, they cannot be expecting a very early return to us. Mary's face"
42078,"is pretty well, but she must have suffered a great deal with it; an"
42078,"abscess was formed and opened."
42078,""
42078,"Our evening party on Thursday produced nothing more remarkable than Miss"
42078,"Murden's coming too, though she had declined it absolutely in the"
42078,"morning, and sitting very ungracious and very silent with us from seven"
42078,"o'clock till half after eleven, for so late was it, owing to the"

42078,""
42078,"The last hour, spent in yawning and shivering in a wide circle round the"

42078,"and the preserved ginger were as delicious as one could wish. But as to"
42078,"our black butter, do not decoy anybody to Southampton by such a lure,"
42078,"for it is all gone. The first pot was opened when Frank and Mary were"
42078,"here, and proved not at all what it ought to be; it was neither solid"
42078,"nor entirely sweet, and on seeing it, Eliza remembered that Miss Austen"
42078,"had said she did not think it had been boiled enough. It was made, you"
42078,"know, when we were absent. Such being the event of the first pot, I"
42078,"would not save the second, and we therefore ate it in unpretending"

42078,"James means to keep three horses on this increase of income; at present"

42078,"Mary does not talk of the garden; it may well be a disagreeable subject"
42078,"to her, but her husband is persuaded that nothing is wanting to make the"
42078,"first new one good but trenching, which is to be done by his own"

42078,"their fellow-inmates, Mrs. Drew and Miss Hook, Mr. Wynne and Mr."
42078,"Fitzhugh; the latter is brother to Mrs. Lance, and very much the"

42078,"it fired close to him; having no cannon at hand to make the experiment,"
42078,"I took it for granted, and talked to him a little with my fingers, which"

42078,""
42078,"Miss Hook is a well-behaved, genteelish woman; Mrs. Drew well behaved,"
42078,"without being at all genteel. Mr. Wynne seems a chatty and rather"

42078,"evening from what she had been before, owing to her having with Martha's"
42078,"help found a situation in the morning, which bids very fair for comfort."
42078,"When she leaves Steventon, she comes to board and lodge with Mrs."

42078,"in any hurry for the conclusion of her present visit, but I was truly"
42078,"glad to see her comfortable in mind and spirits; at her age, perhaps,"
42078,"one may be as friendless oneself, and in similar circumstances quite as"

42078,"My mother has been lately adding to her possessions in plate,--a whole"

42078,"makes our sideboard border on the magnificent. They were mostly the"
42078,"produce of old or useless silver. I have turned the 11_s._ in the list"
42078,"into 12_s._, and the card looks all the better; a silver tea-ladle is"

42078,"this, if everything goes on well."
42078,""
42078,"Her disorder is an inflammation on the lungs, arising from a severe"
42078,"chill taken in church last Sunday three weeks; her mind all pious"
42078,"composure, as may be supposed. George Cooke was there when her illness"
42078,"began; his brother has now taken his place. Her age and feebleness"
42078,"considered, one's fears cannot but preponderate, though her amendment"
42078,"has already surpassed the expectation of the physician at the beginning."

42078,"is the day; we are to sleep that night at Alton, and be with our friends"
42078,"at Bookham the next, if they are then at home; there we remain till the"
42078,"following Monday, and on Tuesday, April 11, hope to be at Godmersham. If"

42078,"occasion. Your offer of cravats is very kind, and happens to be"

42078,"least likely to be troublesome. I have called on them this morning and"
42078,"found them very willing, and I am sorry that you must wait a whole week"
42078,"for the particulars of the evening. I propose being asked to dance by"

42078,"Leigh, even for a moment, a veteran soldier. She, good woman, is, I"

42078,"I had this pleasant news in a letter from Bookham last Thursday; but as"
42078,"the letter was from Mary instead of her mother, you will guess her"
42078,"account was not equally good from home. Mrs. Cooke had been confined to"
42078,"her bed some days by illness, but was then better, and Mary wrote in"
42078,"confidence of her continuing to mend. I have desired to hear again soon."
42078,""
42078,"You rejoice me by what you say of Fanny.[12] I hope she will not turn"
42078,"good-for-nothing this ever so long. We thought of and talked of her"
42078,"yesterday with sincere affection, and wished her a long enjoyment of all"
42078,"the happiness to which she seems born. While she gives happiness to"
42078,"those about her she is pretty sure of her own share."
42078,""
42078,"I am gratified by her having pleasure in what I write, but I wish the"
42078,"knowledge of my being exposed to her discerning criticism may not hurt"
42078,"my style, by inducing too great a solicitude. I begin already to weigh"
42078,"my words and sentences more than I did, and am looking about for a"
42078,"sentiment, an illustration, or a metaphor in every corner of the room."
42078,"Could my ideas flow as fast as the rain in the store-closet, it would be"
42078,"charming."
42078,""
42078,"We have been in two or three dreadful states within the last week, from"
42078,"the melting of the snow, etc., and the contest between us and the closet"
42078,"has now ended in our defeat. I have been obliged to move almost"
42078,"everything out of it, and leave it to splash itself as it likes."
42078,""
42078,"You have by no means raised my curiosity after Caleb. My disinclination"
42078,"for it before was affected, but now it is real. I do not like the"
42078,"evangelicals. Of course I shall be delighted when I read it, like other"
42078,"people; but till I do I dislike it."
42078,""
42078,"I am sorry my verses did not bring any return from Edward. I was in"
42078,"hopes they might, but I suppose he does not rate them high enough. It"
42078,"might be partiality, but they seemed to me purely classical,--just like"
42078,"Homer and Virgil, Ovid and Propria que Maribus."
42078,""
42078,"I had a nice brotherly letter from Frank the other day, which, after an"
42078,"interval of nearly three weeks, was very welcome. No orders were come on"
42078,"Friday, and none were come yesterday, or we should have heard to-day. I"
42078,"had supposed Miss C. would share her cousin's room here, but a message"
42078,"in this letter proves the contrary. I will make the garret as"
42078,"comfortable as I can, but the possibilities of that apartment are not"
42078,"great."

42078,"My mother has been talking to Eliza about our future home, and she,"
42078,"making no difficulty at all of the sweetheart, is perfectly disposed to"
42078,"continue with us, but till she has written home for mother's approbation"
42078,"cannot quite decide. Mother does not like to have her so far off. At"
42078,"Chawton she will be nine or ten miles nearer, which I hope will have its"
42078,"due influence."

42078,"As for Sally, she means to play John Binns with us, in her anxiety to"
42078,"belong to our household again. Hitherto she appears a very good servant."

42078,"Your silence on the subject of our ball makes me suppose your curiosity"
42078,"too great for words. We were very well entertained, and could have"
42078,"stayed longer but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home,"
42078,"and I did not like to keep them waiting in the cold. The room was"
42078,"tolerably full, and the ball opened by Miss Glyn. The Miss Lances had"
42078,"partners, Captain Dauvergne's friend appeared in regimentals, Caroline"
42078,"Maitland had an officer to flirt with, and Mr. John Harrison was deputed"
42078,"by Captain Smith, being himself absent, to ask me to dance. Everything"
42078,"went well, you see, especially after we had tucked Mrs. Lance's"
42078,"neckerchief in behind and fastened it with a pin."
42078,""
42078,"We had a very full and agreeable account of Mr. Hammond's ball from Anna"
42078,"last night; the same fluent pen has sent similar information, I know,"
42078,"into Kent. She seems to have been as happy as one could wish her, and"
42078,"the complacency of her mamma in doing the honors of the evening must"
42078,"have made her pleasure almost as great. The grandeur of the meeting was"
42078,"beyond my hopes. I should like to have seen Anna's looks and"
42078,"performance, but that sad cropped head must have injured the former."
42078,""
42078,"Martha pleases herself with believing that if I had kept her counsel you"
42078,"would never have heard of Dr. M.'s late behavior, as if the very slight"
42078,"manner in which I mentioned it could have been all on which you found"
42078,"your judgment. I do not endeavor to undeceive her, because I wish her"
42078,"happy, at all events, and know how highly she prizes happiness of any"
42078,"kind. She is, moreover, so full of kindness for us both, and sends you"
42078,"in particular so many good wishes about your finger, that I am willing"
42078,"to overlook a venial fault, and as Dr. M. is a clergyman, their"
42078,"attachment, however immoral, has a decorous air. Adieu, sweet You. This"
42078,"is grievous news from Spain. It is well that Dr. Moore was spared the"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I have so many little matters to tell you of, that I"
42078,"cannot wait any longer before I begin to put them down. I spent Tuesday"
42078,"in Bentinck Street. The Cookes called here and took me back, and it was"
42078,"quite a Cooke day, for the Miss Rolles paid a visit while I was there,"
42078,"and Sam Arnold dropped in to tea."

42078,"The badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine,--that"
42078,"of calling on Miss Beckford again; but from the middle of the day it"
42078,"rained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing of her father and"
42078,"mother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had"
42078,"some amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always"
42078,"inclines me to attend more to the company than the sight."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called;"
42078,"it was owing to a blunder among the servants, for she did not know of"
42078,"our visit till we were gone. She seems tolerably well, but the nervous"
42078,"part of her complaint, I fear, increases, and makes her more and more"
42078,"unwilling to part with Mary."
42078,""
42078,"I have proposed to the latter that she should go to Chawton with me, on"
42078,"the supposition of my travelling the Guildford road, and she, I do"
42078,"believe, would be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;"
42078,"unless a brother can be at home at that time, it certainly must. George"

42078,"civility. Henry, who had been confined the whole day to the bank, took"
42078,"me in his way home, and, after putting life and wit into the party for a"
42078,"quarter of an hour, put himself and his sister into a hackney coach."
42078,""
42078,"I bless my stars that I have done with Tuesday. But, alas! Wednesday was"
42078,"likewise a day of great doings, for Manon and I took our walk to Grafton"
42078,"House, and I have a good deal to say on that subject."

42078,"I am sorry to tell you that I am getting very extravagant, and spending"

42078,"too; for in a linendraper's shop to which I went for checked muslin, and"
42078,"for which I was obliged to give seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by"
42078,"a pretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it on the chance of"
42078,"your liking it; but at the same time, if it should not suit you, you"
42078,"must not think yourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3_s._"
42078,"6_d._ per yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping the whole. In"
42078,"texture it is just what we prefer, but its resemblance to green crewels,"
42078,"I must own, is not great, for the pattern is a small red spot. And now I"
42078,"believe I have done all my commissions except Wedgwood."
42078,""
42078,"I liked my walk very much; it was shorter than I had expected, and the"
42078,"weather was delightful. We set off immediately after breakfast, and must"
42078,"have reached Grafton House by half-past eleven; but when we entered the"
42078,"shop the whole counter was thronged, and we waited full half an hour"
42078,"before we could be attended to. When we were served, however, I was"
42078,"very well satisfied with my purchases,--my bugle trimming at 2_s._ 4_d._"
42078,"and three pair silk stockings for a little less than 12_s._ a pair."

42078,"me one. I am really very shocking, but it will not be dear at a guinea."

42078,"besides amateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings is a"
42078,"Capital on the harp, from which I expect great pleasure. The foundation"
42078,"of the party was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter, but the"
42078,"latter leaves town the day before. I am sorry, as I wished her prejudice"
42078,"to be done away, but should have been more sorry if there had been no"
42078,"invitation."

42078,"a far more lasting interest,--the society in which you are; but I do"

42078,"succeeds Lord Gambier in his command, and some captain of his succeeds"
42078,"Frank; and I believe the order is already gone out. Henry means to"
42078,"inquire further to-day. He wrote to Mary on the occasion. This is"
42078,"something to think of. Henry is convinced that he will have the offer of"

42078,"first a grief, but she has since supplied herself so well with"
42078,"performers that it is of no consequence; their not coming has produced"
42078,"our going to them to-morrow evening, which I like the idea of. It will"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I can return the compliment by thanking you for"
42078,"the unexpected pleasure of your letter yesterday, and as I like"
42078,"unexpected pleasure, it made me very happy; and, indeed, you need not"
42078,"apologize for your letter in any respect, for it is all very fine, but"
42078,"not too fine, I hope, to be written again, or something like it."
42078,""
42078,"I think Edward will not suffer much longer from heat; by the look of"
42078,"things this morning I suspect the weather is rising into the balsamic"
42078,"north-east. It has been hot here, as you may suppose, since it was so"
42078,"hot with you, but I have not suffered from it at all, nor felt it in"
42078,"such a degree as to make me imagine it would be anything in the country."
42078,"Everybody has talked of the heat, but I set it all down to London."
42078,""
42078,"I give you joy of our new nephew, and hope if he ever comes to be hanged"
42078,"it will not be till we are too old to care about it. It is a great"
42078,"comfort to have it so safely and speedily over. The Miss Curlings must"
42078,"be hard worked in writing so many letters, but the novelty of it may"
42078,"recommend it to them; mine was from Miss Eliza, and she says that my"
42078,"brother may arrive to-day."
42078,""
42078,"No, indeed, I am never too busy to think of S. and S.[13] I can no more"
42078,"forget it than a mother can forget her sucking child; and I am much"
42078,"obliged to you for your inquiries. I have had two sheets to correct, but"
42078,"the last only brings us to Willoughby's first appearance. Mrs. K."
42078,"regrets in the most flattering manner that she must wait till May, but I"
42078,"have scarcely a hope of its being out in June. Henry does not neglect"
42078,"it; he has hurried the printer, and says he will see him again to-day."
42078,"It will not stand still during his absence, it will be sent to Eliza."
42078,""
42078,"The Incomes remain as they were, but I will get them altered if I can. I"
42078,"am very much gratified by Mrs. K.'s interest in it; and whatever may be"
42078,"the event of it as to my credit with her, sincerely wish her curiosity"
42078,"could be satisfied sooner than is now probable. I think she will like my"
42078,"Elinor, but cannot build on anything else."
42078,""
42078,"Our party went off extremely well. There were many solicitudes, alarms,"
42078,"and vexations beforehand, of course, but at last everything was quite"
42078,"right. The rooms were dressed up with flowers, etc., and looked very"
42078,"pretty. A glass for the mantelpiece was lent by the man who is making"
42078,"their own. Mr. Egerton and Mr. Walter came at half-past five, and the"
42078,"festivities began with a pair of very fine soles."
42078,""
42078,"Yes, Mr. Walter--for he postponed his leaving London on purpose--which"
42078,"did not give much pleasure at the time, any more than the circumstance"
42078,"from which it rose,--his calling on Sunday and being asked by Henry to"
42078,"take the family dinner on that day, which he did; but it is all smoothed"
42078,"over now, and she likes him very well."
42078,""
42078,"At half-past seven arrived the musicians in two hackney coaches, and by"
42078,"eight the lordly company began to appear. Among the earliest were George"
42078,"and Mary Cooke, and I spent the greatest part of the evening very"
42078,"pleasantly with them. The drawing-room being soon hotter than we liked,"
42078,"we placed ourselves in the connecting passage, which was comparatively"
42078,"cool, and gave us all the advantage of the music at a pleasant distance,"
42078,"as well as that of the first view of every new-comer."
42078,""
42078,"I was quite surrounded by acquaintance, especially gentlemen; and what"
42078,"with Mr. Hampson, Mr. Seymour, Mr. W. Knatchbull, Mr. Guillemarde, Mr."
42078,"Cure, a Captain Simpson, brother to _the_ Captain Simpson, besides Mr."
42078,"Walter and Mr. Egerton, in addition to the Cookes, and Miss Beckford,"
42078,"and Miss Middleton, I had quite as much upon my hands as I could do."
42078,""
42078,"Poor Miss B. has been suffering again from her old complaint, and looks"
42078,"thinner than ever. She certainly goes to Cheltenham the beginning of"
42078,"June. We were all delight and cordiality, of course. Miss M. seems very"
42078,"happy, but has not beauty enough to figure in London."
42078,""
42078,"Including everybody we were sixty-six,--which was considerably more than"
42078,"Eliza had expected, and quite enough to fill the back drawing-room and"
42078,"leave a few to be scattered about in the other and in the passage."
42078,""
42078,"The music was extremely good. It opened (tell Fanny) with ""Poike de Parp"
42078,"pirs praise pof Prapela;"" and of the other glees I remember, ""In peace"
42078,"love tunes,"" ""Rosabelle,"" ""The Red Cross Knight,"" and ""Poor Insect."""
42078,"Between the songs were lessons on the harp, or harp and pianoforte"
42078,"together; and the harp-player was Wiepart, whose name seems famous,"
42078,"though new to me. There was one female singer, a short Miss Davis, all"
42078,"in blue, bringing up for the public line, whose voice was said to be"
42078,"very fine indeed; and all the performers gave great satisfaction by"
42078,"doing what they were paid for, and giving themselves no airs. No amateur"
42078,"could be persuaded to do anything."
42078,""
42078,"The house was not clear till after twelve. If you wish to hear more of"
42078,"it, you must put your questions, but I seem rather to have exhausted"
42078,"than spared the subject."
42078,""
42078,"This said Captain Simpson told us, on the authority of some other"
42078,"Captain just arrived from Halifax, that Charles was bringing the"
42078,"""Cleopatra"" home, and that she was probably by this time in the"
42078,"Channel; but as Captain S. was certainly in liquor, we must not quite"
42078,"depend on it. It must give one a sort of expectation, however, and will"
42078,"prevent my writing to him any more. I would rather he should not reach"
42078,"England till I am at home, and the Steventon party gone."
42078,""
42078,"My mother and Martha both write with great satisfaction of Anna's"
42078,"behavior. She is quite an Anna with variations, but she cannot have"
42078,"reached her last, for that is always the most flourishing and showy; she"
42078,"is at about her third or fourth, which are generally simple and pretty."
42078,""
42078,"Your lilacs are in leaf, ours are in bloom. The horse-chestnuts are"
42078,"quite out, and the elms almost. I had a pleasant walk in Kensington"
42078,"Gardens on Sunday with Henry, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Tilson; everything was"
42078,"fresh and beautiful."
42078,""
42078,"We did go to the play, after all, on Saturday. We went to the Lyceum,"
42078,"and saw the ""Hypocrite,"" an old play taken from Moliere's ""Tartuffe,"""
42078,"and were well entertained. Dowton and Mathews were the good actors; Mrs."
42078,"Edwin was the heroine, and her performance is just what it used to be. I"
42078,"have no chance of seeing Mrs. Siddons; she did act on Monday, but as"
42078,"Henry was told by the box-keeper that he did not think she would, the"
42078,"plans, and all thought of it, were given up. I should particularly have"
42078,"liked seeing her in ""Constance,"" and could swear at her with little"
42078,"effort for disappointing me."
42078,""
42078,"Henry has been to the Water-Color Exhibition, which opened on Monday,"
42078,"and is to meet us there again some morning. If Eliza cannot go (and she"
42078,"has a cold at present), Miss Beaty will be invited to be my companion."
42078,"Henry leaves town on Sunday afternoon, but he means to write soon"
42078,"himself to Edward, and will tell his own plans."
42078,""
42078,"The tea is this moment setting out."
42078,""
42078,"Do not have your colored muslin unless you really want it, because I am"
42078,"afraid I could not send it to the coach without giving trouble here."
42078,""
42078,"Eliza caught her cold on Sunday in our way to the D'Entraigues. The"
42078,"horses actually gibbed on this side of Hyde Park Gate: a load of fresh"
42078,"gravel made it a formidable hill to them, and they refused the collar; I"
42078,"believe there was a sore shoulder to irritate. Eliza was frightened, and"
42078,"we got out, and were detained in the evening air several minutes. The"
42078,"cold is in her chest, but she takes care of herself, and I hope it may"
42078,"not last long."
42078,""
42078,"This engagement prevented Mr. Walter's staying late,--he had his coffee"
42078,"and went away. Eliza enjoyed her evening very much, and means to"
42078,"cultivate the acquaintance; and I see nothing to dislike in them but"
42078,"their taking quantities of snuff. Monsieur, the old Count, is a very"
42078,"fine-looking man, with quiet manners, good enough for an Englishman,"
42078,"and, I believe, is a man of great information and taste. He has some"
42078,"fine paintings, which delighted Henry as much as the son's music"
42078,"gratified Eliza; and among them a miniature of Philip V. of Spain, Louis"
42078,"XIV.'s grandson, which exactly suited my capacity. Count Julien's"
42078,"performance is very wonderful."
42078,""
42078,"We met only Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, and we are just now engaged to"
42078,"spend next Sunday evening at Mrs. L.'s, and to meet the D'Entraigues,"
42078,"but M. le Comte must do without Henry. If he would but speak English, I"
42078,"would take to him."
42078,""
42078,"Have you ever mentioned the leaving off tea to Mrs. K.? Eliza has just"
42078,"spoken of it again. The benefit she has found from it in sleeping has"
42078,"been very great."
42078,""
42078,"I shall write soon to Catherine to fix my day, which will be Thursday."
42078,"We have no engagement but for Sunday. Eliza's cold makes quiet"
42078,"advisable. Her party is mentioned in this morning's paper. I am sorry to"
42078,"hear of poor Fanny's state. From that quarter, I suppose, is to be the"

42078,""
42078,"We sat upstairs, and had thunder and lightning as usual. I never knew"
42078,"such a spring for thunderstorms as it has been. Thank God! we have had"
42078,"no bad ones here. I thought myself in luck to have my uncomfortable"
42078,"feelings shared by the mistress of the house, as that procured blinds"
42078,"and candles. It had been excessively hot the whole day. Mrs. Harding is"
42078,"a good-looking woman, but not much like Mrs. Toke, inasmuch as she is"
42078,"very brown and has scarcely any teeth; she seems to have some of Mrs."
42078,"Toke's civility. Miss H. is an elegant, pleasing, pretty-looking girl,"
42078,"about nineteen, I suppose, or nineteen and a half, or nineteen and a"

42078,"BY this time, my dearest Cassandra, you know Martha's plans. I was"
42078,"rather disappointed, I confess, to find that she could not leave town"
42078,"till after ye 24th, as I had hoped to see you here the week before. The"
42078,"delay, however, is not great, and everything seems generally arranging"
42078,"itself for your return very comfortably."

42078,"I found Henry perfectly predisposed to bring you to London if agreeable"
42078,"to yourself; he has not fixed his day for going into Kent, but he must"
42078,"be back again before ye 20th. You may therefore think with something"
42078,"like certainty of the close of your Godmersham visit, and will have, I"
42078,"suppose, about a week for Sloane Street. He travels in his gig, and"
42078,"should the weather be tolerable I think you must have a delightful"
42078,"journey."
42078,""
42078,"I have given up all idea of Miss Sharpe's travelling with you and"
42078,"Martha, for though you are both all compliance with my scheme, yet as"
42078,"you knock off a week from the end of her visit, and Martha rather more"
42078,"from the beginning, the thing is out of the question."
42078,""
42078,"I have written to her to say that after the middle of July we shall be"
42078,"happy to receive her, and I have added a welcome if she could make her"
42078,"way hither directly, but I do not expect that she will. I have also sent"
42078,"our invitation to Cowes."

42078,"We are very sorry for the disappointment you have all had in Lady B.'s"

42078,"I had a few lines from Henry on Tuesday to prepare us for himself and"
42078,"his friend, and by the time that I had made the sumptuous provision of a"
42078,"neck of mutton on the occasion, they drove into the court; but lest you"
42078,"should not immediately recollect in how many hours a neck of mutton may"
42078,"be certainly procured, I add that they came a little after twelve,--both"
42078,"tall and well, and in their different degrees agreeable."
42078,""
42078,"It was a visit of only twenty-four hours, but very pleasant while it"
42078,"lasted. Mr. Tilson took a sketch of the Great House before dinner, and"
42078,"after dinner we all three walked to Chawton Park,[14] meaning to go into"
42078,"it, but it was too dirty, and we were obliged to keep on the outside."
42078,"Mr. Tilson admired the trees very much, but grieved that they should not"
42078,"be turned into money."
42078,""
42078,"My mother's cold is better, and I believe she only wants dry weather to"
42078,"be very well. It was a great distress to her that Anna should be absent"
42078,"during her uncle's visit, a distress which I could not share. She does"
42078,"not return from Faringdon till this evening, and I doubt not has had"
42078,"plenty of the miscellaneous, unsettled sort of happiness which seems to"
42078,"suit her best. We hear from Miss Benn, who was on the Common with the"
42078,"Prowtings, that she was very much admired by the gentlemen in general."

42078,"match, though I think they might have allowed us rather larger leaves,"
42078,"especially in such a year of fine foliage as this. One is apt to suppose"
42078,"that the woods about Birmingham must be blighted. There was no bill with"
42078,"the goods, but that shall not screen them from being paid. I mean to ask"
42078,"Martha to settle the account. It will be quite in her way, for she is"
42078,"just now sending my mother a breakfast-set from the same place."
42078,""
42078,"I hope it will come by the wagon to-morrow; it is certainly what we"
42078,"want, and I long to know what it is like, and as I am sure Martha has"
42078,"great pleasure in making the present, I will not have any regret. We"
42078,"have considerable dealings with the wagons at present: a hamper of port"
42078,"and brandy from Southampton is now in the kitchen."

42078,"like the gathering in the ""Lady of the Lake."" Yesterday I had the"
42078,"agreeable surprise of finding several scarlet strawberries quite ripe;"
42078,"had you been at home, this would have been a pleasure lost. There are"
42078,"more gooseberries and fewer currants than I thought at first. We must"

42078,"The Digweeds are gone down to see the Stephen Terrys at Southampton, and"

42078,"I had just left off writing and put on my things for walking to Alton,"
42078,"when Anna and her friend Harriot called in their way thither; so we went"
42078,"together. Their business was to provide mourning against the King's"
42078,"death, and my mother has had a bombazine bought for her. I am not sorry"
42078,"to be back again, for the young ladies had a great deal to do, and"
42078,"without much method in doing it."
42078,""
42078,"Anna does not come home till to-morrow morning. She has written I find"

42078,"book's coming, and in the evening we fairly set at it, and read half the"
42078,"first vol. to her, prefacing that, having intelligence from Henry that"
42078,"such a work would soon appear, we had desired him to send it whenever it"
42078,"came out, and I believe it passed with her unsuspected. She was amused,"
42078,"poor soul! _That_ she could not help, you know, with two such people to"

42078,"confess that I think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in"

42078,"but the difference is not so much in reality as in look, there being a"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter was truly welcome, and I am much obliged"
42078,"to you for all your praise; it came at a right time, for I had had some"
42078,"fits of disgust. Our second evening's reading to Miss B. had not"
42078,"pleased me so well, but I believe something must be attributed to my"
42078,"mother's too rapid way of getting on: though she perfectly understands"
42078,"the characters herself, she cannot speak as they ought. Upon the whole,"
42078,"however, I am quite vain enough and well satisfied enough. The work is"
42078,"rather too light and bright and sparkling: it wants shade; it wants to"
42078,"be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense, if it"
42078,"could be had; if not, of solemn specious nonsense, about something"

42078,"that you can say what you do, after having gone through the whole work,"
42078,"and Fanny's praise is very gratifying. My hopes were tolerably strong of"
42078,"her, but nothing like a certainty. Her liking Darcy and Elizabeth is"
42078,"enough. She might hate all the others, if she would. I have her opinion"
42078,"under her own hand this morning; but your transcript of it, which I read"
42078,"first, was not, and is not, the less acceptable. To me it is of course"
42078,"all praise, but the more exact truth which she sends you is good"
42078,"enough. . . . Our party on Wednesday was not unagreeable, though we"
42078,"wanted a master of the house less anxious and fidgety, and more"
42078,"conversable. Upon Mrs. ----'s mentioning that she had sent the rejected"
42078,"addresses to Mrs. H., I began talking to her a little about them, and"
42078,"expressed my hope of their having amused her. Her answer was, ""Oh dear,"
42078,"yes, very much, very droll indeed, the opening of the house, and the"
42078,"striking up of the fiddles!"" What she meant, poor woman, who shall say?"
42078,"I sought no farther. As soon as a whist-party was formed, and a round"
42078,"table threatened, I made my mother an excuse and came away, leaving just"
42078,"as many for their round table as there were at Mrs. Grant's.[16] I wish"

42078,"Police and Institutions of the British Empire,"" by Capt. Pasley of the"
42078,"Engineers,--a book which I protested against at first, but which upon"
42078,"trial I find delightfully written and highly entertaining. I am as much"
42078,"in love with the author as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even"
42078,"the two Mr. Smiths of the city. The first soldier I ever sighed for; but"
42078,"he does write with extraordinary force and spirit. Yesterday, moreover,"
42078,"brought us ""Mrs. Grant's Letters,"" with Mr. White's compliments; but I"
42078,"have disposed of them, compliments and all, to Miss P., and amongst so"
42078,"many readers or retainers of books as we have in Chawton, I dare say"
42078,"there will be no difficulty in getting rid of them for another"
42078,"fortnight, if necessary. I have disposed of Mrs. Grant for the second"
42078,"fortnight to Mrs. ----. It can make no difference to her which of the"
42078,"twenty-six fortnights in the year the three vols. lie on her table. I"
42078,"have been applied to for information as to the oath taken in former"
42078,"times of Bell, Book, and Candle, but have none to give. Perhaps you may"
42078,"be able to learn something of its origin where you now are. Ladies who"
42078,"read those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always"
42078,"sees in the breakfast-parlor there must be acquainted with everything"
42078,"in the world. I detest a quarto. Captain Pasley's book is too good for"
42078,"their society. They will not understand a man who condenses his thoughts"

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Before I say anything else, I claim a paper full of"
42078,"halfpence on the drawing-room mantelpiece; I put them there myself, and"
42078,"forgot to bring them with me. I cannot say that I have yet been in any"
42078,"distress for money, but I choose to have my due, as well as the Devil."
42078,"How lucky we were in our weather yesterday! This wet morning makes one"
42078,"more sensible of it. We had no rain of any consequence. The head of the"
42078,"curricle was put half up three or four times, but our share of the"
42078,"showers was very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy all round us,"
42078,"when we were on the Hog's-back, and I fancied it might then be raining"
42078,"so hard at Chawton as to make you feel for us much more than we"
42078,"deserved. Three hours and a quarter took us to Guildford, where we"
42078,"stayed barely two hours, and had only just time enough for all we had"
42078,"to do there; that is, eating a long and comfortable breakfast, watching"
42078,"the carriages, paying Mr. Harrington, and taking a little stroll"
42078,"afterwards. From some views which that stroll gave us, I think most"
42078,"highly of the situation of Guildford. We wanted all our brothers and"
42078,"sisters to be standing with us in the bowling-green, and looking towards"
42078,"Horsham. I was very lucky in my gloves,--got them at the first shop I"
42078,"went to, though I went into it rather because it was near than because"
42078,"it looked at all like a glove-shop, and gave only four shillings for"
42078,"them; after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting"
42078,"that they cannot be good for anything, and their worth certainly remains"
42078,"to be proved; but I think they look very well. We left Guildford at"
42078,"twenty minutes before twelve (I hope somebody cares for these minutiae),"
42078,"and were at Esher in about two hours more. I was very much pleased with"
42078,"the country in general. Between Guildford and Ripley I thought it"
42078,"particularly pretty, also about Painshill; and from a Mr. Spicer's"
42078,"grounds at Esher, which we walked into before dinner, the views were"
42078,"beautiful. I cannot say what we did _not_ see, but I should think there"
42078,"could not be a wood, or a meadow, or palace, or remarkable spot in"
42078,"England that was not spread out before us on one side or other."
42078,"Claremont is going to be sold: a Mr. Ellis has it now. It is a house"
42078,"that seems never to have prospered. After dinner we walked forward to be"
42078,"overtaken at the coachman's time, and before he did overtake us we were"
42078,"very near Kingston. I fancy it was about half-past six when we reached"
42078,"this house,--a twelve hours' business, and the horses did not appear"
42078,"more than reasonably tired. I was very tired too, and glad to get to bed"
42078,"early, but am quite well to-day. I am very snug in the front"
42078,"drawing-room all to myself, and would not say ""thank you"" for any"
42078,"company but you. The quietness of it does me good. I have contrived to"
42078,"pay my two visits, though the weather made me a great while about it,"
42078,"and left me only a few minutes to sit with Charlotte Craven.[17] She"
42078,"looks very well, and her hair is done up with an elegance to do credit"
42078,"to any education. Her manners are as unaffected and pleasing as ever."
42078,"She had heard from her mother to-day. Mrs. Craven spends another"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I am very much obliged to you for writing to me."
42078,"You must have hated it after a worrying morning. Your letter came just"
42078,"in time to save my going to Remnant's, and fit me for Christian's, where"
42078,"I bought Fanny's dimity."
42078,""
42078,"I went the day before (Friday) to Layton's as I proposed, and got my"
42078,"mother's gown,--seven yards at 6_s._ 6_d._ I then walked into No. 10,"
42078,"which is all dirt and confusion, but in a very promising way; and after"
42078,"being present at the opening of a new account, to my great amusement,"
42078,"Henry and I went to the exhibition in Spring Gardens. It is not thought"
42078,"a good collection, but I was very well pleased, particularly (pray tell"
42078,"Fanny) with a small portrait of Mrs. Bingley,[1] excessively like her."
42078,""
42078,"I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there was no Mrs."
42078,"Darcy.[18] Perhaps, however, I may find her in the great exhibition,"
42078,"which we shall go to if we have time. I have no chance of her in the"
42078,"collection of Sir Joshua Reynolds's paintings, which is now showing in"
42078,"Pall Mall, and which we are also to visit."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Bingley's is exactly herself,--size, shaped face, features, and"
42078,"sweetness; there never was a greater likeness. She is dressed in a white"
42078,"gown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always"
42078,"supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I dare say Mrs. D."
42078,"will be in yellow."
42078,""
42078,"Friday was our worst day as to weather. We were out in a very long and"
42078,"very heavy storm of hail, and there had been others before, but I heard"
42078,"no thunder. Saturday was a good deal better; dry and cold."
42078,""
42078,"I gave 2_s._ 6_d._ for the dimity. I do not boast of any bargains, but"
42078,"think both the sarsenet and dimity good of their sort."
42078,""
42078,"I have bought your locket, but was obliged to give 18_s._ for it, which"
42078,"must be rather more than you intended. It is neat and plain, set in"
42078,"gold."
42078,""
42078,"We were to have gone to the Somerset House Exhibition on Saturday, but"
42078,"when I reached Henrietta Street Mr. Hampson was wanted there, and Mr."
42078,"Tilson and I were obliged to drive about town after him, and by the time"
42078,"we had done it was too late for anything but home. We never found him"
42078,"after all."
42078,""
42078,"I have been interrupted by Mrs. Tilson. Poor woman! She is in danger of"
42078,"not being able to attend Lady Drummond Smith's party to-night. Miss"
42078,"Burdett was to have taken her, and now Miss Burdett has a cough and"
42078,"will not go. My cousin Caroline is her sole dependence."
42078,""
42078,"The events of yesterday were, our going to Belgrave Chapel in the"
42078,"morning, our being prevented by the rain from going to evening service"
42078,"at St. James, Mr. Hampson's calling, Messrs. Barlow and Phillips dining"
42078,"here, and Mr. and Mrs. Tilson's coming in the evening _a l'ordinaire_."
42078,"She drank tea with us both Thursday and Saturday; he dined out each day,"
42078,"and on Friday we were with them, and they wish us to go to them"
42078,"to-morrow evening, to meet Miss Burdett, but I do not know how it will"
42078,"end. Henry talks of a drive to Hampstead, which may interfere with it."
42078,""
42078,"I should like to see Miss Burdett very well, but that I am rather"
42078,"frightened by hearing that she wishes to be introduced to me. If I am a"
42078,"wild beast, I cannot help it. It is not my own fault."
42078,""
42078,"There is no change in our plan of leaving London, but we shall not be"
42078,"with you before Tuesday. Henry thinks Monday would appear too early a"
42078,"day. There is no danger of our being induced to stay longer."
42078,""
42078,"I have not quite determined how I shall manage about my clothes; perhaps"
42078,"there may be only my trunk to send by the coach, or there may be a"
42078,"band-box with it. I have taken your gentle hint, and written to Mrs."
42078,"Hill."
42078,""
42078,"The Hoblyns want us to dine with them, but we have refused. When Henry"
42078,"returns he will be dining out a great deal, I dare say; as he will then"
42078,"be alone, it will be more desirable; he will be more welcome at every"
42078,"table, and every invitation more welcome to him. He will not want either"
42078,"of us again till he is settled in Henrietta Street. This is my present"
42078,"persuasion. And he will not be settled there--really settled--till late"
42078,"in the autumn; ""he will not be come to bide"" till after September."
42078,""
42078,"There is a gentleman in treaty for this house. Gentleman himself is in"
42078,"the country, but gentleman's friend came to see it the other day, and"
42078,"seemed pleased on the whole. Gentleman would rather prefer an increased"
42078,"rent to parting with five hundred guineas at once, and if that is the"
42078,"only difficulty it will not be minded. Henry is indifferent as to the"
42078,"which."
42078,""
42078,"Get us the best weather you can for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We"
42078,"are to go to Windsor in our way to Henley, which will be a great"
42078,"delight. We shall be leaving Sloane Street about twelve, two or three"
42078,"hours after Charles's party have begun their journey. You will miss"
42078,"them, but the comfort of getting back into your own room will be great."
42078,"And then the tea and sugar!"
42078,""
42078,"I fear Miss Clewes is not better, or you would have mentioned it. I"
42078,"shall not write again unless I have any unexpected communication or"
42078,"opportunity to tempt me. I enclose Mr. Herington's bill and receipt."
42078,""
42078,"I am very much obliged to Fanny for her letter; it made me laugh"
42078,"heartily, but I cannot pretend to answer it. Even had I more time, I"
42078,"should not feel at all sure of the sort of letter that Miss D.[19] would"
42078,"write. I hope Miss Benn is got well again, and will have a comfortable"
42078,"dinner with you to-day."
42078,""
42078,"_Monday Evening._--We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J."
42078,"Reynolds's, and I am disappointed, for there was nothing like Mrs. D. at"
42078,"either. I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too"
42078,"much to like it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine he"
42078,"would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of love, pride, and"
42078,"delicacy."
42078,""
42078,"Setting aside this disappointment, I had great amusement among the"
42078,"pictures; and the driving about, the carriage being open, was very"
42078,"pleasant. I liked my solitary elegance very much, and was ready to laugh"
42078,"all the time at my being where I was. I could not but feel that I had"
42078,"naturally small right to be parading about London in a barouche."
42078,""
42078,"Henry desires Edward may know that he has just bought three dozen of"
42078,"claret for him (cheap), and ordered it to be sent down to Chawton."
42078,""
42078,"I should not wonder if we got no farther than Reading on Thursday"
42078,"evening, and so reach Steventon only to a reasonable dinner-hour the"
42078,"next day; but whatever I may write or you may imagine, we know it will"
42078,"be something different. I shall be quiet to-morrow morning; all my"
42078,"business is done, and I shall only call again upon Mrs. Hoblyn, etc."
42078,""
42078,"Love to your much . . . party."
42078,""
42078,"                                  Yours affectionately,"

42078,"                         HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (Sept. 15, 1/2 past 8)."
42078,""
42078,"HERE I am, my dearest Cassandra, seated in the breakfast, dining,"
42078,"sitting room, beginning with all my might. Fanny will join me as soon as"
42078,"she is dressed, and begin her letter."
42078,""
42078,"We had a very good journey, weather and roads excellent; the three first"
42078,"stages for 1_s._ 6_d._, and our only misadventure the being delayed"
42078,"about a quarter of an hour at Kingston for horses, and being obliged to"
42078,"put up with a pair belonging to a hackney coach and their coachman,"
42078,"which left no room on the barouche box for Lizzy, who was to have gone"
42078,"her last stage there as she did the first; consequently we were all"
42078,"four within, which was a little crowded."
42078,""
42078,"We arrived at a quarter-past four, and were kindly welcomed by the"
42078,"coachman, and then by his master, and then by William, and then by Mrs."
42078,"Pengird, who all met us before we reached the foot of the stairs. Mde."
42078,"Bigion was below dressing us a most comfortable dinner of soup, fish,"
42078,"bouillee, partridges, and an apple tart, which we sat down to soon after"
42078,"five, after cleaning and dressing ourselves, and feeling that we were"
42078,"most commodiously disposed of. The little adjoining dressing-room to our"
42078,"apartment makes Fanny and myself very well off indeed, and as we have"
42078,"poor Eliza's[20] bed our space is ample every way."
42078,""
42078,"Sace arrived safely about half-past six. At seven we set off in a coach"
42078,"for the Lyceum; were at home again in about four hours and a half; had"
42078,"soup and wine and water, and then went to our holes."
42078,""
42078,"Edward finds his quarters very snug and quiet. I must get a softer pen."
42078,"This is harder. I am in agonies. I have not yet seen Mr. Crabbe."
42078,"Martha's letter is gone to the post."
42078,""
42078,"I am going to write nothing but short sentences. There shall be two full"
42078,"stops in every line. Layton and Shear's is Bedford House. We mean to"
42078,"get there before breakfast if it's possible; for we feel more and more"
42078,"how much we have to do and how little time. This house looks very nice."
42078,"It seems like Sloane Street moved here. I believe Henry is just rid of"
42078,"Sloane Street. Fanny does not come, but I have Edward seated by me"
42078,"beginning a letter, which looks natural."
42078,""
42078,"Henry has been suffering from the pain in the face which he has been"
42078,"subject to before. He caught cold at Matlock, and since his return has"
42078,"been paying a little for past pleasure. It is nearly removed now, but he"
42078,"looks thin in the face, either from the pain or the fatigues of his"
42078,"tour, which must have been great."
42078,""
42078,"Lady Robert is delighted with P. and P.,[21] and really was so, as I"
42078,"understand, before she knew who wrote it, for of course she knows now."
42078,"He told her with as much satisfaction as if it were my wish. He did not"
42078,"tell me this, but he told Fanny. And Mr. Hastings! I am quite delighted"
42078,"with what such a man writes about it. Henry sent him the books after his"
42078,"return from Daylesford, but you will hear the letter too."
42078,""
42078,"Let me be rational, and return to my two full stops."
42078,""
42078,"I talked to Henry at the play last night. We were in a private box,--Mr."
42078,"Spencer's,--which made it much more pleasant. The box is directly on"
42078,"the stage. One is infinitely less fatigued than in the common way. But"
42078,"Henry's plans are not what one could wish. He does not mean to be at"
42078,"Chawton till the 29th. He must be in town again by Oct. 5. His plan is"
42078,"to get a couple of days of pheasant shooting and then return directly."
42078,"His wish was to bring you back with him. I have told him your scruples."
42078,"He wishes you to suit yourself as to time, and if you cannot come till"
42078,"later, will send for you at any time as far as Bagshot. He presumed you"
42078,"would not find difficulty in getting so far. I could not say you would."
42078,"He proposed your going with him into Oxfordshire. It was his own thought"
42078,"at first. I could not but catch at it for you."
42078,""
42078,"We have talked of it again this morning (for now we have breakfasted),"
42078,"and I am convinced that if you can make it suit in other respects you"
42078,"need not scruple on his account. If you cannot come back with him on the"
42078,"3rd or 4th, therefore, I do hope you will contrive to go to Adlestrop."
42078,"By not beginning your absence till about the middle of this month I"
42078,"think you may manage it very well. But you will think all this over. One"
42078,"could wish he had intended to come to you earlier, but it cannot be"
42078,"helped."
42078,""
42078,"I said nothing to him of Mrs. H. and Miss B., that he might not suppose"
42078,"difficulties. Shall not you put them into our own room? This seems to"
42078,"me the best plan, and the maid will be most conveniently near."
42078,""
42078,"Oh, dear me! when I shall ever have done. We did go to Layton and"
42078,"Shear's before breakfast. Very pretty English poplins at 4_s._ 3_d._;"
42078,"Irish, ditto at 6_s._; more pretty, certainly,--beautiful."
42078,""
42078,"Fanny and the two little girls are gone to take places for to-night at"
42078,"Covent Garden; ""Clandestine Marriage"" and ""Midas."" The latter will be a"
42078,"fine show for L. and M.[22] They revelled last night in ""Don Juan,"" whom"
42078,"we left in hell at half-past eleven. We had scaramouch and a ghost, and"
42078,"were delighted. I speak of them; my delight was very tranquil, and the"
42078,"rest of us were sober-minded. ""Don Juan"" was the last of three musical"
42078,"things. ""Five Hours at Brighton,"" in three acts,--of which one was over"
42078,"before we arrived, none the worse,--and the ""Beehive,"" rather less flat"
42078,"and trumpery."
42078,""
42078,"I have this moment received 5_l._ from kind, beautiful Edward. Fanny has"
42078,"a similar gift. I shall save what I can of it for your better leisure in"
42078,"this place. My letter was from Miss Sharpe,--nothing particular. A"
42078,"letter from Fanny Cage this morning."
42078,""
42078,"_Four o'clock._--We are just come back from doing Mrs. Tickars, Miss"
42078,"Hare, and Mr. Spence. Mr. Hall is here, and while Fanny is under his"
42078,"hands, I will try to write a little more."
42078,""
42078,"Miss Hare had some pretty caps, and is to make me one like one of them,"
42078,"only white satin instead of blue. It will be white satin and lace, and a"
42078,"little white flower perking out of the left ear, like Harriot Byron's"
42078,"feather. I have allowed her to go as far as 1_l._ 16_s._ My gown is to"
42078,"be trimmed everywhere with white ribbon plaited on somehow or other. She"
42078,"says it will look well. I am not sanguine. They trim with white very"
42078,"much."
42078,""
42078,"I learnt from Mrs. Tickars's young lady, to my high amusement, that the"
42078,"stays now are not made to force the bosom up at all; that was a very"
42078,"unbecoming, unnatural fashion. I was really glad to hear that they are"
42078,"not to be so much off the shoulders as they were."
42078,""
42078,"Going to Mr. Spence's was a sad business, and cost us many tears;"
42078,"unluckily we were obliged to go a second time before he could do more"
42078,"than just look. We went first at half-past twelve and afterwards at"
42078,"three; papa with us each time; and, alas! we are to go again to-morrow."
42078,"Lizzy is not finished yet. There have been no teeth taken out, however,"
42078,"nor will be, I believe; but he finds hers in a very bad state, and seems"
42078,"to think particularly ill of their durableness. They have been all"
42078,"cleaned, hers filed, and are to be filed again. There is a very sad hole"
42078,"between two of her front teeth."
42078,""
42078,"_Thursday Morning, half-past Seven._--Up and dressed and downstairs in"
42078,"order to finish my letter in time for the parcel. At eight I have an"
42078,"appointment with Madame B., who wants to show me something downstairs."
42078,"At nine we are to set off for Grafton House, and get that over before"
42078,"breakfast. Edward is so kind as to walk there with us. We are to be at"
42078,"Mr. Spence's again at 11.5: from that time shall be driving about I"
42078,"suppose till four o'clock at least. We are, if possible, to call on Mrs."
42078,"Tilson."
42078,""
42078,"Mr. Hall was very punctual yesterday, and curled me out at a great rate."
42078,"I thought it looked hideous, and longed for a snug cap instead, but my"
42078,"companions silenced me by their admiration. I had only a bit of velvet"
42078,"round my head. I did not catch cold, however. The weather is all in my"
42078,"favor. I have had no pain in my face since I left you."
42078,""
42078,"We had very good places in the box next the stage-box, front and second"
42078,"row; the three old ones behind, of course. I was particularly"
42078,"disappointed at seeing nothing of Mr. Crabbe. I felt sure of him when I"
42078,"saw that the boxes were fitted up with crimson velvet. The new Mr. Terry"
42078,"was Lord Ogleby, and Henry thinks he may do; but there was no acting"
42078,"more than moderate, and I was as much amused by the remembrances"
42078,"connected with ""Midas"" as with any part of it. The girls were very much"
42078,"delighted, but still prefer ""Don Juan;"" and I must say that I have seen"
42078,"nobody on the stage who has been a more interesting character than that"
42078,"compound of cruelty and lust."
42078,""
42078,"It was not possible for me to get the worsteds yesterday. I heard Edward"
42078,"last night pressing Henry to come to you, and I think Henry engaged to"
42078,"go there after his November collection. Nothing has been done as to S."
42078,"and S.[23] The books came to hand too late for him to have time for it"
42078,"before he went. Mr. Hastings never hinted at Eliza in the smallest"
42078,"degree. Henry knew nothing of Mr. Trimmer's death. I tell you these"
42078,"things that you may not have to ask them over again."
42078,""
42078,"There is a new clerk sent down to Alton, a Mr. Edmund Williams, a young"
42078,"man whom Henry thinks most highly of, and he turns out to be a son of"
42078,"the luckless Williamses of Grosvenor Place."
42078,""
42078,"I long to have you hear Mr. H.'s opinion of P. and P. His admiring my"
42078,"Elizabeth so much is particularly welcome to me."
42078,""
42078,"Instead of saving my superfluous wealth for you to spend, I am going to"
42078,"treat myself with spending it myself. I hope, at least, that I shall"
42078,"find some poplin at Layton and Shear's that will tempt me to buy it. If"
42078,"I do, it shall be sent to Chawton, as half will be for you; for I depend"
42078,"upon your being so kind as to accept it, being the main point. It will"
42078,"be a great pleasure to me. Don't say a word. I only wish you could"
42078,"choose too. I shall send twenty yards."
42078,""
42078,"Now for Bath. Poor F. Cage has suffered a good deal from her accident."
42078,"The noise of the White Hart was terrible to her. They will keep her"
42078,"quiet, I dare say. She is not so much delighted with the place as the"
42078,"rest of the party; probably, as she says herself, from having been less"
42078,"well, but she thinks she should like it better in the season. The"
42078,"streets are very empty now, and the shops not so gay as she expected."
42078,"They are at No. 1 Henrietta Street, the corner of Laura Place, and have"
42078,"no acquaintance at present but the Bramstons."
42078,""
42078,"Lady Bridges drinks at the Cross Bath, her son at the Hot, and Louisa is"
42078,"going to bathe. Dr. Parry seems to be half starving Mr. Bridges, for he"
42078,"is restricted to much such a diet as James's, bread, water and meat, and"
42078,"is never to eat so much of that as he wishes, and he is to walk a great"
42078,"deal,--walk till he drops, I believe,--gout or no gout. It really is to"
42078,"that purpose. I have not exaggerated."
42078,""
42078,"Charming weather for you and us, and the travellers, and everybody. You"

42078,"THANK you, my dearest Cassandra, for the nice long letter I sent off"
42078,"this morning. I hope you have had it by this time, and that it has found"
42078,"you all well, and my mother no more in need of leeches. Whether this"
42078,"will be delivered to you by Henry on Saturday evening, or by the postman"
42078,"on Sunday morning, I know not, as he has lately recollected something of"
42078,"an engagement for Saturday, which perhaps may delay his visit. He seems"
42078,"determined to come to you soon, however."
42078,""
42078,"I hope you will receive the gown to-morrow, and may be able with"
42078,"tolerable honesty to say that you like the color. It was bought at"
42078,"Grafton House, where, by going very early, we got immediate attendance"
42078,"and went on very comfortably. I only forgot the one particular thing"
42078,"which I had always resolved to buy there,--a white silk"
42078,"handkerchief,--and was therefore obliged to give six shillings for one"
42078,"at Crook and Besford's; which reminds me to say that the worsteds ought"
42078,"also to be at Chawton to-morrow, and that I shall be very happy to hear"
42078,"they are approved. I had not much time for deliberation."
42078,""
42078,"We are now all four of us young ladies sitting round the circular table"
42078,"in the inner room writing our letters, while the two brothers are"
42078,"having a comfortable coze in the room adjoining. It is to be a quiet"
42078,"evening, much to the satisfaction of four of the six. My eyes are quite"
42078,"tired of dust and lamps."
42078,""
42078,"The letter you forwarded from Edward, junr., has been duly received. He"
42078,"has been shooting most prosperously at home, and dining at Chilham"
42078,"Castle and with Mr. Scudamore."
42078,""
42078,"My cap is come home, and I like it very much. Fanny has one also; hers"
42078,"is white sarsenet and lace, of a different shape from mine, more fit for"
42078,"morning carriage wear, which is what it is intended for, and is in shape"
42078,"exceedingly like our own satin and lace of last winter; shaped round the"
42078,"face exactly like it, with pipes and more fulness, and a round crown"
42078,"inserted behind. My cap has a peak in front. Large full bows of very"
42078,"narrow ribbon (old twopenny) are the thing. One over the right temple,"
42078,"perhaps, and another at the left ear."
42078,""
42078,"Henry is not quite well. His stomach is rather deranged. You must keep"
42078,"him in rhubarb, and give him plenty of port and water. He caught his"
42078,"cold farther back than I told you,--before he got to Matlock, somewhere"
42078,"in his journey from the North; but the ill effects of that I hope are"
42078,"nearly gone."
42078,""
42078,"We returned from Grafton House only just in time for breakfast, and had"
42078,"scarcely finished breakfast when the carriage came to the door. From"
42078,"eleven to half-past three we were hard at it; we did contrive to get to"
42078,"Hans Place for ten minutes. Mrs. T. was as affectionate and pleasing as"
42078,"ever."
42078,""
42078,"After our return Mr. Tilson walked up from the Compting House and called"
42078,"upon us, and these have been all our visitings."
42078,""
42078,"I have rejoiced more than once that I bought my writing-paper in the"
42078,"country; we have not had a quarter of an hour to spare."
42078,""
42078,"I enclose the eighteen-pence due to my mother. The rose color was 6_s._"
42078,"and the other 4_s._ per yard. There was but two yards and a quarter of"
42078,"the dark slate in the shop, but the man promised to match it and send it"
42078,"off correctly."
42078,""
42078,"Fanny bought her Irish at Newton's in Leicester Square, and I took the"
42078,"opportunity of thinking about your Irish, and seeing one piece of the"
42078,"yard wide at 4_s._, and it seemed to me very good; good enough for your"
42078,"purpose. It might at least be worth your while to go there, if you have"
42078,"no other engagements. Fanny is very much pleased with the stockings she"
42078,"has bought of Remmington, silk at 12_s._, cotton at 4_s._ 3_d._ She"
42078,"thinks them great bargains, but I have not seen them yet, as my hair was"
42078,"dressing when the man and the stockings came."
42078,""
42078,"The poor girls and their teeth! I have not mentioned them yet, but we"
42078,"were a whole hour at Spence's, and Lizzy's were filed and lamented over"
42078,"again, and poor Marianne had two taken out after all, the two just"
42078,"beyond the eye teeth, to make room for those in front. When her doom was"
42078,"fixed, Fanny, Lizzy, and I walked into the next room, where we heard"
42078,"each of the two sharp and hasty screams."
42078,""
42078,"The little girls' teeth I can suppose in a critical state, but I think"
42078,"he must be a lover of teeth and money and mischief, to parade about"
42078,"Fanny's. I would not have had him look at mine for a shilling a tooth"
42078,"and double it. It was a disagreeable hour."
42078,""
42078,"We then went to Wedgwood's, where my brother and Fanny chose a"
42078,"dinner-set. I believe the pattern is a small lozenge in purple, between"
42078,"lines of narrow gold, and it is to have the crest."
42078,""
42078,"We must have been three-quarters of an hour at Grafton House, Edward"
42078,"sitting by all the time with wonderful patience. There Fanny bought the"
42078,"net for Anna's gown, and a beautiful square veil for herself. The edging"
42078,"there is very cheap. I was tempted by some, and I bought some very nice"
42078,"plaiting lace at 3_s._ 4_d._"
42078,""
42078,"Fanny desires me to tell Martha, with her kind love, that Birchall"
42078,"assured her there was no second set of Hook's Lessons for Beginners, and"
42078,"that, by my advice, she has therefore chosen her a set by another"
42078,"composer. I thought she would rather have something than not. It costs"
42078,"six shillings."
42078,""
42078,"With love to you all, including Triggs, I remain,"
42078,""
42078,"                            Yours very affectionately,       J. AUSTEN."

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Thank you five hundred and forty times for the"
42078,"exquisite piece of workmanship which was brought into the room this"
42078,"morning, while we were at breakfast, with some very inferior works of"
42078,"art in the same way, and which I read with high glee, much delighted"
42078,"with everything it told, whether good or bad. It is so rich in striking"
42078,"intelligence that I hardly know what to reply to first. I believe finery"
42078,"must have it."
42078,""
42078,"I am extremely glad that you like the poplin. I thought it would have my"
42078,"mother's approbation, but was not so confident of yours. Remember that"
42078,"it is a present. Do not refuse me. I am very rich."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Clement is very welcome to her little boy, and to my"
42078,"congratulations into the bargain, if ever you think of giving them. I"
42078,"hope she will do well. Her sister in Lucina, Mrs. H. Gipps, does too"
42078,"well, we think. Mary P. wrote on Sunday that she had been three days on"
42078,"the sofa. Sackree does not approve it."
42078,""
42078,"Well, there is some comfort in the Mrs. Hulbart's not coming to you, and"
42078,"I am happy to hear of the honey. I was thinking of it the other day. Let"
42078,"me know when you begin the new tea and the new white wine. My present"
42078,"elegances have not yet made me indifferent to such matters. I am still a"
42078,"cat if I see a mouse."
42078,""
42078,"I am glad you like our caps, but Fanny is out of conceit with hers"
42078,"already; she finds that she has been buying a new cap without having a"
42078,"new pattern, which is true enough. She is rather out of luck to like"
42078,"neither her gown nor her cap, but I do not much mind it, because besides"
42078,"that I like them both myself, I consider it as a thing of course at her"
42078,"time of life,--one of the sweet taxes of youth to choose in a hurry and"
42078,"make bad bargains."
42078,""
42078,"I wrote to Charles yesterday, and Fanny has had a letter from him"
42078,"to-day, principally to make inquiries about the time of their visit"
42078,"here, to which mine was an answer beforehand; so he will probably write"
42078,"again soon to fix his week. I am best pleased that Cassy does not go to"
42078,"you."
42078,""
42078,"Now, what have we been doing since I wrote last? The Mr. K.'s[24] came a"
42078,"little before dinner on Monday, and Edward went to the church with the"
42078,"two seniors, but there is no inscription yet drawn up. They are very"
42078,"good-natured, you know, and civil, and all that, but are not"
42078,"particularly superfine; however, they ate their dinner and drank their"
42078,"tea, and went away, leaving their lovely Wadham in our arms, and I wish"
42078,"you had seen Fanny and me running backwards and forwards with his"
42078,"breeches from the little chintz to the white room before we went to bed,"
42078,"in the greatest of frights lest he should come upon us before we had"
42078,"done it all. There had been a mistake in the housemaid's preparation,"
42078,"and they were gone to bed."
42078,""
42078,"He seems a very harmless sort of young man, nothing to like or dislike"
42078,"in him,--goes out shooting or hunting with the two others all the"
42078,"morning, and plays at whist and makes queer faces in the evening. . . ."

42078,"[MY DEAREST AUNT CASS.,--I have just asked Aunt Jane to let me write a"
42078,"little in her letter, but she does not like it, so I won't. Good-by!]"
42078,""
42078,"You will have Edward's letter to-morrow. He tells me that he did not"
42078,"send you any news to interfere with mine, but I do not think there is"
42078,"much for anybody to send at present."
42078,""
42078,"We had our dinner-party on Wednesday, with the addition of Mrs. and Miss"
42078,"Milles, who were under a promise of dining here in their return from"
42078,"Eastwell, whenever they paid their visit of duty there, and it happened"
42078,"to be paid on that day. Both mother and daughter are much as I have"
42078,"always found them. I like the mother--first, because she reminds me of"
42078,"Mrs. Birch; and, secondly, because she is cheerful and grateful for what"
42078,"she is at the age of ninety and upwards. The day was pleasant enough. I"
42078,"sat by Mr. Chisholme, and we talked away at a great rate about nothing"
42078,"worth hearing."
42078,""
42078,"It was a mistake as to the day of the Sherers going being fixed; they"
42078,"are ready, but are waiting for Mr. Paget's answer."
42078,""
42078,"I inquired of Mrs. Milles after Jemima Brydges, and was quite grieved to"
42078,"hear that she was obliged to leave Canterbury some months ago on account"
42078,"of her debts, and is nobody knows where. What an unprosperous family!"
42078,""
42078,"On Saturday, soon after breakfast, Mr. J. P. left us for Norton Court. I"
42078,"like him very much. He gives me the idea of a very amiable young man,"
42078,"only too diffident to be so agreeable as he might be. He was out the"
42078,"chief of each morning with the other two, shooting and getting wet"
42078,"through. To-morrow we are to know whether he and a hundred young ladies"
42078,"will come here for the ball. I do not much expect any."
42078,""
42078,"The Deedes cannot meet us; they have engagements at home. I will finish"
42078,"the Deedes by saying that they are not likely to come here till quite"
42078,"late in my stay,--the very last week perhaps; and I do not expect to see"
42078,"the Moores at all. They are not solicited till after Edward's return"
42078,"from Hampshire."
42078,""
42078,"Monday, November 15, is the day now fixed for our setting out."
42078,""
42078,"Poor Basingstoke races! There seem to have been two particularly"
42078,"wretched days on purpose for them; and Weyhill week does not begin much"
42078,"happier."
42078,""
42078,"We were quite surprised by a letter from Anna at Tollard Royal, last"
42078,"Saturday; but perfectly approve her going, and only regret they should"
42078,"all go so far to stay so few days."
42078,""
42078,"We had thunder and lightning here on Thursday morning, between five and"
42078,"seven; no very bad thunder, but a great deal of lightning. It has given"
42078,"the commencement of a season of wind and rain, and perhaps for the next"
42078,"six weeks we shall not have two dry days together."
42078,""
42078,"Lizzy is very much obliged to you for your letter and will answer it"
42078,"soon, but has so many things to do that it may be four or five days"
42078,"before she can. This is quite her own message, spoken in rather a"
42078,"desponding tone. Your letter gave pleasure to all of us; we had all the"
42078,"reading of it of course,--I three times, as I undertook, to the great"
42078,"relief of Lizzy, to read it to Sackree, and afterwards to Louisa."
42078,""
42078,"Sackree does not at all approve of Mary Doe and her nuts,--on the score"
42078,"of propriety rather than health. She saw some signs of going after her"
42078,"in George and Henry, and thinks if you could give the girl a check, by"
42078,"rather reproving her for taking anything seriously about nuts which they"
42078,"said to her, it might be of use. This, of course, is between our three"
42078,"discreet selves, a scene of triennial bliss."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Breton called here on Saturday. I never saw her before. She is a"
42078,"large, ungenteel woman, with self-satisfied and would-be elegant"
42078,"manners."
42078,""
42078,"We are certain of some visitors to-morrow. Edward Bridges comes for two"
42078,"nights in his way from Lenham to Ramsgate, and brings a friend--name"
42078,"unknown--but supposed to be a Mr. Harpur, a neighboring clergyman; and"
42078,"Mr. R. Mascall is to shoot with the young men, which it is to be"
42078,"supposed will end in his staying dinner."
42078,""
42078,"On Thursday, Mr. Lushington, M.P. for Canterbury, and manager of the"
42078,"Lodge Hounds, dines here, and stays the night. He is chiefly young"
42078,"Edward's acquaintance. If I can I will get a frank from him, and write"
42078,"to you all the sooner. I suppose the Ashford ball will furnish"
42078,"something."
42078,""
42078,"As I wrote of my nephews with a little bitterness in my last, I think"
42078,"it particularly incumbent on me to do them justice now, and I have great"
42078,"pleasure in saying that they were both at the Sacrament yesterday. After"
42078,"having much praised or much blamed anybody, one is generally sensible of"
42078,"something just the reverse soon afterwards. Now these two boys who are"
42078,"out with the foxhounds will come home and disgust me again by some habit"
42078,"of luxury or some proof of sporting mania, unless I keep it off by this"
42078,"prediction. They amuse themselves very comfortably in the evening by"
42078,"netting; they are each about a rabbit net, and sit as deedily to it,"
42078,"side by side, as any two Uncle Franks could do."
42078,""
42078,"I am looking over ""Self-Control"" again, and my opinion is confirmed of"
42078,"its being an excellently meant, elegantly written work, without anything"
42078,"of nature or probability in it. I declare I do not know whether Laura's"
42078,"passage down the American river is not the most natural, possible,"
42078,"every-day thing she ever does."
42078,""
42078,"_Tuesday._--Dear me! what is to become of me? Such a long letter!"
42078,"Two-and-forty lines in the second page. Like Harriot Byron, I ask, what"
42078,"am I to do with my gratitude? I can do nothing but thank you and go on."
42078,"A few of your inquiries, I think, are replied to _en avance_."
42078,""
42078,"The name of F. Cage's drawing-master is O'Neil. We are exceedingly"
42078,"amused with your Shalden news, and your self-reproach on the subject of"
42078,"Mrs. Stockwell made me laugh heartily. I rather wondered that"
42078,"Johncock,[25] the only person in the room, could help laughing too. I had"
42078,"not heard before of her having the measles. Mrs. H. and Alethea's"
42078,"staying till Friday was quite new to me; a good plan, however. I could"
42078,"not have settled it better myself, and am glad they found so much in the"
42078,"house to approve, and I hope they will ask Martha to visit them. I"
42078,"admire the sagacity and taste of Charlotte Williams. Those large dark"
42078,"eyes always judge well. I will compliment her by naming a heroine after"
42078,"her."
42078,""
42078,"Edward has had all the particulars of the building, etc., read to him"
42078,"twice over, and seems very well satisfied. A narrow door to the pantry"
42078,"is the only subject of solicitude; it is certainly just the door which"
42078,"should not be narrow, on account of the trays; but if a case of"
42078,"necessity, it must be borne."
42078,""
42078,"I knew there was sugar in the tin, but had no idea of there being enough"
42078,"to last through your company. All the better. You ought not to think"
42078,"this new loaf better than the other, because that was the first of five"
42078,"which all came together. Something of fancy, perhaps, and something of"
42078,"imagination."
42078,""
42078,"Dear Mrs. Digweed! I cannot bear that she should not be foolishly happy"
42078,"after a ball. I hope Miss Yates and her companions were all well the day"
42078,"after their arrival. I am thoroughly rejoiced that Miss Benn has placed"
42078,"herself in lodgings, though I hope they may not be long necessary."

42078,""
42078,"Here am I in Kent, with one brother in the same county and another"
42078,"brother's wife, and see nothing of them, which seems unnatural. It will"
42078,"not last so forever, I trust. I should like to have Mrs. F. A. and her"

42078,"breathed. I wish her last visit had not been so long a one."
42078,""
42078,"I wonder whether Mrs. Tilson has ever lain-in. Mention it if it ever"

42078,""
42078,"Mr. Rob. Mascall breakfasted here; he eats a great deal of butter. I"

42078,"should be of the usual width,--if it must be contracted on one side, by"
42078,"widening it on the other. The appearance need not signify. And he"

42078,"the seal in the proper place. When I have followed up my last with this"
42078,"I shall feel somewhat less unworthy of you than the state of our"
42078,"correspondence now requires."
42078,""
42078,"I left off in a great hurry to prepare for our morning visits. Of course"
42078,"was ready a good deal the first, and need not have hurried so much."
42078,"Fanny wore her new gown and cap. I was surprised to find Mystole so"
42078,"pretty."
42078,""
42078,"The ladies were at home. I was in luck, and saw Lady Fagg and all her"
42078,"five daughters, with an old Mrs. Hamilton, from Canterbury, and Mrs. and"
42078,"Miss Chapman, from Margate, into the bargain. I never saw so plain a"
42078,"family,--five sisters so very plain! They are as plain as the Foresters,"
42078,"or the Franfraddops, or the Seagraves, or the Rivers, excluding Sophy."
42078,"Miss Sally Fagg has a pretty figure, and that comprises all the good"
42078,"looks of the family."
42078,""
42078,"It was stupidish; Fanny did her part very well, but there was a lack of"
42078,"talk altogether, and the three friends in the house only sat by and"
42078,"looked at us. However, Miss Chapman's name is Laura, and she had a"
42078,"double flounce to her gown. You really must get some flounces. Are not"
42078,"some of your large stock of white morning gowns just in a happy state"
42078,"for a flounce--too short? Nobody at home at either house in Chilham."
42078,""
42078,"Edward Bridges and his friend did not forget to arrive. The friend is a"
42078,"Mr. Wigram, one of the three-and-twenty children of a great rich"
42078,"mercantile, Sir Robert Wigram, an old acquaintance of the Footes, but"
42078,"very recently known to Edward B. The history of his coming here is,"
42078,"that, intending to go from Ramsgate to Brighton, Edw. B. persuaded him"
42078,"to take Lenham on his way, which gave him the convenience of Mr. W.'s"
42078,"gig, and the comfort of not being alone there; but, probably thinking a"
42078,"few days of Gm. would be the cheapest and pleasantest way of"
42078,"entertaining his friend and himself, offered a visit here, and here they"
42078,"stay till to-morrow."
42078,""
42078,"Mr. W. is about five or six-and-twenty, not ill-looking, and not"
42078,"agreeable. He is certainly no addition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike"
42078,"manner, but very silent. They say his name is Henry, a proof how"
42078,"unequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed. I have seen many a John and"
42078,"Thomas much more agreeable."
42078,""
42078,"We have got rid of Mr. R. Mascall, however. I did not like him, either."
42078,"He talks too much, and is conceited, besides having a vulgarly shaped"
42078,"mouth. He slept here on Tuesday, so that yesterday Fanny and I sat down"
42078,"to breakfast with six gentlemen to admire us."
42078,""
42078,"We did not go to the ball. It was left to her to decide, and at last she"
42078,"determined against it. She knew that it would be a sacrifice on the part"
42078,"of her father and brothers if they went, and I hope it will prove that"
42078,"she has not sacrificed much. It is not likely that there should have"
42078,"been anybody there whom she would care for. I was very glad to be spared"
42078,"the trouble of dressing and going, and being weary before it was half"
42078,"over; so my gown and my cap are still unworn. It will appear at last,"
42078,"perhaps, that I might have done without either. I produced my brown"
42078,"bombazine yesterday, and it was very much admired indeed, and I like it"
42078,"better than ever."
42078,""
42078,"You have given many particulars of the state of Chawton House, but still"
42078,"we want more. Edward wants to be expressly told that all the round"
42078,"tower, etc., is entirely down, and the door from the best room stopped"
42078,"up; he does not know enough of the appearance of things in that quarter."
42078,""
42078,"He heard from Bath yesterday. Lady B. continues very well, and Dr."
42078,"Parry's opinion is, that while the water agrees with her she ought to"
42078,"remain there, which throws their coming away at a greater uncertainty"
42078,"than we had supposed. It will end, perhaps, in a fit of the gout, which"
42078,"may prevent her coming away. Louisa thinks her mother's being so well"
42078,"may be quite as much owing to her being so much out of doors as to the"
42078,"water. Lady B. is going to try the hot pump, the Cross bath being about"
42078,"to be painted. Louisa is particularly well herself, and thinks the water"
42078,"has been of use to her. She mentioned our inquiries, etc., to Mr. and"
42078,"Mrs. Alex. Evelyn, and had their best compliments and thanks to give in"
42078,"return. Dr. Parry does not expect Mr. E. to last much longer."
42078,""
42078,"Only think of Mrs. Holder's being dead! Poor woman, she has done the"
42078,"only thing in the world she could possibly do to make one cease to abuse"
42078,"her. Now, if you please, Hooper must have it in his power to do more by"
42078,"his uncle. Lucky for the little girl. An Anne Ekins can hardly be so"
42078,"unfit for the care of a child as a Mrs. Holder."
42078,""
42078,"A letter from Wrotham yesterday offering an early visit here, and Mr."
42078,"and Mrs. Moore and one child are to come on Monday for ten days. I hope"
42078,"Charles and Fanny may not fix the same time, but if they come at all in"
42078,"October they must. What is the use of hoping? The two parties of"
42078,"children is the chief evil."
42078,""
42078,"To be sure, here we are; the very thing has happened, or rather"
42078,"worse,--a letter from Charles this very morning, which gives us reason"
42078,"to suppose they may come here to-day. It depends upon the weather, and"
42078,"the weather now is very fine. No difficulties are made, however, and,"
42078,"indeed, there will be no want of room; but I wish there were no Wigrams"
42078,"and Lushingtons in the way to fill up the table and make us such a"
42078,"motley set. I cannot spare Mr. Lushington either, because of his frank,"
42078,"but Mr. Wigram does no good to anybody. I cannot imagine how a man can"
42078,"have the impudence to come into a family party for three days, where he"
42078,"is quite a stranger, unless he knows himself to be agreeable on"
42078,"undoubted authority. He and Edw. B. are going to ride to Eastwell, and"
42078,"as the boys are hunting, and my brother is gone to Canty., Fanny and I"
42078,"have a quiet morning before us."
42078,""
42078,"Edward has driven off poor Mrs. Salkeld. It was thought a good"
42078,"opportunity of doing something towards clearing the house. By her own"
42078,"desire Mrs. Fanny[26] is to be put in the room next the nursery, her baby"
42078,"in a little bed by her; and as Cassy is to have the closet within, and"
42078,"Betsey William's little hole, they will be all very snug together. I"
42078,"shall be most happy to see dear Charles, and he will be as happy as he"
42078,"can with a cross child, or some such care, pressing on him at the time."
42078,"I should be very happy in the idea of seeing little Cassy again, too,"
42078,"did not I fear she would disappoint me by some immediate"
42078,"disagreeableness. . . ."
42078,""
42078,"The comfort of the billiard-table here is very great; it draws all the"
42078,"gentlemen to it whenever they are within, especially after dinner, so"
42078,"that my brother, Fanny, and I have the library to ourselves in"
42078,"delightful quiet. There is no truth in the report of G. Hatton being to"
42078,"marry Miss Wemyss. He desires it may be contradicted."
42078,""
42078,"Have you done anything about our present to Miss Benn? I suppose she"
42078,"must have a bed at my mother's whenever she dines there. How will they"
42078,"manage as to inviting her when you are gone? and if they invite, how"
42078,"will they continue to entertain her?"
42078,""
42078,"Let me know as many of your parting arrangements as you can, as to wine,"
42078,"etc. I wonder whether the ink-bottle has been filled. Does butcher's"
42078,"meat keep up at the same price, and is not bread lower than 2_s._ 6_d._?"
42078,"Mary's blue gown! My mother must be in agonies. I have a great mind to"
42078,"have my blue gown dyed some time or other. I proposed it once to you,"
42078,"and you made some objection, I forget what. It is the fashion of"
42078,"flounces that gives it particular expediency."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. and Miss Wildman have just been here. Miss is very plain. I wish"
42078,"Lady B. may be returned before we leave Gm., that Fanny may spend the"
42078,"time of her father's absence at Goodnestone, which is what she would"
42078,"prefer."
42078,""
42078,"_Friday._--They came last night at about seven. We had given them up,"
42078,"but I still expected them to come. Dessert was nearly over; a better"
42078,"time for arriving than an hour and a half earlier. They were late"
42078,"because they did not set out earlier, and did not allow time enough."
42078,"Charles did not aim at more than reaching Sittingbourne by three, which"
42078,"could not have brought them here by dinner-time. They had a very rough"
42078,"passage; he would not have ventured if he had known how bad it would be."
42078,""
42078,"However, here they are, safe and well, just like their own nice selves,"
42078,"Fanny looking as neat and white this morning as possible, and dear"
42078,"Charles all affectionate, placid, quiet, cheerful good-humor. They are"
42078,"both looking very well, but poor little Cassy is grown extremely thin,"
42078,"and looks poorly. I hope a week's country air and exercise may do her"
42078,"good. I am sorry to say it can be but a week. The baby does not appear"
42078,"so large in proportion as she was, nor quite so pretty, but I have seen"
42078,"very little of her. Cassy was too tired and bewildered just at first to"
42078,"seem to know anybody. We met them in the hall--the women and girl part"
42078,"of us--but before we reached the library she kissed me very"
42078,"affectionately, and has since seemed to recollect me in the same way."
42078,""
42078,"It was quite an evening of confusion, as you may suppose. At first we"
42078,"were all walking about from one part of the house to the other; then"
42078,"came a fresh dinner in the breakfast-room for Charles and his wife,"
42078,"which Fanny and I attended; then we moved into the library, were joined"
42078,"by the dining-room people, were introduced, and so forth; and then we"
42078,"had tea and coffee, which was not over till past ten. Billiards again"
42078,"drew all the odd ones away; and Edward, Charles, the two Fannies, and I"
42078,"sat snugly talking. I shall be glad to have our numbers a little"
42078,"reduced, and by the time you receive this we shall be only a family,"
42078,"though a large family, party. Mr. Lushington goes to-morrow."
42078,""
42078,"Now I must speak of him, and I like him very much. I am sure he is"
42078,"clever, and a man of taste. He got a volume of Milton last night, and"
42078,"spoke of it with warmth. He is quite an M. P., very smiling, with an"
42078,"exceeding good address and readiness of language. I am rather in love"
42078,"with him. I dare say he is ambitious and insincere. He puts me in mind"
42078,"of Mr. Dundas. He has a wide smiling mouth, and very good teeth, and"
42078,"something the same complexion and nose. He is a much shorter man, with"
42078,"Martha's leave. Does Martha never hear from Mrs. Craven? Is Mrs. Craven"
42078,"never at home?"
42078,""
42078,"We breakfasted in the dining-room to-day, and are now all pretty well"
42078,"dispersed and quiet. Charles and George are gone out shooting together,"
42078,"to Winnigates and Seaton Wood. I asked on purpose to tell Henry. Mr."
42078,"Lushington and Edwd. are gone some other way. I wish Charles may kill"
42078,"something; but this high wind is against their sport."
42078,""
42078,"Lady Williams is living at the Rose at Sittingbourne; they called upon"
42078,"her yesterday; she cannot live at Sheerness, and as soon as she gets to"
42078,"Sittingbourne is quite well. In return for all your matches, I announce"
42078,"that her brother William is going to marry a Miss Austen, of a Wiltshire"
42078,"family, who say they are related to us."
42078,""
42078,"I talk to Cassy about Chawton; she remembers much, but does not"
42078,"volunteer on the subject. Poor little love! I wish she were not so very"
42078,"Palmery, but it seems stronger than ever. I never knew a wife's family"
42078,"features have such undue influence."
42078,""
42078,"Papa and mamma have not yet made up their mind as to parting with her or"
42078,"not; the chief, indeed the only, difficulty with mamma is a very"
42078,"reasonable one, the child's being very unwilling to leave them. When it"
42078,"was mentioned to her she did not like the idea of it at all. At the same"
42078,"time she has been suffering so much lately from sea-sickness that her"
42078,"mamma cannot bear to have her much on board this winter. Charles is"
42078,"less inclined to part with her. I do not know how it will end, or what"
42078,"is to determine it. He desires his best love to you, and has not written"
42078,"because he has not been able to decide. They are both very sensible of"
42078,"your kindness on the occasion."
42078,""
42078,"I have made Charles furnish me with something to say about young"
42078,"Kendall. He is going on very well. When he first joined the ""Namur,"" my"
42078,"brother did not find him forward enough to be what they call put in the"
42078,"office, and therefore placed him under the schoolmaster; but he is very"
42078,"much improved, and goes into the office now every afternoon, still"
42078,"attending school in the morning."
42078,""
42078,"This cold weather comes very fortunately for Edward's nerves, with such"
42078,"a house full; it suits him exactly; he is all alive and cheerful. Poor"
42078,"James, on the contrary, must be running his toes into the fire. I find"
42078,"that Mary Jane Fowle was very near returning with her brother and paying"
42078,"them a visit on board. I forget exactly what hindered her; I believe the"
42078,"Cheltenham scheme. I am glad something did. They are to go to Cheltenham"
42078,"on Monday se'nnight. I don't vouch for their going, you know; it only"
42078,"comes from one of the family."
42078,""
42078,"Now I think I have written you a good-sized letter, and may deserve"
42078,"whatever I can get in reply. Infinities of love. I must distinguish"

42078,"that the Adams are gone, and hope Dame Libscombe will be more happy now"

42078,""
42078,"I am sorry you had not any better news to send us of our hare, poor"
42078,"little thing! I thought it would not live long in that _Pondy House_; I"
42078,"don't wonder that Mary Doe is very sorry it is dead, because we promised"

42078,"her for her trouble."
42078,""
42078,"Papa is much obliged to you for ordering the scrubby firs to be cut"

42078,"Fanny quite believed it, for she exclaimed, ""Dear me, what a pity, how"
42078,"could they be so stupid!"" I hope by this time they have put up some"
42078,"hurdles for the sheep, or turned out the cart-horses from the lawn."

42078,"Pray tell grandmamma that we have begun getting seeds for her; I hope we"
42078,"shall be able to get her a nice collection, but I am afraid this wet"
42078,"weather is very much against them. How glad I am to hear she has had"
42078,"such good success with her chickens, but I wish there had been more"
42078,"bantams amongst them. I am very sorry to hear of poor Lizzie's fate."
42078,""
42078,"I must now tell you something about our poor people. I believe you know"
42078,"old Mary Croucher; she gets _maderer_ and _maderer_ every day. Aunt Jane"
42078,"has been to see her, but it was on one of her rational days. Poor Will"
42078,"Amos hopes your skewers are doing well; he has left his house in the"
42078,"poor Row, and lives in a barn at Builting. We asked him why he went"
42078,"away, and he said the fleas were so starved when he came back from"
42078,"Chawton that they all flew upon him and _eenermost_ eat him up."
42078,""
42078,"How unlucky it is that the weather is so wet! Poor Uncle Charles has"

42078,"Cassy's looks are much mended. She agrees pretty well with her cousins,"

42078,""
42078,"We rejoice sincerely in Henry's gaining ground as he does, and hope"
42078,"there will be weather for him to get out every day this week, as the"
42078,"likeliest way of making him equal to what he plans for the next. If he"
42078,"is tolerably well, the going into Oxfordshire will make him better, by"
42078,"making him happier."
42078,""
42078,"Can it be that I have not given you the minutiae of Edward's plans? See,"
42078,"here they are: To go to Wrotham on Saturday the 13th, spend Sunday"
42078,"there, and be in town on Monday to dinner, and if agreeable to Henry,"
42078,"spend one whole day with him, which day is likely to be Tuesday, and so"
42078,"go down to Chawton on Wednesday."
42078,""
42078,"But now I cannot be quite easy without staying a little while with"
42078,"Henry, unless he wishes it otherwise; his illness and the dull time of"
42078,"year together make me feel that it would be horrible of me not to offer"
42078,"to remain with him, and therefore unless you know of any objection, I"
42078,"wish you would tell him with my best love that I shall be most happy to"
42078,"spend ten days or a fortnight in Henrietta St., if he will accept me. I"
42078,"do not offer more than a fortnight, because I shall then have been some"
42078,"time from home; but it will be a great pleasure to be with him, as it"
42078,"always is. I have the less regret and scruple on your account, because I"
42078,"shall see you for a day and a half, and because you will have Edward for"
42078,"at least a week. My scheme is to take Bookham in my way home for a few"
42078,"days, and my hope that Henry will be so good as to send me some part of"
42078,"the way thither. I have a most kind repetition of Mrs. Cooke's two or"
42078,"three dozen invitations, with the offer of meeting me anywhere in one of"
42078,"her airings."
42078,""
42078,"Fanny's cold is much better. By dosing and keeping her room on Sunday,"
42078,"she got rid of the worst of it, but I am rather afraid of what this day"
42078,"may do for her; she is gone to Canty. with Miss Clewes, Liz., and"
42078,"Ma^{rnne}, and it is but roughish weather for any one in a tender state."
42078,"Miss Clewes has been going to Canty. ever since her return, and it is"
42078,"now just accomplishing."
42078,""
42078,"Edward and I had a delightful morning for our drive there, I enjoyed it"
42078,"thoroughly; but the day turned off before we were ready, and we came"
42078,"home in some rain and the apprehension of a great deal. It has not done"
42078,"us any harm, however. He went to inspect the gaol, as a visiting"
42078,"magistrate, and took me with him. I was gratified, and went through all"
42078,"the feelings which people must go through, I think, in visiting such a"
42078,"building. We paid no other visits, only walked about snugly together,"
42078,"and shopped. I bought a concert ticket and a sprig of flowers for my old"
42078,"age."
42078,""
42078,"To vary the subject from gay to grave with inimitable address, I shall"
42078,"now tell you something of the Bath party--and still a Bath party they"
42078,"are, for a fit of the gout came on last week. The accounts of Lady B."
42078,"are as good as can be under such a circumstance; Dr. P. says it appears"
42078,"a good sort of gout, and her spirits are better than usual, but as to"
42078,"her coming away, it is of course all uncertainty. I have very little"
42078,"doubt of Edward's going down to Bath, if they have not left it when he"
42078,"is in Hampshire; if he does, he will go on from Steventon, and then"
42078,"return direct to London, without coming back to Chawton. This detention"
42078,"does not suit his feelings. It may be rather a good thing, however, that"
42078,"Dr. P. should see Lady B. with the gout on her. Harriot was quite"
42078,"wishing for it."
42078,""
42078,"The day seems to improve. I wish my pen would too."
42078,""
42078,"Sweet Mr. Ogle! I dare say he sees all the panoramas for nothing, has"
42078,"free admittance everywhere; he is so delightful! Now, you need not see"
42078,"anybody else."
42078,""
42078,"I am glad to hear of our being likely to have a peep at Charles and"
42078,"Fanny at Christmas, but do not force poor Cass. to stay if she hates it."
42078,"You have done very right as to Mrs. F. A. Your tidings of S. and S. give"
42078,"me pleasure. I have never seen it advertised."
42078,""
42078,"Harriot, in a letter to Fanny to-day, inquires whether they sell cloths"
42078,"for pelisses at Bedford House, and, if they do, will be very much"
42078,"obliged to you to desire them to send her down patterns, with the width"
42078,"and prices; they may go from Charing Cross almost any day in the week,"
42078,"but if it is a ready-money house it will not do, for the _bru_ of _feu_"
42078,"the Archbishop says she cannot pay for it immediately. Fanny and I"
42078,"suspect they do not deal in the article."
42078,""
42078,"The Sherers, I believe, are now really going to go; Joseph has had a bed"
42078,"here the last two nights, and I do not know whether this is not the day"
42078,"of moving. Mrs. Sherer called yesterday to take leave. The weather looks"
42078,"worse again."
42078,""
42078,"We dine at Chilham Castle to-morrow, and I expect to find some"
42078,"amusement, but more from the concert the next day, as I am sure of"
42078,"seeing several that I want to see. We are to meet a party from"
42078,"Goodnestone, Lady B., Miss Hawley, and Lucy Foote, and I am to meet Mrs."
42078,"Harrison, and we are to talk about Ben and Anna. ""My dear Mrs."
42078,"Harrison,"" I shall say, ""I am afraid the young man has some of your"
42078,"family madness; and though there often appears to be something of"
42078,"madness in Anna too, I think she inherits more of it from her mother's"
42078,"family than from ours."" That is what I shall say, and I think she will"
42078,"find it difficult to answer me."
42078,""
42078,"I took up your letter again to refresh me, being somewhat tired, and was"
42078,"struck with the prettiness of the hand: it is really a very pretty hand"
42078,"now and then,--so small and so neat! I wish I could get as much into a"
42078,"sheet of paper.[27] Another time I will take two days to make a letter"
42078,"in: it is fatiguing to write a whole long one at once. I hope to hear"
42078,"from you again on Sunday and again on Friday, the day before we move."
42078,"On Monday, I suppose, you will be going to Streatham, to see quiet Mr."
42078,"Hill and eat very bad baker's bread."
42078,""
42078,"A fall in bread by the by. I hope my mother's bill next week will show"
42078,"it. I have had a very comfortable letter from her, one of her foolscap"
42078,"sheets quite full of little home news. Anna was there the first of the"
42078,"two days. An Anna sent away and an Anna fetched are different things."
42078,"This will be an excellent time for Ben to pay his visit, now that we,"
42078,"the formidables, are absent."
42078,""
42078,"I did not mean to eat, but Mr. Johncock has brought in the tray, so I"
42078,"must. I am all alone. Edward is gone into his woods. At this present"
42078,"time I have five tables, eight-and-twenty chairs, and two fires all to"
42078,"myself."
42078,""
42078,"Miss Clewes is to be invited to go to the concert with us; there will be"
42078,"my brother's place and ticket for her, as he cannot go. He and the other"
42078,"connections of the Cages are to meet at Milgate that very day, to"
42078,"consult about a proposed alteration of the Maidstone road, in which the"
42078,"Cages are very much interested. Sir Brook comes here in the morning, and"
42078,"they are to be joined by Mr. Deedes at Ashford. The loss of the concert"
42078,"will be no great evil to the Squire. We shall be a party of three ladies"
42078,"therefore, and to meet three ladies."
42078,""
42078,"What a convenient carriage Henry's is, to his friends in general! Who"
42078,"has it next? I am glad William's going is voluntary, and on no worse"
42078,"grounds. An inclination for the country is a venial fault. He has more"
42078,"of Cowper than of Johnson in him,--fonder of tame hares and blank verse"
42078,"than of the full tide of human existence at Charing Cross."
42078,""
42078,"Oh! I have more of such sweet flattery from Miss Sharp. She is an"
42078,"excellent kind friend. I am read and admired in Ireland too. There is a"
42078,"Mrs. Fletcher, the wife of a judge, an old lady, and very good and very"
42078,"clever, who is all curiosity to know about me,--what I am like, and so"
42078,"forth. I am not known to her by name, however. This comes through Mrs."
42078,"Carrick, not through Mrs. Gore. You are quite out there."
42078,""
42078,"I do not despair of having my picture in the Exhibition at last,--all"
42078,"white and red, with my head on one side; or perhaps I may marry young"
42078,"Mr. D'Arblay. I suppose in the mean time I shall owe dear Henry a great"
42078,"deal of money for printing, etc."
42078,""
42078,"I hope Mrs. Fletcher will indulge herself with S. and S. If I am to stay"
42078,"in H. S., and if you should be writing home soon, I wish you would be so"
42078,"good as to give a hint of it, for I am not likely to write there again"
42078,"these ten days, having written yesterday."
42078,""
42078,"Fanny has set her heart upon its being a Mr. Brett who is going to marry"
42078,"a Miss Dora Best, of this country. I dare say Henry has no objection."
42078,"Pray, where did the boys sleep?"
42078,""
42078,"The Deedes come here on Monday to stay till Friday, so that we shall end"
42078,"with a flourish the last canto. They bring Isabella and one of the"
42078,"grown-ups, and will come in for a Canty. ball on Thursday. I shall be"
42078,"glad to see them. Mrs. Deedes and I must talk rationally together, I"
42078,"suppose."
42078,""
42078,"Edward does not write to Henry, because of my writing so often. God"
42078,"bless you. I shall be so glad to see you again, and I wish you many"
42078,"happy returns of this day. Poor Lord Howard! How he does cry about it!"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Having half an hour before breakfast (very snug,"
42078,"in my own room, lovely morning, excellent fire--fancy me!) I will give"
42078,"you some account of the last two days. And yet, what is there to be"
42078,"told? I shall get foolishly minute unless I cut the matter short."
42078,""
42078,"We met only the Bretons at Chilham Castle, besides a Mr. and Mrs."
42078,"Osborne and a Miss Lee staying in the house, and were only fourteen"
42078,"altogether. My brother and Fanny thought it the pleasantest party they"
42078,"had ever known there, and I was very well entertained by bits and"
42078,"scraps. I had long wanted to see Dr. Breton, and his wife amuses me very"
42078,"much with her affected refinement and elegance. Miss Lee I found very"
42078,"conversable; she admires Crabbe as she ought. She is at an age of"
42078,"reason, ten years older than myself at least. She was at the famous ball"
42078,"at Chilham Castle, so of course you remember her."
42078,""
42078,"By the by, as I must leave off being young, I find many _douceurs_ in"
42078,"being a sort of _chaperon_, for I am put on the sofa near the fire, and"
42078,"can drink as much wine as I like. We had music in the evening: Fanny and"
42078,"Miss Wildman played, and Mr. James Wildman sat close by and listened, or"
42078,"pretended to listen."
42078,""
42078,"Yesterday was a day of dissipation all through: first came Sir Brook to"
42078,"dissipate us before breakfast; then there was a call from Mr. Sherer,"
42078,"then a regular morning visit from Lady Honeywood in her way home from"
42078,"Eastwell; then Sir Brook and Edward set off; then we dined (five in"
42078,"number) at half-past four; then we had coffee; and at six Miss Clewes,"
42078,"Fanny, and I drove away. We had a beautiful night for our frisks. We"
42078,"were earlier than we need have been, but after a time Lady B. and her"
42078,"two companions appeared,--we had kept places for them; and there we sat,"
42078,"all six in a row, under a side wall, I between Lucy Foote and Miss"
42078,"Clewes."
42078,""
42078,"Lady B. was much what I expected; I could not determine whether she was"
42078,"rather handsome or very plain. I liked her for being in a hurry to have"
42078,"the concert over and get away, and for getting away at last with a great"
42078,"deal of decision and promptness, not waiting to compliment and dawdle"
42078,"and fuss about seeing dear Fanny, who was half the evening in another"
42078,"part of the room with her friends the Plumptres. I am growing too"
42078,"minute, so I will go to breakfast."
42078,""
42078,"When the concert was over, Mrs. Harrison and I found each other out, and"
42078,"had a very comfortable little complimentary friendly chat. She is a"
42078,"sweet woman,--still quite a sweet woman in herself, and so like her"
42078,"sister! I could almost have thought I was speaking to Mrs. Lefroy. She"
42078,"introduced me to her daughter, whom I think pretty, but most dutifully"
42078,"inferior to _la Mere Beaute_. The Faggs and the Hammonds were"
42078,"there,--Wm. Hammond the only young man of renown. Miss looked very"
42078,"handsome, but I prefer her little smiling flirting sister Julia."
42078,""
42078,"I was just introduced at last to Mary Plumptre, but I should hardly know"
42078,"her again. She was delighted with me, however, good enthusiastic soul!"
42078,"And Lady B. found me handsomer than she expected, so you see I am not so"
42078,"very bad as you might think for."
42078,""
42078,"It was twelve before we reached home. We were all dog-tired, but pretty"
42078,"well to-day: Miss Clewes says she has not caught cold, and Fanny's does"
42078,"not seem worse. I was so tired that I began to wonder how I should get"
42078,"through the ball next Thursday; but there will be so much more variety"
42078,"then in walking about, and probably so much less heat, that perhaps I"
42078,"may not feel it more. My china crape is still kept for the ball. Enough"
42078,"of the concert."
42078,""
42078,"I had a letter from Mary yesterday. They travelled down to Cheltenham"
42078,"last Monday very safely, and are certainly to be there a month. Bath is"
42078,"still Bath. The H. Bridges must quit them early next week, and Louisa"
42078,"seems not quite to despair of their all moving together, but to those"
42078,"who see at a distance there appears no chance of it. Dr. Parry does not"
42078,"want to keep Lady B. at Bath when she can once move. That is lucky. You"
42078,"will see poor Mr. Evelyn's death."
42078,""
42078,"Since I wrote last, my 2nd edit. has stared me in the face. Mary tells"
42078,"me that Eliza means to buy it. I wish she may. It can hardly depend upon"
42078,"any more Fyfield Estates. I cannot help hoping that many will feel"
42078,"themselves obliged to buy it. I shall not mind imagining it a"
42078,"disagreeable duty to them, so as they do it. Mary heard before she left"
42078,"home that it was very much admired at Cheltenham, and that it was given"
42078,"to Miss Hamilton. It is pleasant to have such a respectable writer"
42078,"named. I cannot tire you, I am sure, on this subject, or I would"
42078,"apologize."
42078,""
42078,"What weather, and what news! We have enough to do to admire them both. I"
42078,"hope you derive your full share of enjoyment from each."
42078,""
42078,"I have extended my lights and increased my acquaintance a good deal"
42078,"within these two days. Lady Honeywood you know; I did not sit near"
42078,"enough to be a perfect judge, but I thought her extremely pretty, and"
42078,"her manners have all the recommendations of ease and good-humor and"
42078,"unaffectedness; and going about with four horses and nicely dressed"
42078,"herself, she is altogether a perfect sort of woman."
42078,""
42078,"Oh, and I saw Mr. Gipps last night,--the useful Mr. Gipps, whose"
42078,"attentions came in as acceptably to us in handing us to the carriage,"
42078,"for want of a better man, as they did to Emma Plumptre. I thought him"
42078,"rather a good-looking little man."
42078,""
42078,"I long for your letter to-morrow, particularly that I may know my fate"
42078,"as to London. My first wish is that Henry should really choose what he"
42078,"likes best; I shall certainly not be sorry if he does not want me."
42078,"Morning church to-morrow; I shall come back with impatient feelings."
42078,""
42078,"The Sherers are gone, but the Pagets are not come: we shall therefore"
42078,"have Mr. S. again. Mr. Paget acts like an unsteady man. Dr. Hant,"
42078,"however, gives him a very good character; what is wrong is to be imputed"
42078,"to the lady. I dare say the house likes female government."
42078,""
42078,"I have a nice long black and red letter from Charles, but not"
42078,"communicating much that I did not know."
42078,""
42078,"There is some chance of a good ball next week, as far as females go."
42078,"Lady Bridges may perhaps be there with some Knatchbulls. Mrs. Harrison"
42078,"perhaps, with Miss Oxenden and the Miss Papillons; and if Mrs. Harrison,"
42078,"then Lady Fagg will come."
42078,""
42078,"The shades of evening are descending, and I resume my interesting"
42078,"narrative. Sir Brook and my brother came back about four, and Sir Brook"
42078,"almost immediately set forward again to Goodnestone. We are to have"
42078,"Edwd. B. to-morrow, to pay us another Sunday's visit,--the last, for"
42078,"more reasons than one; they all come home on the same day that we go."
42078,"The Deedes do not come till Tuesday; Sophia is to be the comer. She is a"
42078,"disputable beauty that I want much to see. Lady Eliz. Hatton and"
42078,"Annamaria called here this morning. Yes, they called; but I do not think"
42078,"I can say anything more about them. They came, and they sat, and they"
42078,"went."
42078,""
42078,"_Sunday._--Dearest Henry! What a turn he has for being ill, and what a"
42078,"thing bile is! This attack has probably been brought on in part by his"
42078,"previous confinement and anxiety; but, however it came, I hope it is"
42078,"going fast, and that you will be able to send a very good account of him"
42078,"on Tuesday. As I hear on Wednesday, of course I shall not expect to hear"
42078,"again on Friday. Perhaps a letter to Wrotham would not have an ill"
42078,"effect."
42078,""
42078,"We are to be off on Saturday before the post comes in, as Edward takes"
42078,"his own horses all the way. He talks of nine o'clock. We shall bait at"
42078,"Lenham."
42078,""
42078,"Excellent sweetness of you to send me such a nice long letter; it made"
42078,"its appearance, with one from my mother, soon after I and my impatient"
42078,"feelings walked in. How glad I am that I did what I did! I was only"
42078,"afraid that you might think the offer superfluous, but you have set my"
42078,"heart at ease. Tell Henry that I will stay with him, let it be ever so"
42078,"disagreeable to him."
42078,""
42078,"Oh, dear me! I have not time on paper for half that I want to say. There"
42078,"have been two letters from Oxford,--one from George yesterday. They got"
42078,"there very safely,--Edwd. two hours behind the coach, having lost his"
42078,"way in leaving London. George writes cheerfully and quietly; hopes to"
42078,"have Utterson's rooms soon; went to lecture on Wednesday, states some of"
42078,"his expenses, and concludes with saying, ""I am afraid I shall be poor."""
42078,"I am glad he thinks about it so soon. I believe there is no private"
42078,"tutor yet chosen, but my brother is to hear from Edwd. on the subject"
42078,"shortly."
42078,""
42078,"You, and Mrs. H., and Catherine, and Alethea going about together in"
42078,"Henry's carriage seeing sights--I am not used to the idea of it yet. All"
42078,"that you are to see of Streatham, seen already! Your Streatham and my"
42078,"Bookham may go hang. The prospect of being taken down to Chawton by"
42078,"Henry perfects the plan to me. I was in hopes of your seeing some"
42078,"illuminations, and you have seen them. ""I thought you would come, and"
42078,"you did come."" I am sorry he is not to come from the Baltic sooner. Poor"
42078,"Mary!"
42078,""
42078,"My brother has a letter from Louisa to-day of an unwelcome nature; they"
42078,"are to spend the winter at Bath. It was just decided on. Dr. Parry"
42078,"wished it, not from thinking the water necessary to Lady B., but that he"
42078,"might be better able to judge how far his treatment of her, which is"
42078,"totally different from anything she had been used to, is right; and I"
42078,"suppose he will not mind having a few more of her Ladyship's guineas."
42078,"His system is a lowering one. He took twelve ounces of blood from her"
42078,"when the gout appeared, and forbids wine, etc. Hitherto the plan agrees"
42078,"with her. She is very well satisfied to stay, but it is a sore"
42078,"disappointment to Louisa and Fanny."
42078,""
42078,"The H. Bridges leave them on Tuesday, and they mean to move into a"
42078,"smaller house; you may guess how Edward feels. There can be no doubt of"
42078,"his going to Bath now; I should not wonder if he brought Fanny Cage back"

42078,""
42078,"We had altogether a very good journey, and everything at Cobham was"
42078,"comfortable. I could not pay Mr. Harrington! That was the only alas! of"
42078,"the business. I shall therefore return his bill, and my mother's 2_l._,"
42078,"that you may try your luck. We did not begin reading till Bentley Green."
42078,"Henry's approbation is hitherto even equal to my wishes. He says it is"
42078,"different from the other two, but does not appear to think it at all"
42078,"inferior. He has only married Mrs. R.[28] I am afraid he has gone through"
42078,"the most entertaining part. He took to Lady B. and Mrs. N.[29] most"
42078,"kindly, and gives great praise to the drawing of the characters. He"
42078,"understands them all, likes Fanny, and, I think, foresees how it will"
42078,"all be. I finished the ""Heroine"" last night, and was very much amused by"
42078,"it. I wonder James did not like it better. It diverted me exceedingly."
42078,"We went to bed at ten. I was very tired, but slept to a miracle, and am"
42078,"lovely to-day, and at present Henry seems to have no complaint. We left"
42078,"Cobham at half-past eight, stopped to bait and breakfast at Kingston,"
42078,"and were in this house considerably before two. Nice smiling Mr. Barlowe"
42078,"met us at the door, and, in reply to inquiries after news, said that"
42078,"peace was generally expected. I have taken possession of my bedroom,"
42078,"unpacked my bandbox, sent Miss P.'s two letters to the twopenny post,"
42078,"been visited by M^{d.} B., and am now writing by myself at the new table"
42078,"in the front room. It is snowing. We had some snowstorms yesterday, and"
42078,"a smart frost at night, which gave us a hard road from Cobham to"
42078,"Kingston; but as it was then getting dirty and heavy, Henry had a pair"
42078,"of leaders put on to the bottom of Sloane St. His own horses, therefore,"
42078,"cannot have had hard work. I watched for veils as we drove through the"
42078,"streets, and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads. And"
42078,"now, how do you all do?--you in particular, after the worry of yesterday"
42078,"and the day before. I hope Martha had a pleasant visit again, and that"
42078,"you and my mother could eat your beef-pudding. Depend upon my thinking"
42078,"of the chimney-sweeper as soon as I wake to-morrow. Places are secured"
42078,"at Drury Lane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean"
42078,"that only a third and fourth row could be got; as it is in a front box,"
42078,"however, I hope we shall do pretty well--Shylock, a good play for"
42078,"Fanny--she cannot be much affected, I think. Mrs. Perigord has just been"
42078,"here. She tells me that we owe her master for the silk-dyeing. My poor"
42078,"old muslin has never been dyed yet. It has been promised to be done"
42078,"several times. What wicked people dyers are! They begin with dipping"
42078,"their own souls in scarlet sin. It is evening. We have drank tea, and I"
42078,"have torn through the third vol. of the ""Heroine."" I do not think it"
42078,"falls off. It is a delightful burlesque, particularly on the Radcliffe"
42078,"style. Henry is going on with ""Mansfield Park."" He admires H. Crawford:"
42078,"I mean properly, as a clever, pleasant man. I tell you all the good I"
42078,"can, as I know how much you will enjoy it. We hear that Mr. Kean is more"
42078,"admired than ever. There are no good places to be got in Drury Lane for"
42078,"the next fortnight, but Henry means to secure some for Saturday"
42078,"fortnight, when you are reckoned upon. Give my love to little Cass. I"
42078,"hope she found my bed comfortable last night. I have seen nobody in"
42078,"London yet with such a long chin as Dr. Syntax, nor anybody quite so"
42078,"large as Gogmagolicus."

42078,"MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I had a very good journey, not crowded, two of the"

42078,"size; and they were all very quiet and civil. We were late in London,"
42078,"from being a great load, and from changing coaches at Farnham; it was"
42078,"nearly four, I believe, when we reached Sloane Street. Henry himself met"
42078,"me, and as soon as my trunk and basket could be routed out from all the"
42078,"other trunks and baskets in the world, we were on our way to Hans Place"
42078,"in the luxury of a nice, large, cool, dirty hackney coach."
42078,""
42078,"There were four in the kitchen part of Yalden, and I was told fifteen at"
42078,"top, among them Percy Benn. We met in the same room at Egham, but poor"
42078,"Percy was not in his usual spirits. He would be more chatty, I dare say,"
42078,"in his way from Woolwich. We took up a young Gibson at Holybourn, and,"
42078,"in short, everybody either did come up by Yalden yesterday, or wanted to"
42078,"come up. It put me in mind of my own coach between Edinburgh and"
42078,"Stirling."
42078,""
42078,"Henry is very well, and has given me an account of the Canterbury races,"
42078,"which seem to have been as pleasant as one could wish. Everything went"
42078,"well. Fanny had good partners, Mr. ---- was her second on Thursday, but"
42078,"he did not dance with her any more."
42078,""
42078,"This will content you for the present. I must just add, however, that"

42078,""
42078,"No James and Edward yet. Our evening yesterday was perfectly quiet; we"
42078,"only talked a little to Mr. Tilson across the intermediate gardens; she"
42078,"was gone out airing with Miss Burdett. It is a delightful place,--more"
42078,"than answers my expectation. Having got rid of my unreasonable ideas, I"
42078,"find more space and comfort in the rooms than I had supposed, and the"
42078,"garden is quite a love. I am in the front attic, which is the bedchamber"

42078,"is to drive me there by and by, and we shall take an airing together;"
42078,"and I do not mean to take any other exercise, for I feel a little tired"

42078,"soon, and like the idea of her better than of anybody else at hand."

42078,"to be a fine day. How do you all do?"

42078,"Henry talks of being at Chawton about the 1st of Sept. He has once"
42078,"mentioned a scheme which I should rather like,--calling on the Birches"
42078,"and the Crutchleys in our way. It may never come to anything, but I must"
42078,"provide for the possibility by troubling you to send up my silk pelisse"
42078,"by Collier on Saturday. I feel it would be necessary on such an"
42078,"occasion; and be so good as to put up a clean dressing-gown which will"
42078,"come from the wash on Friday. You need not direct it to be left"
42078,"anywhere. It may take its chance."
42078,""
42078,"We are to call for Henry between three and four, and I must finish this"
42078,"and carry it with me, as he is not always there in the morning before"
42078,"the parcel is made up. And before I set off, I must return Mrs. Tilson's"
42078,"visit. I hear nothing of the Hoblyns, and abstain from all inquiry."

42078,"well done, and Cecilia continues to be interesting in spite of her being"

42078,"felt tempted to make; the principal of them is a speech of St. Julian to"
42078,"Lady Helen, which you see I have presumed to alter. As Lady H. is"
42078,"Cecilia's superior, it would not be correct to talk of her being"
42078,"introduced. It is Cecilia who must be introduced. And I do not like a"

42078,"in time; but ""Enthusiasm"" was something so very superior that my common"
42078,"title must appear to disadvantage. I am not sensible of any blunders"
42078,"about Dawlish; the library was pitiful and wretched twelve years ago,"
42078,"and not likely to have anybody's publications. There is no such title as"
42078,"Desborough, either among dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, or barons."

42078,"_Wednesday_, 17.--We have now just finished the first of the three books"
42078,"I had the pleasure of receiving yesterday. I read it aloud, and we are"
42078,"all very much amused, and like the work quite as well as ever. I depend"
42078,"on getting through another book before dinner, but there is really a"
42078,"good deal of respectable reading in your forty-eight pages. I have no"
42078,"doubt six would make a very good-sized volume. You must have been quite"
42078,"pleased to have accomplished so much. I like Lord Portman and his"
42078,"brother very much. I am only afraid that Lord P.'s good nature will make"
42078,"most people like him better than he deserves. The whole family are very"
42078,"good; and Lady Anne, who was your great dread, you have succeeded"
42078,"particularly well with. Bell Griffin is just what she should be. My"
42078,"corrections have not been more important than before; here and there we"
42078,"have thought the sense could be expressed in fewer words, and I have"
42078,"scratched out Sir Thos. from walking with the others to the stables,"
42078,"etc. the very day after breaking his arm; for though I find your papa"
42078,"did walk out immediately after his arm was set, I think it can be so"
42078,"little usual as to appear unnatural in a book. Lynn will not do. Lynn is"
42078,"towards forty miles from Dawlish and would not be talked of there. I"
42078,"have put Starcross instead. If you prefer Easton, that must be always"
42078,"safe."
42078,""
42078,"I have also scratched out the introduction between Lord Portman and his"
42078,"brother and Mr. Griffin. A country surgeon (don't tell Mr. C. Lyford)"
42078,"would not be introduced to men of their rank; and when Mr. P. is first"
42078,"brought in, he would not be introduced as the Honorable. That"
42078,"distinction is never mentioned at such times; at least, I believe not."
42078,"Now we have finished the second book, or rather the fifth. I do think"
42078,"you had better omit Lady Helena's postscript. To those that are"
42078,"acquainted with ""Pride and Prejudice"" it will seem an imitation. And"
42078,"your Aunt C. and I both recommend your making a little alteration in the"
42078,"last scene between Devereux F. and Lady Clanmurray and her daughter. We"
42078,"think they press him too much, more than sensible or well-bred women"
42078,"would do; Lady C., at least, should have discretion enough to be sooner"
42078,"satisfied with his determination of not going with them. I am very much"
42078,"pleased with Egerton as yet. I did not expect to like him, but I do, and"
42078,"Susan is a very nice little animated creature; but St. Julian is the"
42078,"delight of our lives. He is quite interesting. The whole of his"
42078,"break-off with Lady Helena is very well done. Yes; Russell Square is a"
42078,"very proper distance from Berkeley Square. We are reading the last book."
42078,"They must be two days going from Dawlish to Bath. They are nearly one"
42078,"hundred miles apart."
42078,""
42078,"_Thursday._--We finished it last night after our return from drinking"
42078,"tea at the Great House. The last chapter does not please us quite so"
42078,"well; we do not thoroughly like the play, perhaps from having had too"
42078,"much of plays in that way lately (_vide_ ""Mansfield Park""), and we think"
42078,"you had better not leave England. Let the Portmans go to Ireland; but as"
42078,"you know nothing of the manners there, you had better not go with them."
42078,"You will be in danger of giving false representations. Stick to Bath and"
42078,"the Foresters. There you will be quite at home."
42078,""
42078,"Your Aunt C. does not like desultory novels, and is rather afraid yours"
42078,"will be too much so, that there will be too frequently a change from one"
42078,"set of people to another, and that circumstances will be introduced of"
42078,"apparent consequence which will lead to nothing. It will not be so great"
42078,"an objection to me if it does. I allow much more latitude than she does,"
42078,"and think Nature and spirit cover many sins of a wandering story, and"
42078,"people in general do not care so much about it for your comfort."
42078,""
42078,"I should like to have had more of Devereux. I do not feel enough"
42078,"acquainted with him. You were afraid of meddling with him, I dare say. I"
42078,"like your sketch of Lord Clanmurray, and your picture of the two young"
42078,"girls' enjoyment is very good. I have not noticed St. Julian's serious"
42078,"conversation with Cecilia, but I like it exceedingly. What he says about"
42078,"the madness of otherwise sensible women on the subject of their"
42078,"daughters coming out is worth its weight in gold."

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR ANNA,--We have been very much amused by your three books, but I"
42078,"have a good many criticisms to make, more than you will like. We are not"
42078,"satisfied with Mrs. Forester settling herself as tenant and near"
42078,"neighbor to such a man as Sir Thomas, without having some other"
42078,"inducement to go there. She ought to have some friend living thereabouts"
42078,"to tempt her. A woman going with two girls just growing up into a"
42078,"neighborhood where she knows nobody but one man of not very good"
42078,"character, is an awkwardness which so prudent a woman as Mrs. F. would"
42078,"not be likely to fall into. Remember she is very prudent. You must not"
42078,"let her act inconsistently. Give her a friend, and let that friend be"
42078,"invited by Sir Thomas H. to meet her, and we shall have no objection to"
42078,"her dining at the Priory as she does; but otherwise a woman in her"
42078,"situation would hardly go there before she had been visited by other"
42078,"families. I like the scene itself, the Miss Leslie, Lady Anne, and the"
42078,"music very much. Leslie is a noble name. Sir Thomas H. you always do"
42078,"very well. I have only taken the liberty of expunging one phrase of his"
42078,"which would not be allowable,--""Bless my heart!"" It is too familiar and"
42078,"inelegant. Your grandmother is more disturbed at Mrs. Forester's not"
42078,"returning the Egertons' visit sooner than by anything else. They ought"
42078,"to have called at the Parsonage before Sunday. You describe a sweet"
42078,"place, but your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked."
42078,"You give too many particulars of right hand and left. Mrs. Forester is"
42078,"not careful enough of Susan's health. Susan ought not to be walking out"
42078,"so soon after heavy rains, taking long walks in the dirt. An anxious"
42078,"mother would not suffer it. I like your Susan very much; she is a sweet"
42078,"creature, her playfulness of fancy is very delightful. I like her as she"
42078,"is now exceedingly, but I am not quite so well satisfied with her"
42078,"behavior to George R. At first she seems all over attachment and"
42078,"feeling, and afterwards to have none at all; she is so extremely"
42078,"confused at the ball, and so well satisfied apparently with Mr. Morgan."
42078,"She seems to have changed her character."
42078,""
42078,"You are now collecting your people delightfully, getting them exactly"
42078,"into such a spot as is the delight of my life. Three or four families in"
42078,"a country village is the very thing to work on, and I hope you will do a"
42078,"great deal more, and make full use of them while they are so very"
42078,"favorably arranged."
42078,""
42078,"You are but now coming to the heart and beauty of your story. Until the"
42078,"heroine grows up the fun must be imperfect, but I expect a great deal of"
42078,"entertainment from the next three or four books, and I hope you will not"
42078,"resent these remarks by sending me no more. We like the Egertons very"
42078,"well. We see no blue pantaloons or cocks or hens. There is nothing to"
42078,"enchant one certainly in Mr. L. L., but we make no objection to him, and"
42078,"his inclination to like Susan is pleasing. The sister is a good"
42078,"contrast, but the name of Rachel is as much as I can bear. They are not"
42078,"so much like the Papillons as I expected. Your last chapter is very"
42078,"entertaining, the conversation on genius, etc.; Mr. St. Julian and Susan"
42078,"both talk in character, and very well. In some former parts Cecilia is"
42078,"perhaps a little too solemn and good, but upon the whole her disposition"
42078,"is very well opposed to Susan's, her want of imagination is very"
42078,"natural. I wish you could make Mrs. Forester talk more; but she must be"
42078,"difficult to manage and make entertaining, because there is so much good"
42078,"sense and propriety about her that nothing can be made very broad. Her"
42078,"economy and her ambition must not be staring. The papers left by Mrs."
42078,"Fisher are very good. Of course one guesses something. I hope when you"
42078,"have written a great deal more, you will be equal to scratching out some"
42078,"of the past. The scene with Mrs. Mellish I should condemn; it is prosy"
42078,"and nothing to the purpose, and indeed the more you can find in your"
42078,"heart to curtail between Dawlish and Newton Priors, the better I think"
42078,"it will be,--one does not care for girls until they are grown up. Your"
42078,"Aunt C. quite understands the exquisiteness of that name,--Newton Priors"
42078,"is really a nonpareil. Milton would have given his eyes to have thought"
42078,"of it. Is not the cottage taken from Tollard Royal?"
42078,""
42078,"[Thus far the letter was written on the 9th, but before it was finished"

42078,""
42078,"MY DEAR ANNA,--I hope you do not depend on having your book again"
42078,"immediately. I kept it that your grandmamma may hear it, for it has not"
42078,"been possible yet to have any public reading. I have read it to your"
42078,"Aunt Cassandra, however, in our own room at night, while we undressed,"
42078,"and with a great deal of pleasure. We like the first chapter extremely,"
42078,"with only a little doubt whether Lady Helena is not almost too foolish."
42078,"The matrimonial dialogue is very good certainly. I like Susan as well as"
42078,"ever, and begin now not to care at all about Cecilia; she may stay at"
42078,"Easton Court as long as she likes. Henry Mellish will be, I am afraid,"
42078,"too much in the common novel style,--a handsome, amiable,"
42078,"unexceptionable young man (such as do not much abound in real life),"
42078,"desperately in love and all in vain. But I have no business to judge him"
42078,"so early Jane Egerton is a very natural, comprehensible girl, and the"
42078,"whole of her acquaintance with Susan and Susan's letter to Cecilia are"
42078,"very pleasing and quite in character. But Miss Egerton does not entirely"
42078,"satisfy us. She is too formal and solemn, we think, in her advice to her"
42078,"brother not to fall in love; and it is hardly like a sensible woman,--it"
42078,"is putting it into his head. We should like a few hints from her better."
42078,"We feel really obliged to you for introducing a Lady Kenrick; it will"
42078,"remove the greatest fault in the work, and I give you credit for"
42078,"considerable forbearance as an author in adopting so much of our"
42078,"opinion. I expect high fun about Mrs. Fisher and Sir Thomas. You have"
42078,"been perfectly right in telling Ben. Lefroy of your work, and I am very"
42078,"glad to hear how much he likes it. His encouragement and approbation"
42078,"must be ""quite beyond everything.""[33] I do not at all wonder at his not"
42078,"expecting to like anybody so well as Cecilia at first, but I shall be"
42078,"surprised if he does not become a Susanite in time. Devereux Forester's"
42078,"being ruined by his vanity is extremely good, but I wish you would not"
42078,"let him plunge into a ""vortex of dissipation."" I do not object to the"
42078,"thing, but I cannot bear the expression; it is such thorough novel"
42078,"slang, and so old that I dare say Adam met with it in the first novel"
42078,"he opened. Indeed, I did very much like to know Ben's opinion. I hope he"
42078,"will continue to be pleased with it, and I think he must, but I cannot"
42078,"flatter him with there being much incident. We have no great right to"
42078,"wonder at his not valuing the name of Progillian. That is a source of"
42078,"delight which even he can hardly be quite competent to."
42078,""
42078,"Walter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. It"
42078,"is not fair. He has fame and profit enough as a poet, and should not be"

42078,""
42078,"I do not like him, and do not mean to like ""Waverley"" if I can help it,"

42078,"I am quite determined, however, not to be pleased with Mrs. West's"

42078,"What can you do with Egerton to increase the interest for him? I wish"

42078,"good qualities more. Some distress among brothers and sisters to relieve"
42078,"by the sale of his curacy! Something to carry him mysteriously away, and"
42078,"then be heard of at York or Edinburgh in an old greatcoat. I would not"
42078,"seriously recommend anything improbable, but if you could invent"
42078,"something spirited for him, it would have a good effect. He might lend"
42078,"all his money to Captain Morris, but then he would be a great fool if he"

42078,"because she cannot agree with the other servants. She is in love with"
42078,"the man, and her head seems rather turned. He returns her affection, but"
42078,"she fancies every one else is wanting him and envying her. Her previous"
42078,"service must have fitted her for such a place as yours, and she is very"
42078,"active and cleanly. The Webbs are really gone! When I saw the wagons at"
42078,"the door, and thought of all the trouble they must have in moving, I"

42078,""
42078,"I FEEL quite as doubtful as you could be, my dearest Fanny, as to when"
42078,"my letter may be finished, for I can command very little quiet time at"
42078,"present; but yet I must begin, for I know you will be glad to hear as"
42078,"soon as possible, and I really am impatient myself to be writing"
42078,"something on so very interesting a subject, though I have no hope of"
42078,"writing anything to the purpose. I shall do very little more, I dare"
42078,"say, than say over again what you have said before."
42078,""
42078,"I was certainly a good deal surprised at first, as I had no suspicion of"
42078,"any change in your feelings, and I have no scruple in saying that you"
42078,"cannot be in love. My dear Fanny, I am ready to laugh at the idea, and"
42078,"yet it is no laughing matter to have had you so mistaken as to your own"
42078,"feelings. And with all my heart I wish I had cautioned you on that point"
42078,"when first you spoke to me; but though I did not think you then much in"
42078,"love, I did consider you as being attached in a degree quite"
42078,"sufficiently for happiness, as I had no doubt it would increase with"
42078,"opportunity, and from the time of our being in London together I thought"
42078,"you really very much in love. But you certainly are not at all--there is"
42078,"no concealing it."
42078,""
42078,"What strange creatures we are! It seems as if your being secure of him"
42078,"had made you indifferent. There was a little disgust, I suspect, at the"
42078,"races, and I do not wonder at it. His expressions then would not do for"
42078,"one who had rather more acuteness, penetration, and taste, than love,"
42078,"which was your case. And yet, after all, I am surprised that the change"
42078,"in your feelings should be so great. He is just what he ever was, only"
42078,"more evidently and uniformly devoted to you. This is all the difference."
42078,"How shall we account for it?"
42078,""
42078,"My dearest Fanny, I am writing what will not be of the smallest use to"
42078,"you. I am feeling differently every moment, and shall not be able to"
42078,"suggest a single thing that can assist your mind. I could lament in one"
42078,"sentence and laugh in the next, but as to opinion or counsel I am sure"
42078,"that none will be extracted worth having from this letter."
42078,""
42078,"I read yours through the very evening I received it, getting away by"
42078,"myself. I could not bear to leave off when I had once begun. I was full"
42078,"of curiosity and concern. Luckily your At. C. dined at the other house;"
42078,"therefore I had not to manoeuvre away from her, and as to anybody else,"
42078,"I do not care."
42078,""
42078,"Poor dear Mr. A.! Oh, dear Fanny! your mistake has been one that"
42078,"thousands of women fall into. He was the first young man who attached"
42078,"himself to you. That was the charm, and most powerful it is. Among the"
42078,"multitudes, however, that make the same mistake with yourself, there can"
42078,"be few indeed who have so little reason to regret it; his character and"
42078,"his attachment leave you nothing to be ashamed of."
42078,""
42078,"Upon the whole, what is to be done? You have no inclination for any"
42078,"other person. His situation in life, family, friends, and, above all,"
42078,"his character, his uncommonly amiable mind, strict principles, just"
42078,"notions, good habits, all that you know so well how to value, all that"
42078,"is really of the first importance,--everything of this nature pleads his"
42078,"cause most strongly. You have no doubt of his having superior abilities,"
42078,"he has proved it at the University; he is, I dare say, such a scholar as"
42078,"your agreeable, idle brothers would ill bear a comparison with."
42078,""
42078,"Oh, my dear Fanny! the more I write about him the warmer my feelings"
42078,"become,--the more strongly I feel the sterling worth of such a young"
42078,"man, and the desirableness of your growing in love with him again. I"
42078,"recommend this most thoroughly. There are such beings in the world,"
42078,"perhaps one in a thousand, as the creature you and I should think"
42078,"perfection, where grace and spirit are united to worth, where the"
42078,"manners are equal to the heart and understanding; but such a person may"
42078,"not come in your way, or, if he does, he may not be the eldest son of a"
42078,"man of fortune, the near relation of your particular friend, and"
42078,"belonging to your own county."
42078,""
42078,"Think of all this, Fanny. Mr. A. has advantages which we do not often"
42078,"meet in one person. His only fault, indeed, seems modesty. If he were"
42078,"less modest, he would be more agreeable, speak louder, and look"
42078,"impudenter; and is not it a fine character of which modesty is the only"
42078,"defect? I have no doubt he will get more lively and more like yourselves"
42078,"as he is more with you; he will catch your ways if he belongs to you."
42078,"And as to there being any objection from his goodness, from the danger"
42078,"of his becoming even evangelical, I cannot admit that. I am by no means"
42078,"convinced that we ought not all to be evangelicals, and am at least"
42078,"persuaded that they who are so from reason and feeling must be happiest"
42078,"and safest. Do not be frightened from the connection by your brothers"
42078,"having most wit,--wisdom is better than wit, and in the long run will"
42078,"certainly have the laugh on her side; and don't be frightened by the"
42078,"idea of his acting more strictly up to the precepts of the New Testament"
42078,"than others."
42078,""
42078,"And now, my dear Fanny, having written so much on one side of the"
42078,"question, I shall turn round and entreat you not to commit yourself"
42078,"farther, and not to think of accepting him unless you really do like"
42078,"him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying"
42078,"without affection; and if his deficiencies of manner, etc., etc.,"
42078,"strike you more than all his good qualities, if you continue to think"
42078,"strongly of them, give him up at once. Things are now in such a state"
42078,"that you must resolve upon one or the other,--either to allow him to go"
42078,"on as he has done, or whenever you are together behave with a coldness"
42078,"which may convince him that he has been deceiving himself. I have no"
42078,"doubt of his suffering a good deal for a time,--a great deal when he"
42078,"feels that he must give you up; but it is no creed of mine, as you must"
42078,"be well aware, that such sort of disappointments kill anybody."
42078,""
42078,"Your sending the music was an admirable device, it made everything easy,"
42078,"and I do not know how I could have accounted for the parcel otherwise;"
42078,"for though your dear papa most conscientiously hunted about till he"
42078,"found me alone in the dining-parlor, your Aunt C. had seen that he had a"
42078,"parcel to deliver. As it was, however, I do not think anything was"
42078,"suspected."
42078,""
42078,"We have heard nothing fresh from Anna. I trust she is very comfortable"
42078,"in her new home. Her letters have been very sensible and satisfactory,"
42078,"with no parade of happiness, which I liked them the better for. I have"
42078,"often known young married women write in a way I did not like in that"
42078,"respect."
42078,""
42078,"You will be glad to hear that the first edition of M. P.[34] is all"
42078,"sold. Your Uncle Henry is rather wanting me to come to town to settle"
42078,"about a second edition; but as I could not very conveniently leave home"
42078,"now, I have written him my will and pleasure and unless he still urges"
42078,"it, shall not go. I am very greedy and want to make the most of it; but"
42078,"as you are much above caring about money, I shall not plague you with"
42078,"any particulars. The pleasures of vanity are more within your"
42078,"comprehension, and you will enter into mine at receiving the praise"
42078,"which every now and then comes to me through some channel or other."

42078,"We shall be a snug half-dozen. Miss Lloyd came, as we expected,"

42078,"MY DEAR ANNA,--I have been very far from finding your book an evil, I"

42078,"are going on very well. The description of Dr. Griffin and Lady Helena's"
42078,"unhappiness is very good, and just what was likely to be. I am curious"
42078,"to know what the end of them will be. The name of Newton Priors is"
42078,"really invaluable; I never met with anything superior to it. It is"
42078,"delightful, and one could live on the name of Newton Priors for a"
42078,"twelvemonth. Indeed, I think you get on very fast. I only wish other"
42078,"people of my acquaintance could compose as rapidly. I am pleased with"
42078,"the dog scene and with the whole of George and Susan's love, but am more"
42078,"particularly struck with your serious conversations. They are very good"
42078,"throughout. St. Julian's history was quite a surprise to me. You had not"
42078,"very long known it yourself, I suspect; but I have no objection to make"
42078,"to the circumstance, and it is very well told. His having been in love"
42078,"with the aunt gives Cecilia an additional interest with him. I like the"
42078,"idea,--a very proper compliment to an aunt! I rather imagine indeed that"

42078,"Our visit to Hendon will interest you, I am sure; but I need not enter"

42078,"and her closet better than he can, but I do not feel that I can stop to"
42078,"do it. I was rather sorry to hear that she is to have an instrument; it"
42078,"seems throwing money away. They will wish the twenty-four guineas in the"

42078,"being got in secret, and not owned to anybody. I received a very kind"
42078,"note from her yesterday, to ask me to come again and stay a night with"
42078,"them. I cannot do it, but I was pleased to find that she had the power"
42078,"of doing so right a thing. My going was to give them both pleasure very"

42078,""
42078,"I just saw Mr. Hayter at the play, and think his face would please me on"
42078,"acquaintance. I was sorry he did not dine here. It seemed rather odd to"

42078,"myself, at leisure for all the agitated Isabella could raise."
42078,""
42078,"Now, my dearest Fanny, I will begin a subject which comes in very"
42078,"naturally. You frighten me out of my wits by your reference. Your"
42078,"affection gives me the highest pleasure, but indeed you must not let"
42078,"anything depend on my opinion; your own feelings, and none but your own,"
42078,"should determine such an important point. So far, however, as answering"
42078,"your question, I have no scruple. I am perfectly convinced that your"
42078,"present feelings, supposing that you were to marry now, would be"
42078,"sufficient for his happiness; but when I think how very, very far it is"
42078,"from a ""now,"" and take everything that may be into consideration, I dare"
42078,"not say, ""Determine to accept him;"" the risk is too great for you,"
42078,"unless your own sentiments prompt it."
42078,""
42078,"You will think me perverse, perhaps; in my last letter I was urging"
42078,"everything in his favor, and now I am inclining the other way, but I"
42078,"cannot help it; I am at present more impressed with the possible evil"
42078,"that may arise to you from engaging yourself to him--in word or"
42078,"mind--than with anything else. When I consider how few young men you"
42078,"have yet seen much of, how capable you are (yes, I do still think you"
42078,"very capable) of being really in love, and how full of temptation the"
42078,"next six or seven years of your life will probably be (it is the very"
42078,"period of life for the strongest attachments to be formed),--I cannot"
42078,"wish you, with your present very cool feelings, to devote yourself in"
42078,"honor to him. It is very true that you never may attach another man his"
42078,"equal altogether; but if that other man has the power of attaching you"
42078,"more, he will be in your eyes the most perfect."
42078,""
42078,"I shall be glad if you can revive past feelings, and from your unbiassed"
42078,"self resolve to go on as you have done, but this I do not expect; and"
42078,"without it I cannot wish you to be fettered. I should not be afraid of"
42078,"your marrying him; with all his worth you would soon love him enough for"
42078,"the happiness of both; but I should dread the continuance of this sort"
42078,"of tacit engagement, with such an uncertainty as there is of when it may"
42078,"be completed. Years may pass before he is independent; you like him well"
42078,"enough to marry, but not well enough to wait; the unpleasantness of"
42078,"appearing fickle is certainly great; but if you think you want"
42078,"punishment for past illusions, there it is, and nothing can be compared"
42078,"to the misery of being bound without love,--bound to one, and preferring"
42078,"another; that is a punishment which you do not deserve."
42078,""
42078,"I know you did not meet, or rather will not meet, to-day, as he called"
42078,"here yesterday; and I am glad of it. It does not seem very likely, at"
42078,"least, that he should be in time for a dinner visit sixty miles off. We"
42078,"did not see him, only found his card when we came home at four. Your"
42078,"Uncle H. merely observed that he was a day after ""the fair."" We asked"
42078,"your brother on Monday (when Mr. Hayter was talked of) why he did not"
42078,"invite him too; saying, ""I know he is in town, for I met him the other"

42078,"incessantly, with an interesting degree of lisp and indistinctness, and"
42078,"very likely may be the handsomest in time. Cassy did not show more"

42078,"MY DEAR ANNA,--We told Mr. B. Lefroy that if the weather did not prevent"
42078,"us we should certainly come and see you to-morrow and bring Cassy,"
42078,"trusting to your being good enough to give her a dinner about one"
42078,"o'clock, that we might be able to be with you the earlier and stay the"
42078,"longer. But on giving Cassy her choice between the Fair at Alton or"
42078,"Wyards, it must be confessed that she has preferred the former, which we"
42078,"trust will not greatly affront you; if it does, you may hope that some"
42078,"little Anne hereafter may revenge the insult by a similar preference of"
42078,"an Alton Fair to her Cousin Cassy. In the mean while we have determined"
42078,"to put off our visit to you until Monday, which we hope will be not less"
42078,"convenient. I wish the weather may not resolve on another put off. I"
42078,"must come to you before Wednesday if it be possible, for on that day I"
42078,"am going to London for a week or two with your Uncle Henry, who is"
42078,"expected here on Sunday. If Monday should appear too dirty for walking,"
42078,"and Mr. Lefroy would be so kind as to come and fetch me, I should be"

42078,"such danger that she wrote to Steventon to summon her father to town."
42078,"The letter was two days on the road, and reached him on Sunday the 24th."
42078,"Even then he did not start immediately. In the evening he and his wife"
42078,"rode to Chawton, and it was not until the next day that he and Cassandra"
42078,"arrived in Hans Place. The malady from which Henry Austen was suffering"
42078,"was low fever, and he was for some days at death's door: but he rallied"
42078,"soon after his brother and sisters arrived, and recovered so quickly"
42078,"that the former was able to leave him at the end of the week. The great"
42078,"anxiety and fatigue which Jane underwent at this time was supposed by"
42078,"some of her family to have broken down her health. She was in a very"
42078,"feeble and exhausted condition when the bank in which her brother Henry"
42078,"was a partner broke, and he not only lost all that he possessed, but"
42078,"most of his relations suffered severely also. Jane was well enough to"

42078,"have amused him, I am sure one part, alas! cannot be very amusing to"
42078,"anybody. I wonder that with such business to worry him he can be getting"
42078,"better; but he certainly does gain strength, and if you and Edwd. were"

42078,"he ventured first on the balcony and then as far as the greenhouse. He"
42078,"caught no cold, and therefore has done more to-day, with great delight"
42078,"and self-persuasion of improvement."
42078,""
42078,"He has been to see Mrs. Tilson and the Malings. By the by, you may talk"

42078,""
42078,"_Evening._--We have had no Edward. Our circle is formed,--only Mr."

42078,"drink tea with us to-morrow, and, as it was accepted, here is an end of"

42078,"MY DEAREST,--The parcel arrived safely, and I am much obliged to you for"

42078,"I might dedicate, etc., for fear of being obliged to do it, and that she"
42078,"is thoroughly convinced of my being influenced now by nothing but the"
42078,"most mercenary motives. I have paid nine shillings on her account to"

42078,"Well, we were very busy all yesterday; from half-past eleven till four"

42078,"and encountering the miseries of Grafton House to get a purple frock for"
42078,"Eleanor Bridges. We got to Keppel St., however, which was all I cared"
42078,"for; and though we could stay only a quarter of an hour, Fanny's calling"
42078,"gave great pleasure, and her sensibility still greater, for she was very"
42078,"much affected at the sight of the children. Poor little F. looked"

42078,"and myself making the best of it; on the opposite side Fanny and Mr."
42078,"Haden, in two chairs (I believe, at least, they had two chairs), talking"

42078,"case is, that when he goes to Oxford I should go home, and have nearly a"
42078,"week of you before you take my place. This is only a silent project, you"
42078,"know, to be gladly given up if better things occur. Henry calls himself"

42078,"attention at Hanwell, spent his two days there very quietly and"
42078,"pleasantly, and being certainly in no respect the worse for going, we"
42078,"may believe that he must be better, as he is quite sure of being"

42078,"Oh, thank you very much for your long letter; it did me a great deal of"
42078,"good. Henry accepts your offer of making his nine gallon of mead"
42078,"thankfully. The mistake of the dogs rather vexed him for a moment, but"
42078,"he has not thought of it since. To-day he makes a third attempt at his"
42078,"strengthening plaister, and as I am sure he will now be getting out a"
42078,"great deal, it is to be wished that he may be able to keep it on. He"

42078,"MY DEAREST FANNY,--You are inimitable, irresistible. You are the delight"
42078,"of my life. Such letters, such entertaining letters, as you have lately"
42078,"sent! such a description of your queer little heart! such a lovely"
42078,"display of what imagination does! You are worth your weight in gold, or"
42078,"even in the new silver coinage. I cannot express to you what I have felt"
42078,"in reading your history of yourself,--how full of pity and concern, and"
42078,"admiration and amusement I have been! You are the paragon of all that is"
42078,"silly and sensible, commonplace and eccentric, sad and lively, provoking"
42078,"and interesting. Who can keep pace with the fluctuations of your fancy,"
42078,"the capprizios of your taste, the contradictions of your feelings? You"
42078,"are so odd, and all the time so perfectly natural!--so peculiar in"
42078,"yourself, and yet so like everybody else!"
42078,""
42078,"It is very, very gratifying to me to know you so intimately. You can"
42078,"hardly think what a pleasure it is to me to have such thorough pictures"
42078,"of your heart. Oh, what a loss it will be when you are married! You are"
42078,"too agreeable in your single state,--too agreeable as a niece. I shall"
42078,"hate you when your delicious play of mind is all settled down into"
42078,"conjugal and maternal affections."
42078,""
42078,"Mr. B---- frightens me. He will have you. I see you at the altar. I have"
42078,"some faith in Mrs. C. Cage's observation, and still more in Lizzy's; and"
42078,"besides, I know it must be so. He must be wishing to attach you. It"
42078,"would be too stupid and too shameful in him to be otherwise; and all the"
42078,"family are seeking your acquaintance."
42078,""
42078,"Do not imagine that I have any real objection; I have rather taken a"
42078,"fancy to him than not, and I like the house for you. I only do not like"
42078,"you should marry anybody. And yet I do wish you to marry very much,"
42078,"because I know you will never be happy till you are; but the loss of a"
42078,"Fanny Knight will be never made up to me. My ""affec. niece F. C. B----"""
42078,"will be but a poor substitute. I do not like your being nervous, and so"
42078,"apt to cry,--it is a sign you are not quite well; but I hope Mr."
42078,"Scud--as you always write his name (your Mr. Scuds amuse me very"

42078,"What a comfort that Cassandra should be so recovered! It was more than"
42078,"we had expected. I can easily believe she was very patient and very"
42078,"good. I always loved Cassandra for her fine dark eyes and sweet temper."
42078,"I am almost entirely cured of my rheumatism,--just a little pain in my"
42078,"knee now and then, to make me remember what it was, and keep on flannel."
42078,"Aunt Cassandra nursed me so beautifully."
42078,""
42078,"I enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, it must be a great pleasure to you;"
42078,"you have not seen Fanny Cage in comfort so long. I hope she represents"
42078,"and remonstrates and reasons with you properly. Why should you be living"
42078,"in dread of his marrying somebody else? (Yet how natural!) You did not"
42078,"choose to have him yourself, why not allow him to take comfort where he"
42078,"can? In your conscience you know that he could not bear a companion with"
42078,"a more animated character. You cannot forget how you felt under the idea"
42078,"of its having been possible that he might have dined in Hans Place."
42078,""
42078,"My dearest Fanny, I cannot bear you should be unhappy about him. Think"
42078,"of his principles; think of his father's objection, of want of money,"
42078,"etc., etc. But I am doing no good; no, all that I urge against him will"
42078,"rather make you take his part more,--sweet, perverse Fanny."
42078,""
42078,"And now I will tell you that we like your Henry to the utmost, to the"
42078,"very top of the glass, quite brimful. He is a very pleasing young man. I"
42078,"do not see how he could be mended. He does really bid fair to be"
42078,"everything his father and sister could wish; and William I love very"
42078,"much indeed, and so we do all; he is quite our own William. In short, we"
42078,"are very comfortable together; that is, we can answer for ourselves."

42078,"Mrs. Deedes is as welcome as May to all our benevolence to her son; we"
42078,"only lamented that we could not do more, and that the 50_l._ note we"
42078,"slipped into his hand at parting was necessarily the limit of our"
42078,"offering. Good Mrs. Deedes! Scandal and gossip; yes, I dare say you are"

42078,"you for mentioning her praise of ""Emma,"" etc."

42078,"stare me in the face."

42078,"Much obliged for the quadrilles, which I am grown to think pretty"

42078,"Ben and Anna walked here last Sunday to hear Uncle Henry, and she looked"
42078,"so pretty, it was quite a pleasure to see her, so young and so blooming"
42078,"and so innocent, as if she had never had a wicked thought in her life,"
42078,"which yet one has some reason to suppose she must have had, if we"
42078,"believe the doctrine of original sin. I hope Lizzy will have her play"
42078,"very kindly arranged for her. Henry is generally thought very"
42078,"good-looking, but not so handsome as Edward. I think I prefer his face."
42078,"Wm. is in excellent looks, has a fine appetite, and seems perfectly"
42078,"well. You will have a great break up at Godmersham in the spring. You"
42078,"must feel their all going. It is very right, however! Poor Miss C.! I"
42078,"shall pity her when she begins to understand herself."
42078,""
42078,"Your objection to the quadrilles delighted me exceedingly. Pretty well,"
42078,"for a lady irrecoverably attached to one person! Sweet Fanny, believe no"
42078,"such thing of yourself, spread no such malicious slander upon your"
42078,"understanding within the precincts of your imagination. Do not speak ill"
42078,"of your sense merely for the gratification of your fancy; yours is sense"
42078,"which deserves more honorable treatment. You are not in love with him;"
42078,"you never have been really in love with him."

42078,""
42078,"AS to making any adequate return for such a letter as yours, my dearest"
42078,"Fanny, it is absolutely impossible. If I were to labor at it all the"
42078,"rest of my life, and live to the age of Methuselah, I could never"
42078,"accomplish anything so long and so perfect; but I cannot let William go"
42078,"without a few lines of acknowledgment and reply."
42078,""
42078,"I have pretty well done with Mr. ----. By your description, he cannot be"
42078,"in love with you, however he may try at it; and I could not wish the"
42078,"match unless there were a great deal of love on his side. I do not know"
42078,"what to do about Jemima Branfill. What does her dancing away with so"
42078,"much spirit mean? That she does not care for him, or only wishes to"
42078,"appear not to care for him? Who can understand a young lady?"
42078,""
42078,"Poor Mrs. C. Milles, that she should die on the wrong day at last, after"
42078,"being about it so long! It was unlucky that the Goodnestone party could"
42078,"not meet you; and I hope her friendly, obliging, social spirit, which"
42078,"delighted in drawing people together, was not conscious of the division"
42078,"and disappointment she was occasioning. I am sorry and surprised that"
42078,"you speak of her as having little to leave, and must feel for Miss"
42078,"Milles, though she is Molly, if a material loss of income is to attend"
42078,"her other loss. Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor,"
42078,"which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony; but I need not"
42078,"dwell on such arguments with you, pretty dear."
42078,""
42078,"To you I shall say, as I have often said before, Do not be in a hurry,"
42078,"the right man will come at last; you will in the course of the next two"
42078,"or three years meet with somebody more generally unexceptionable than"
42078,"any one you have yet known, who will love you as warmly as possible, and"
42078,"who will so completely attract you that you will feel you never really"
42078,"loved before."
42078,""
42078,"Do none of the A.'s ever come to balls now? You have never mentioned"
42078,"them as being at any. And what do you hear of the Gripps, or of Fanny"
42078,"and her husband?"
42078,""
42078,"Aunt Cassandra walked to Wyards yesterday with Mrs. Digweed. Anna has"

42078,"I have also heard lately from your Aunt Harriot, and cannot understand"
42078,"their plans in parting with Miss S., whom she seems very much to value"
42078,"now that Harriot and Eleanor are both of an age for a governess to be so"
42078,"useful to, especially as, when Caroline was sent to school some years,"
42078,"Miss Bell was still retained, though the others even then were nursery"
42078,"children. They have some good reason, I dare say, though I cannot"
42078,"penetrate it; and till I know what it is I shall invent a bad one, and"
42078,"amuse myself with accounting for the difference of measures by supposing"
42078,"Miss S. to be a superior sort of woman, who has never stooped to"
42078,"recommend herself to the master of the family by flattery, as Miss Bell"
42078,"did."

42078,"I will answer your kind questions more than you expect. ""Miss Catherine"""

42078,"perhaps, appear about a twelvemonth hence. It is short,--about the"

42078,"I am got tolerably well again, quite equal to walking about and enjoying"

42078,"get exercise enough. I have a scheme, however, for accomplishing more,"
42078,"as the weather grows spring-like. I mean to take to riding the donkey;"
42078,"it will be more independent and less troublesome than the use of the"
42078,"carriage, and I shall be able to go about with Aunt Cassandra in her"
42078,"walks to Alton and Wyards."
42078,""
42078,"I hope you will think Wm. looking well; he was bilious the other day,"

42078,"I AM very much obliged to you, my dearest Fanny, for sending me Mr. W.'s"

42078,"affronted, and do not think the worse of him for having a brain so very"
42078,"different from mine; but my strongest sensation of all is astonishment"
42078,"at your being able to press him on the subject so perseveringly; and I"
42078,"agree with your papa that it was not fair. When he knows the truth, he"
42078,"will be uncomfortable."
42078,""
42078,"You are the oddest creature! Nervous enough in some respects, but in"
42078,"others perfectly without nerves! Quite unrepulsable, hardened, and"
42078,"impudent. Do not oblige him to read any more. Have mercy on him, tell"
42078,"him the truth, and make him an apology. He and I should not in the least"
42078,"agree, of course, in our ideas of novels and heroines. Pictures of"
42078,"perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked; but there is some very"
42078,"good sense in what he says, and I particularly respect him for wishing"
42078,"to think well of all young ladies; it shows an amiable and a delicate"
42078,"mind. And he deserves better treatment than to be obliged to read any"
42078,"more of my works."
42078,""
42078,"Do not be surprised at finding Uncle Henry acquainted with my having"
42078,"another ready for publication. I could not say No when he asked me, but"
42078,"he knows nothing more of it. You will not like it, so you need not be"

42078,""
42078,"Many thanks for your kind care for my health; I certainly have not been"
42078,"well for many weeks, and about a week ago I was very poorly. I have had"
42078,"a good deal of fever at times, and indifferent nights; but I am"
42078,"considerably better now, and am recovering my looks a little, which have"
42078,"been bad enough,--black and white, and every wrong color. I must not"
42078,"depend upon being ever very blooming again. Sickness is a dangerous"
42078,"indulgence at my time of life. Thank you for everything you tell me. I"
42078,"do not feel worthy of it by anything that I can say in return, but I"
42078,"assure you my pleasure in your letters is quite as great as ever, and I"
42078,"am interested and amused just as you could wish me. If there is a Miss"
42078,"_Marsden_, I perceive whom she will marry."
42078,""
42078,"_Evening._--I was languid and dull and very bad company when I wrote the"
42078,"above; I am better now, to my own feelings at least, and wish I may be"
42078,"more agreeable. We are going to have rain, and after that very pleasant"
42078,"genial weather, which will exactly do for me, as my saddle will then be"
42078,"completed, and air and exercise is what I want. Indeed, I shall be very"
42078,"glad when the event at Scarlets is over, the expectation of it keeps us"
42078,"in a worry, your grandmamma especially; she sits brooding over evils"
42078,"which cannot be remedied, and conduct impossible to be understood."
42078,""
42078,"Now the reports from Keppel St. are rather better; little Harriot's"
42078,"headaches are abated, and Sir Evd. is satisfied with the effect of the"
42078,"mercury, and does not despair of a cure. The complaint I find is not"
42078,"considered incurable nowadays, provided the patient be young enough not"
42078,"to have the head hardened. The water in that case may be drawn off by"
42078,"mercury. But though this is a new idea to us, perhaps it may have been"
42078,"long familiar to you through your friend Mr. Scud. I hope his high"

42078,"as I do not venture to church. I cannot hear, however, but that they are"

42078,""
42078,"Old Philmore was buried yesterday, and I, by way of saying something to"
42078,"Triggs, observed that it had been a very handsome funeral; but his"
42078,"manner of reply made me suppose that it was not generally esteemed so. I"
42078,"can only be sure of one part being very handsome,--Triggs himself,"
42078,"walking behind in his green coat. Mrs. Philmore attended as chief"
42078,"mourner, in bombazine, made very short, and flounced with crape."

42078,"_Tuesday._--I have had various plans as to this letter, but at last I"

42078,"see how Canterbury looks in the direction. When once Uncle H. has left"

42078,"and he is always depressed by the idea of it. I hope he will be in time"
42078,"for your sick. I am sure he must do that part of his duty as excellently"
42078,"as all the rest. He returned yesterday from Steventon, and was with us"
42078,"by breakfast, bringing Edward with him, only that Edwd. stayed to"
42078,"breakfast at Wyards. We had a pleasant family day, for the Altons dined"

42078,"the waters agree, everything else is trifling."
42078,""
42078,"A letter arrived for you from Charles last Thursday. They are all safe"
42078,"and pretty well in Keppel St., the children decidedly better for"
42078,"Broadstairs; and he writes principally to ask when it will be convenient"
42078,"to us to receive Miss P., the little girls, and himself. They would be"
42078,"ready to set off in ten days from the time of his writing, to pay their"
42078,"visits in Hampshire and Berkshire, and he would prefer coming to Chawton"
42078,"first."
42078,""
42078,"I have answered him, and said that we hoped it might suit them to wait"
42078,"till the last week in Septr., as we could not ask them sooner, either on"
42078,"your account or the want of room. I mentioned the 23rd as the probable"
42078,"day of your return. When you have once left Cheltenham, I shall grudge"
42078,"every half-day wasted on the road. If there were but a coach from"
42078,"Hungerford to Chawton! I have desired him to let me hear again soon."
42078,""
42078,"He does not include a maid in the list to be accommodated; but if they"
42078,"bring one, as I suppose they will, we shall have no bed in the house"
42078,"even then for Charles himself,--let alone Henry. But what can we do?"
42078,""
42078,"We shall have the Gt. House quite at our command; it is to be cleared of"
42078,"the Papillons' servants in a day or two. They themselves have been"
42078,"hurried off into Essex to take possession,--not of a large estate left"
42078,"them by an uncle, but to scrape together all they can, I suppose, of the"
42078,"effects of a Mrs. Rawstorn, a rich old friend and cousin suddenly"
42078,"deceased, to whom they are joint executors. So there is a happy end of"
42078,"the Kentish Papillons coming here."
42078,""
42078,"No morning service to-day, wherefore I am writing between twelve and one"
42078,"o'clock. Mr. Benn in the afternoon, and likewise more rain again, by the"
42078,"look and the sound of things. You left us in doubt of Mrs. Benn's"
42078,"situation, but she has bespoke her nurse. . . . The F. A.'s dined with"
42078,"us yesterday, and had fine weather both for coming and going home, which"
42078,"has hardly ever happened to them before. She is still unprovided with a"
42078,"housemaid."
42078,""
42078,"Our day at Alton was very pleasant, venison quite right, children well"
42078,"behaved, and Mr. and Mrs. Digweed taking kindly to our charades and"
42078,"other games. I must also observe, for his mother's satisfaction, that"
42078,"Edward at my suggestion devoted himself very properly to the"
42078,"entertainment of Miss S. Gibson. Nothing was wanting except Mr. Sweeney;"
42078,"but he, alas! had been ordered away to London the day before. We had a"
42078,"beautiful walk home by moonlight."
42078,""
42078,"Thank you, my back has given me scarcely any pain for many days. I have"
42078,"an idea that agitation does it as much harm as fatigue, and that I was"
42078,"ill at the time of your going from the very circumstance of your going."
42078,"I am nursing myself up now into as beautiful a state as I can, because I"
42078,"hear that Dr. White means to call on me before he leaves the country."
42078,""
42078,"_Evening._--Frank and Mary and the children visited us this morning. Mr."
42078,"and Mrs. Gibson are to come on the 23rd, and there is too much reason to"
42078,"fear they will stay above a week. Little George could tell me where you"
42078,"were gone to, as well as what you were to bring him, when I asked him"
42078,"the other day."
42078,""
42078,"Sir Tho. Miller is dead. I treat you with a dead baronet in almost every"
42078,"letter."
42078,""
42078,"So you have C. Craven among you, as well as the Duke of Orleans and Mr."
42078,"Pocock. But it mortifies me that you have not added one to the stock of"
42078,"common acquaintance. Do pray meet with somebody belonging to yourself. I"
42078,"am quite weary of your knowing nobody."
42078,""
42078,"Mrs. Digweed parts with both Hannah and old cook: the former will not"
42078,"give up her lover, who is a man of bad character; the latter is guilty"
42078,"only of being unequal to anything."
42078,""
42078,"Miss Terry was to have spent this week with her sister, but as usual it"
42078,"is put off. My amiable friend knows the value of her company. I have not"
42078,"seen Anna since the day you left us; her father and brother visited her"
42078,"most days. Edward and Ben called here on Thursday. Edward was in his way"
42078,"to Selborne. We found him very agreeable. He is come back from France,"
42078,"thinking of the French as one could wish,--disappointed in everything."
42078,"He did not go beyond Paris."
42078,""
42078,"I have a letter from Mrs. Perigord; she and her mother are in London"
42078,"again. She speaks of France as a scene of general poverty and misery: no"
42078,"money, no trade, nothing to be got but by the innkeepers, and as to her"
42078,"own present prospects she is not much less melancholy than before."
42078,""
42078,"I have also a letter from Miss Sharp, quite one of her letters; she has"
42078,"been again obliged to exert herself more than ever, in a more"
42078,"distressing, more harassed state, and has met with another excellent old"
42078,"physician and his wife, with every virtue under heaven, who takes to her"
42078,"and cures her from pure love and benevolence. Dr. and Mrs. Storer are"
42078,"their Mrs. and Miss Palmer--for they are at Bridlington. I am happy to"
42078,"say, however, that the sum of the account is better than usual. Sir"
42078,"William is returned; from Bridlington they go to Chevet, and she is to"
42078,"have a young governess under her."
42078,""
42078,"I enjoyed Edward's company very much, as I said before, and yet I was"
42078,"not sorry when Friday came. It had been a busy week, and I wanted a few"
42078,"days' quiet and exemption from the thought and contrivancy which any"
42078,"sort of company gives. I often wonder how you can find time for what you"
42078,"do, in addition to the care of the house; and how good Mrs. West could"
42078,"have written such books and collected so many hard words, with all her"
42078,"family cares, is still more a matter of astonishment. Composition seems"
42078,"to me impossible with a head full of joints of mutton and doses of"
42078,"rhubarb."
42078,""
42078,"_Monday._--Here is a sad morning. I fear you may not have been able to"
42078,"get to the Pump. The two last days were very pleasant. I enjoyed them"
42078,"the more for your sake. But to-day it is really bad enough to make you"
42078,"all cross. I hope Mary will change her lodgings at the fortnight's end;"
42078,"I am sure, if you looked about well, you would find others in some odd"
42078,"corner to suit you better. Mrs. Potter charges for the name of the High"
42078,"St."
42078,""
42078,"Success to the pianoforte! I trust it will drive you away. We hear now"
42078,"that there is to be no honey this year. Bad news for us. We must"
42078,"husband our present stock of mead, and I am sorry to perceive that our"
42078,"twenty gallons is very nearly out. I cannot comprehend how the fourteen"
42078,"gallons could last so long."
42078,""
42078,"We do not much like Mr. Cooper's new sermons. They are fuller of"
42078,"regeneration and conversion than ever, with the addition of his zeal in"
42078,"the cause of the Bible Society."
42078,""
42078,"Martha's love to Mary and Caroline, and she is extremely glad to find"
42078,"they like the pelisse. The Debarys are indeed odious! We are to see my"

42078,"care for the races without Edward. Remember me to all."

42078,""
42078,"In January, 1817, she wrote of herself as better and able to walk into"
42078,"Alton, and hoped in the summer she should be able to walk back. In April"
42078,"her father in a note to Mrs. Lefroy says: ""I was happy to have a good"
42078,"account of herself written by her own hand, in a letter from your Aunt"
42078,"Jane; but all who love, and that is all who know her, must be anxious on"
42078,"her account."" We all know how well grounded that anxiety was, and how"
42078,"soon her relations had to lament over the loss of the dearest and"
42078,"brightest member of their family."
42078,""
42078,"And now I come to the saddest letters of all, those which tell us of the"
42078,"end of that bright life, cut short just at the time when the world might"
42078,"have hoped that unabated intellectual vigor, supplemented by the"
42078,"experience brought by maturer years, would have produced works if"
42078,"possible even more fascinating than those with which she had already"
42078,"embellished the literature of her country. But it was not to be. The"
42078,"fiat had gone forth,--the ties which bound that sweet spirit to earth"
42078,"were to be severed, and a blank left, never to be filled in the family"
42078,"which her loved and loving presence had blessed, and where she had been"
42078,"so well and fondly appreciated. In the early spring of 1817 the"
42078,"unfavorable symptoms increased, and the failure of her health was too"
42078,"visible to be neglected. Still no apprehensions of immediate danger were"
42078,"entertained, and it is probable that when she left Chawton for"
42078,"Winchester in May, she did not recognize the fact that she was bidding a"
42078,"last farewell to ""Home."" Happy for her if it was so, for there are few"
42078,"things more melancholy than to look upon any beloved place or person"
42078,"with the knowledge that it is for ""the last time."" In all probability"
42078,"this grief was spared to Jane, for even after her arrival at Winchester"

42078,"good stead, and enabled her to bear it with fortitude. The firm and"

42078,"MY DEAREST FANNY,--Doubly dear to me now for her dear sake whom we have"
42078,"lost. She did love you most sincerely, and never shall I forget the"
42078,"proofs of love you gave her during her illness in writing those kind,"
42078,"amusing letters at a time when I know your feelings would have dictated"
42078,"so different a style. Take the only reward I can give you in the"
42078,"assurance that your benevolent purpose was answered; you did contribute"
42078,"to her enjoyment."
42078,""
42078,"Even your last letter afforded pleasure. I merely cut the seal and gave"
42078,"it to her; she opened it and read it herself, afterwards she gave it to"
42078,"me to read, and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully of its"
42078,"contents, but there was then a languor about her which prevented her"
42078,"taking the same interest in anything she had been used to do."
42078,""
42078,"Since Tuesday evening, when her complaint returned, there was a visible"
42078,"change, she slept more and much more comfortably; indeed, during the"
42078,"last eight-and-forty hours she was more asleep than awake. Her looks"
42078,"altered and she fell away, but I perceived no material diminution of"
42078,"strength, and though I was then hopeless of a recovery, I had no"
42078,"suspicion how rapidly my loss was approaching."
42078,""
42078,"I have lost a treasure, such a sister, such a friend as never can have"
42078,"been surpassed. She was the sun of my life, the gilder of every"
42078,"pleasure, the soother of every sorrow; I had not a thought concealed"
42078,"from her, and it is as if I had lost a part of myself. I loved her only"
42078,"too well,--not better than she deserved, but I am conscious that my"
42078,"affection for her made me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others;"
42078,"and I can acknowledge, more than as a general principle, the justice of"
42078,"the Hand which has struck this blow."
42078,""
42078,"You know me too well to be at all afraid that I should suffer materially"
42078,"from my feelings; I am perfectly conscious of the extent of my"
42078,"irreparable loss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little"
42078,"indisposed,--nothing but what a short time, with rest and change of air,"
42078,"will remove. I thank God that I was enabled to attend her to the last,"
42078,"and amongst my many causes of self-reproach I have not to add any wilful"
42078,"neglect of her comfort."
42078,""
42078,"She felt herself to be dying about half an hour before she became"
42078,"tranquil and apparently unconscious. During that half-hour was her"
42078,"struggle, poor soul! She said she could not tell us what she suffered,"
42078,"though she complained of little fixed pain. When I asked her if there"
42078,"was anything she wanted, her answer was she wanted nothing but death,"
42078,"and some of her words were: ""God grant me patience, pray for me, oh,"
42078,"pray for me!"" Her voice was affected, but as long as she spoke she was"
42078,"intelligible."
42078,""
42078,"I hope I do not break your heart, my dearest Fanny, by these"
42078,"particulars; I mean to afford you gratification whilst I am relieving my"
42078,"own feelings. I could not write so to anybody else; indeed you are the"
42078,"only person I have written to at all, excepting your grandmamma,--it"
42078,"was to her, not your Uncle Charles, I wrote on Friday."
42078,""
42078,"Immediately after dinner on Thursday I went into the town to do an"
42078,"errand which your dear aunt was anxious about. I returned about a"
42078,"quarter before six, and found her recovering from faintness and"
42078,"oppression; she got so well as to be able to give me a minute account of"
42078,"her seizure, and when the clock struck six she was talking quietly to"
42078,"me."
42078,""
42078,"I cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized again with the same"
42078,"faintness, which was followed by the sufferings she could not describe;"
42078,"but Mr. Lyford had been sent for, had applied something to give her"
42078,"ease, and she was in a state of quiet insensibility by seven o'clock at"
42078,"the latest. From that time till half-past four, when she ceased to"
42078,"breathe, she scarcely moved a limb, so that we have every reason to"
42078,"think, with gratitude to the Almighty, that her sufferings were over. A"
42078,"slight motion of the head with every breath remained till almost the"
42078,"last. I sat close to her with a pillow in my lap to assist in supporting"
42078,"her head, which was almost off the bed, for six hours; fatigue made me"
42078,"then resign my place to Mrs. J. A. for two hours and a half, when I took"
42078,"it again, and in about an hour more she breathed her last."
42078,""
42078,"I was able to close her eyes myself, and it was a great gratification to"
42078,"me to render her those last services. There was nothing convulsed which"
42078,"gave the idea of pain in her look; on the contrary, but for the"
42078,"continual motion of the head she gave one the idea of a beautiful"
42078,"statue, and even now, in her coffin, there is such a sweet, serene air"
42078,"over her countenance as is quite pleasant to contemplate."
42078,""
42078,"This day, my dearest Fanny, you have had the melancholy intelligence,"
42078,"and I know you suffer severely, but I likewise know that you will apply"
42078,"to the fountain-head for consolation, and that our merciful God is never"
42078,"deaf to such prayers as you will offer."
42078,""
42078,"The last sad ceremony is to take place on Thursday morning; her dear"
42078,"remains are to be deposited in the cathedral. It is a satisfaction to me"
42078,"to think that they are to lie in a building she admired so much; her"
42078,"precious soul, I presume to hope, reposes in a far superior mansion. May"

42078,"o'clock, as the cathedral service begins at that hour, so that we shall"

42078,"her; and if the dear angel is conscious of what passes here, and is not"
42078,"above all earthly feelings, she may perhaps receive pleasure in being so"
42078,"mourned. Had she been the survivor, I can fancy her speaking of you in"
42078,"almost the same terms. There are certainly many points of strong"

42078,"sight, and I had lost her forever, even then I was not overpowered, nor"
42078,"so much agitated as I am now in writing of it. Never was human being"
42078,"more sincerely mourned by those who attended her remains than was this"
42078,"dear creature. May the sorrow with which she is parted with on earth be"
42078,"a prognostic of the joy with which she is hailed in heaven!"

42078,"I continue very tolerably well,--much better than any one could have"
42078,"supposed possible, because I certainly have had considerable fatigue of"
42078,"body as well as anguish of mind for months back; but I really am well,"
42078,"and I hope I am properly grateful to the Almighty for having been so"
42078,"supported. Your grandmamma, too, is much better than when I came home."

42078,"I did not think your dear papa appeared unwell, and I understand that he"
42078,"seemed much more comfortable after his return from Winchester than he"
42078,"had done before. I need not tell you that he was a great comfort to me;"
42078,"indeed, I can never say enough of the kindness I have received from him"
42078,"and from every other friend."

42078,"I get out of doors a good deal, and am able to employ myself. Of course"
42078,"those employments suit me best which leave me most at leisure to think"
42078,"of her I have lost, and I do think of her in every variety of"
42078,"circumstance,--in our happy hours of confidential intercourse, in the"
42078,"cheerful family party which she so ornamented, in her sick-room, on her"
42078,"death-bed, and as (I hope) an inhabitant of heaven. Oh, if I may one day"
42078,"be reunited to her there! I know the time must come when my mind will be"
42078,"less engrossed by her idea, but I do not like to think of it. If I think"
42078,"of her less as on earth, God grant that I may never cease to reflect on"
42078,"her as inhabiting heaven, and never cease my humble endeavors (when it"
42078,"shall please God) to join her there."

42078,"In looking at a few of the precious papers which are now my property I"
42078,"have found some memorandums, amongst which she desires that one of her"
42078,"gold chains may be given to her god-daughter Louisa, and a lock of her"
42078,"hair be set for you. You can need no assurance, my dearest Fanny, that"
42078,"every request of your beloved aunt will be sacred with me. Be so good as"
