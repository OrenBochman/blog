5230,"THE STRANGE MAN’S ARRIVAL"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting"
5230,"wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down,"
5230,"walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black"
5230,"portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to"
5230,"foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but"
5230,"the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his"
5230,"shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried."
5230,"He staggered into the “Coach and Horses” more dead than alive, and"
5230,"flung his portmanteau down. “A fire,” he cried, “in the name of human"
5230,"charity! A room and a fire!” He stamped and shook the snow from off"
5230,"himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to"
5230,"strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple"
5230,"of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn."
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him"
5230,"a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime"
5230,"was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no"
5230,"“haggler,” and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good"
5230,"fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her"
5230,"lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen"
5230,"expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses"
5230,"into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _éclat_."
5230,"Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that"
5230,"her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her"
5230,"and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard. His"
5230,"gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in"
5230,"thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his"
5230,"shoulders dripped upon her carpet. “Can I take your hat and coat, sir?”"
5230,"she said, “and give them a good dry in the kitchen?”"
5230,""
5230,"“No,” he said without turning."
5230,""
5230,"She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her"
5230,"question."
5230,""
5230,"He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. “I prefer to"
5230,"keep them on,” he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big"
5230,"blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his"
5230,"coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face."
5230,""
5230,"“Very well, sir,” she said. “_As_ you like. In a bit the room will be"
5230,"warmer.”"
5230,""
5230,"He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and"
5230,"Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed,"
5230,"laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out"
5230,"of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like a man"
5230,"of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim"
5230,"turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put down the eggs"
5230,"and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to"
5230,"him, “Your lunch is served, sir.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Thank you,” he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was"
5230,"closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a"
5230,"certain eager quickness."
5230,""
5230,"As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at"
5230,"regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon"
5230,"being rapidly whisked round a basin. “That girl!” she said. “There! I"
5230,"clean forgot it. It’s her being so long!” And while she herself"
5230,"finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her"
5230,"excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table,"
5230,"and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in"
5230,"delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and wanting to stay! Then she"
5230,"filled the mustard pot, and, putting it with a certain stateliness upon"
5230,"a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into the parlour."
5230,""
5230,"She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved"
5230,"quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing"
5230,"behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the"
5230,"floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she"
5230,"noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in"
5230,"front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel"
5230,"fender. She went to these things resolutely. “I suppose I may have them"
5230,"to dry now,” she said in a voice that brooked no denial."
5230,""
5230,"“Leave the hat,” said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she"
5230,"saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her."
5230,""
5230,"For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak."
5230,""
5230,"He held a white cloth—it was a serviette he had brought with him—over"
5230,"the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were completely"
5230,"hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice. But it was not"
5230,"that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact that all his forehead"
5230,"above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another"
5230,"covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting"
5230,"only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it"
5230,"had been at first. He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high,"
5230,"black, linen-lined collar turned up about his neck. The thick black"
5230,"hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages,"
5230,"projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest"
5230,"appearance conceivable. This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike"
5230,"what she had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid."
5230,""
5230,"He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw"
5230,"now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable"
5230,"blue glasses. “Leave the hat,” he said, speaking very distinctly"
5230,"through the white cloth."
5230,""
5230,"Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She"
5230,"placed the hat on the chair again by the fire. “I didn’t know, sir,”"
5230,"she began, “that—” and she stopped embarrassed."
5230,""
5230,"“Thank you,” he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then at"
5230,"her again."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,” she said, and carried his"
5230,"clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue"
5230,"goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was"
5230,"still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the"
5230,"door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and"
5230,"perplexity. “I _never_,” she whispered. “There!” She went quite softly"
5230,"to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was"
5230,"messing about with _now_, when she got there."
5230,""
5230,"The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced"
5230,"inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed"
5230,"his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took"
5230,"another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette in his hand,"
5230,"walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the"
5230,"white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This left the room in a"
5230,"twilight. This done, he returned with an easier air to the table and"
5230,"his meal."
5230,""
5230,"“The poor soul’s had an accident or an op’ration or somethin’,” said"
5230,"Mrs. Hall. “What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!”"
5230,""
5230,"She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the"
5230,"traveller’s coat upon this. “And they goggles! Why, he looked more like"
5230,"a divin’ helmet than a human man!” She hung his muffler on a corner of"
5230,"the horse. “And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time."
5230,"Talkin’ through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was hurt too—maybe.”"
5230,""
5230,"She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. “Bless my soul alive!”"
5230,"she said, going off at a tangent; “ain’t you done them taters _yet_,"
5230,"Millie?”"
5230,""
5230,"When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger’s lunch, her idea that"
5230,"his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she"
5230,"supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a"
5230,"pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the"
5230,"silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the"
5230,"mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for she saw he"
5230,"glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner with his back"
5230,"to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being"
5230,"comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before."
5230,"The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big"
5230,"spectacles they had lacked hitherto."
5230,""
5230,"“I have some luggage,” he said, “at Bramblehurst station,” and he asked"
5230,"her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head quite"
5230,"politely in acknowledgment of her explanation. “To-morrow?” he said."
5230,"“There is no speedier delivery?” and seemed quite disappointed when she"
5230,"answered, “No.” Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who would go"
5230,"over?"
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a"
5230,"conversation. “It’s a steep road by the down, sir,” she said in answer"
5230,"to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said,"
5230,"“It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A"
5230,"gentleman killed, besides his coachman. Accidents, sir, happen in a"
5230,"moment, don’t they?”"
5230,""
5230,"But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. “They do,” he said"
5230,"through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable"
5230,"glasses."
5230,""
5230,"“But they take long enough to get well, don’t they? ... There was my"
5230,"sister’s son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in the"
5230,"’ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir. You’d hardly"
5230,"believe it. It’s regular given me a dread of a scythe, sir.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I can quite understand that,” said the visitor."
5230,""
5230,"“He was afraid, one time, that he’d have to have an op’ration—he was"
5230,"that bad, sir.”"
5230,""
5230,"The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite"
5230,"and kill in his mouth. “_Was_ he?” he said."
5230,""
5230,"“He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him,"
5230,"as I had—my sister being took up with her little ones so much. There"
5230,"was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that if I may make so"
5230,"bold as to say it, sir—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Will you get me some matches?” said the visitor, quite abruptly. “My"
5230,"pipe is out.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him, after"
5230,"telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment, and"
5230,"remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches."
5230,""
5230,"“Thanks,” he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his"
5230,"shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether"
5230,"too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations"
5230,"and bandages. She did not “make so bold as to say,” however, after all."
5230,"But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it"
5230,"that afternoon."
5230,""
5230,"The visitor remained in the parlour until four o’clock, without giving"
5230,"the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part he was quite"
5230,"still during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness"
5230,"smoking in the firelight—perhaps dozing."
5230,""
5230,"Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and"
5230,"for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room. He seemed"
5230,"to be talking to himself. Then the armchair creaked as he sat down"
5230,"again."
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"CHAPTER II."
5230,"MR. TEDDY HENFREY’S FIRST IMPRESSIONS"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"At four o’clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up"
5230,"her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea,"
5230,"Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. “My sakes! Mrs."
5230,"Hall,” said he, “but this is terrible weather for thin boots!” The snow"
5230,"outside was falling faster."
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him. “Now you’re"
5230,"here, Mr. Teddy,” said she, “I’d be glad if you’d give th’ old clock in"
5230,"the parlour a bit of a look. ’Tis going, and it strikes well and"
5230,"hearty; but the hour-hand won’t do nuthin’ but point at six.”"
5230,""
5230,"And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped and"
5230,"entered."
5230,""
5230,"Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the armchair"
5230,"before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping"
5230,"on one side. The only light in the room was the red glow from the"
5230,"fire—which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his"
5230,"downcast face in darkness—and the scanty vestiges of the day that came"
5230,"in through the open door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct"
5230,"to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and"
5230,"her eyes were dazzled. But for a second it seemed to her that the man"
5230,"she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open—a vast and incredible"
5230,"mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was"
5230,"the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle"
5230,"eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred, started up in his"
5230,"chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the room was"
5230,"lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his"
5230,"face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows,"
5230,"she fancied, had tricked her."
5230,""
5230,"“Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?” she"
5230,"said, recovering from the momentary shock."
5230,""
5230,"“Look at the clock?” he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and"
5230,"speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake,"
5230,"“certainly.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself."
5230,"Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was confronted by"
5230,"this bandaged person. He was, he says, “taken aback.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Good afternoon,” said the stranger, regarding him—as Mr. Henfrey says,"
5230,"with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles—“like a lobster.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I hope,” said Mr. Henfrey, “that it’s no intrusion.”"
5230,""
5230,"“None whatever,” said the stranger. “Though, I understand,” he said"
5230,"turning to Mrs. Hall, “that this room is really to be mine for my own"
5230,"private use.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I thought, sir,” said Mrs. Hall, “you’d prefer the clock—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Certainly,” said the stranger, “certainly—but, as a rule, I like to be"
5230,"alone and undisturbed."
5230,""
5230,"“But I’m really glad to have the clock seen to,” he said, seeing a"
5230,"certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey’s manner. “Very glad.” Mr. Henfrey"
5230,"had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation reassured"
5230,"him. The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put"
5230,"his hands behind his back. “And presently,” he said, “when the"
5230,"clock-mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea. But not"
5230,"till the clock-mending is over.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room—she made no conversational"
5230,"advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front of"
5230,"Mr. Henfrey—when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements"
5230,"about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had mentioned the"
5230,"matter to the postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on"
5230,"the morrow. “You are certain that is the earliest?” he said."
5230,""
5230,"She was certain, with a marked coldness."
5230,""
5230,"“I should explain,” he added, “what I was really too cold and fatigued"
5230,"to do before, that I am an experimental investigator.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Hall, much impressed."
5230,""
5230,"“And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Very useful things indeed they are, sir,” said Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“And I’m very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Of course, sir.”"
5230,""
5230,"“My reason for coming to Iping,” he proceeded, with a certain"
5230,"deliberation of manner, “was ... a desire for solitude. I do not wish"
5230,"to be disturbed in my work. In addition to my work, an accident—”"
5230,""
5230,"“I thought as much,” said Mrs. Hall to herself."
5230,""
5230,"“—necessitates a certain retirement. My eyes—are sometimes so weak and"
5230,"painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together."
5230,"Lock myself up. Sometimes—now and then. Not at present, certainly. At"
5230,"such times the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the"
5230,"room, is a source of excruciating annoyance to me—it is well these"
5230,"things should be understood.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Certainly, sir,” said Mrs. Hall. “And if I might make so bold as to"
5230,"ask—”"
5230,""
5230,"“That I think, is all,” said the stranger, with that quietly"
5230,"irresistible air of finality he could assume at will. Mrs. Hall"
5230,"reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion."
5230,""
5230,"After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the"
5230,"fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr."
5230,"Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but"
5230,"extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and"
5230,"unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to him,"
5230,"and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon"
5230,"the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy. When he"
5230,"looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being constitutionally of"
5230,"a curious nature, he had removed the works—a quite unnecessary"
5230,"proceeding—with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling"
5230,"into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood there,"
5230,"perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey’s nerves. He"
5230,"felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the"
5230,"bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of"
5230,"green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey"
5230,"that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another. Then"
5230,"Henfrey looked down again. Very uncomfortable position! One would like"
5230,"to say something. Should he remark that the weather was very cold for"
5230,"the time of year?"
5230,""
5230,"He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot. “The"
5230,"weather—” he began."
5230,""
5230,"“Why don’t you finish and go?” said the rigid figure, evidently in a"
5230,"state of painfully suppressed rage. “All you’ve got to do is to fix the"
5230,"hour-hand on its axle. You’re simply humbugging—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Certainly, sir—one minute more. I overlooked—” and Mr. Henfrey"
5230,"finished and went."
5230,""
5230,"But he went feeling excessively annoyed. “Damn it!” said Mr. Henfrey to"
5230,"himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow; “a man"
5230,"must do a clock at times, surely.”"
5230,""
5230,"And again, “Can’t a man look at you?—Ugly!”"
5230,""
5230,"And yet again, “Seemingly not. If the police was wanting you you"
5230,"couldn’t be more wropped and bandaged.”"
5230,""
5230,"At Gleeson’s corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the"
5230,"stranger’s hostess at the “Coach and Horses,” and who now drove the"
5230,"Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to Sidderbridge"
5230,"Junction, coming towards him on his return from that place. Hall had"
5230,"evidently been “stopping a bit” at Sidderbridge, to judge by his"
5230,"driving. “’Ow do, Teddy?” he said, passing."
5230,""
5230,"“You got a rum un up home!” said Teddy."
5230,""
5230,"Hall very sociably pulled up. “What’s that?” he asked."
5230,""
5230,"“Rum-looking customer stopping at the ‘Coach and Horses,’” said Teddy."
5230,"“My sakes!”"
5230,""
5230,"And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque"
5230,"guest. “Looks a bit like a disguise, don’t it? I’d like to see a man’s"
5230,"face if I had him stopping in _my_ place,” said Henfrey. “But women are"
5230,"that trustful—where strangers are concerned. He’s took your rooms and"
5230,"he ain’t even given a name, Hall.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You don’t say so!” said Hall, who was a man of sluggish apprehension."
5230,""
5230,"“Yes,” said Teddy. “By the week. Whatever he is, you can’t get rid of"
5230,"him under the week. And he’s got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow, so"
5230,"he says. Let’s hope it won’t be stones in boxes, Hall.”"
5230,""
5230,"He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger"
5230,"with empty portmanteaux. Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious."
5230,"“Get up, old girl,” said Hall. “I s’pose I must see ’bout this.”"
5230,""
5230,"Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved."
5230,""
5230,"Instead of “seeing ’bout it,” however, Hall on his return was severely"
5230,"rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge,"
5230,"and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to"
5230,"the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the"
5230,"mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements. “You wim’ don’t"
5230,"know everything,” said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the"
5230,"personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And"
5230,"after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine,"
5230,"Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard"
5230,"at his wife’s furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn’t master"
5230,"there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of"
5230,"mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring for the"
5230,"night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger’s"
5230,"luggage when it came next day."
5230,""
5230,"“You mind your own business, Hall,” said Mrs. Hall, “and I’ll mind"
5230,"mine.”"
5230,""
5230,"She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was"
5230,"undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no"
5230,"means assured about him in her own mind. In the middle of the night she"
5230,"woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that came trailing"
5230,"after her, at the end of interminable necks, and with vast black eyes."
5230,"But being a sensible woman, she subdued her terrors and turned over and"
5230,"went to sleep again."

5230,"CHAPTER III."
5230,"THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of"
5230,"the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village."
5230,"Next day his luggage arrived through the slush—and very remarkable"
5230,"luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a"
5230,"rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books—big,"
5230,"fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible"
5230,"handwriting—and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing"
5230,"objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual"
5230,"curiosity at the straw—glass bottles. The stranger, muffled in hat,"
5230,"coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet Fearenside’s"
5230,"cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to"
5230,"helping bring them in. Out he came, not noticing Fearenside’s dog, who"
5230,"was sniffing in a _dilettante_ spirit at Hall’s legs. “Come along with"
5230,"those boxes,” he said. “I’ve been waiting long enough.”"
5230,""
5230,"And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay"
5230,"hands on the smaller crate."
5230,""
5230,"No sooner had Fearenside’s dog caught sight of him, however, than it"
5230,"began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps"
5230,"it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand. “Whup!”"
5230,"cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside"
5230,"howled, “Lie down!” and snatched his whip."
5230,""
5230,"They saw the dog’s teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the"
5230,"dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger’s leg, and"
5230,"heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside’s"
5230,"whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated"
5230,"under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift"
5230,"half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger glanced"
5230,"swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would stoop to"
5230,"the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn."
5230,"They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted"
5230,"stairs to his bedroom."
5230,""
5230,"“You brute, you!” said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his"
5230,"whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel. “Come"
5230,"here,” said Fearenside—“You’d better.”"
5230,""
5230,"Hall had stood gaping. “He wuz bit,” said Hall. “I’d better go and see"
5230,"to en,” and he trotted after the stranger. He met Mrs. Hall in the"
5230,"passage. “Carrier’s darg,” he said “bit en.”"
5230,""
5230,"He went straight upstairs, and the stranger’s door being ajar, he"
5230,"pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a"
5230,"naturally sympathetic turn of mind."
5230,""
5230,"The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most"
5230,"singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a"
5230,"face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of"
5230,"a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled back,"
5230,"and the door slammed in his face and locked. It was so rapid that it"
5230,"gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable shapes, a blow,"
5230,"and a concussion. There he stood on the dark little landing, wondering"
5230,"what it might be that he had seen."
5230,""
5230,"A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed"
5230,"outside the “Coach and Horses.” There was Fearenside telling about it"
5230,"all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog"
5230,"didn’t have no business to bite her guests; there was Huxter, the"
5230,"general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers"
5230,"from the forge, judicial; besides women and children, all of them"
5230,"saying fatuities: “Wouldn’t let en bite _me_, I knows”; “’Tasn’t right"
5230,"_have_ such dargs”; “Whad ’_e_ bite ’n for, then?” and so forth."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it"
5230,"incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen"
5230,"upstairs. Besides, his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express"
5230,"his impressions."
5230,""
5230,"“He don’t want no help, he says,” he said in answer to his wife’s"
5230,"inquiry. “We’d better be a-takin’ of his luggage in.”"
5230,""
5230,"“He ought to have it cauterised at once,” said Mr. Huxter; “especially"
5230,"if it’s at all inflamed.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’d shoot en, that’s what I’d do,” said a lady in the group."
5230,""
5230,"Suddenly the dog began growling again."
5230,""
5230,"“Come along,” cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood the"
5230,"muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim bent down."
5230,"“The sooner you get those things in the better I’ll be pleased.” It is"
5230,"stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been"
5230,"changed."
5230,""
5230,"“Was you hurt, sir?” said Fearenside. “I’m rare sorry the darg—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not a bit,” said the stranger. “Never broke the skin. Hurry up with"
5230,"those things.”"
5230,""
5230,"He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts."
5230,""
5230,"Directly the first crate was, in accordance with his directions,"
5230,"carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with"
5230,"extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw"
5230,"with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall’s carpet. And from it he began to"
5230,"produce bottles—little fat bottles containing powders, small and"
5230,"slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue"
5230,"bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks,"
5230,"large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with"
5230,"glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine corks, bottles"
5230,"with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil"
5230,"bottles—putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the"
5230,"table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf—everywhere."
5230,"The chemist’s shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite"
5230,"a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were"
5230,"empty and the table high with straw; the only things that came out of"
5230,"these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a"
5230,"carefully packed balance."
5230,""
5230,"And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the window"
5230,"and set to work, not troubling in the least about the litter of straw,"
5230,"the fire which had gone out, the box of books outside, nor for the"
5230,"trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs."
5230,""
5230,"When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so absorbed in"
5230,"his work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes, that"
5230,"he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and"
5230,"put the tray on the table, with some little emphasis perhaps, seeing"
5230,"the state that the floor was in. Then he half turned his head and"
5230,"immediately turned it away again. But she saw he had removed his"
5230,"glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it seemed to her that"
5230,"his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow. He put on his spectacles"
5230,"again, and then turned and faced her. She was about to complain of the"
5230,"straw on the floor when he anticipated her."
5230,""
5230,"“I wish you wouldn’t come in without knocking,” he said in the tone of"
5230,"abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him."
5230,""
5230,"“I knocked, but seemingly—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Perhaps you did. But in my investigations—my really very urgent and"
5230,"necessary investigations—the slightest disturbance, the jar of a door—I"
5230,"must ask you—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Certainly, sir. You can turn the lock if you’re like that, you know."
5230,"Any time.”"
5230,""
5230,"“A very good idea,” said the stranger."
5230,""
5230,"“This stror, sir, if I might make so bold as to remark—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t. If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill.” And he"
5230,"mumbled at her—words suspiciously like curses."
5230,""
5230,"He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle in"
5230,"one hand and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed."
5230,"But she was a resolute woman. “In which case, I should like to know,"
5230,"sir, what you consider—”"
5230,""
5230,"“A shilling—put down a shilling. Surely a shilling’s enough?”"
5230,""
5230,"“So be it,” said Mrs. Hall, taking up the table-cloth and beginning to"
5230,"spread it over the table. “If you’re satisfied, of course—”"
5230,""
5230,"He turned and sat down, with his coat-collar toward her."
5230,""
5230,"All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs. Hall"
5230,"testifies, for the most part in silence. But once there was a"
5230,"concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table"
5230,"had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down, and then"
5230,"a rapid pacing athwart the room. Fearing “something was the matter,”"
5230,"she went to the door and listened, not caring to knock."
5230,""
5230,"“I can’t go on,” he was raving. “I _can’t_ go on. Three hundred"
5230,"thousand, four hundred thousand! The huge multitude! Cheated! All my"
5230,"life it may take me! ... Patience! Patience indeed! ... Fool! fool!”"
5230,""
5230,"There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs. Hall"
5230,"had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy. When she"
5230,"returned the room was silent again, save for the faint crepitation of"
5230,"his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle. It was all over; the"
5230,"stranger had resumed work."
5230,""
5230,"When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room"
5230,"under the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been carelessly"
5230,"wiped. She called attention to it."
5230,""
5230,"“Put it down in the bill,” snapped her visitor. “For God’s sake don’t"
5230,"worry me. If there’s damage done, put it down in the bill,” and he went"
5230,"on ticking a list in the exercise book before him."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll tell you something,” said Fearenside, mysteriously. It was late"
5230,"in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping"
5230,"Hanger."
5230,""
5230,"“Well?” said Teddy Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"“This chap you’re speaking of, what my dog bit. Well—he’s black."
5230,"Leastways, his legs are. I seed through the tear of his trousers and"
5230,"the tear of his glove. You’d have expected a sort of pinky to show,"
5230,"wouldn’t you? Well—there wasn’t none. Just blackness. I tell you, he’s"
5230,"as black as my hat.”"
5230,""
5230,"“My sakes!” said Henfrey. “It’s a rummy case altogether. Why, his nose"
5230,"is as pink as paint!”"
5230,""
5230,"“That’s true,” said Fearenside. “I knows that. And I tell ’ee what I’m"
5230,"thinking. That marn’s a piebald, Teddy. Black here and white there—in"
5230,"patches. And he’s ashamed of it. He’s a kind of half-breed, and the"
5230,"colour’s come off patchy instead of mixing. I’ve heard of such things"
5230,"before. And it’s the common way with horses, as any one can see.”"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"CHAPTER IV."
5230,"MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"I have told the circumstances of the stranger’s arrival in Iping with a"
5230,"certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he"
5230,"created may be understood by the reader. But excepting two odd"
5230,"incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of"
5230,"the club festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a"
5230,"number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline,"
5230,"but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury"
5230,"began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment. Hall"
5230,"did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability"
5230,"of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing"
5230,"it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. “Wait"
5230,"till the summer,” said Mrs. Hall sagely, “when the artisks are"
5230,"beginning to come. Then we’ll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but"
5230,"bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you’d like"
5230,"to say.”"
5230,""
5230,"The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference"
5230,"between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He worked, as"
5230,"Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would come down early"
5230,"and be continuously busy. On others he would rise late, pace his room,"
5230,"fretting audibly for hours together, smoke, sleep in the armchair by"
5230,"the fire. Communication with the world beyond the village he had none."
5230,"His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was"
5230,"that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once"
5230,"or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic"
5230,"gusts of violence. He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest"
5230,"intensity. His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily"
5230,"upon him, but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make"
5230,"neither head nor tail of what she heard."
5230,""
5230,"He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out"
5230,"muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he"
5230,"chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and"
5230,"banks. His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the"
5230,"penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the"
5230,"darkness upon one or two home-going labourers, and Teddy Henfrey,"
5230,"tumbling out of the “Scarlet Coat” one night, at half-past nine, was"
5230,"scared shamefully by the stranger’s skull-like head (he was walking hat"
5230,"in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door. Such children"
5230,"as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and it seemed doubtful"
5230,"whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him, or the reverse;"
5230,"but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side."
5230,""
5230,"It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and"
5230,"bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping."
5230,"Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was"
5230,"sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very carefully"
5230,"that he was an “experimental investigator,” going gingerly over the"
5230,"syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked what an experimental"
5230,"investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most"
5230,"educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that"
5230,"he “discovered things.” Her visitor had had an accident, she said,"
5230,"which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a"
5230,"sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact."
5230,""
5230,"Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a"
5230,"criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to"
5230,"conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang"
5230,"from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating"
5230,"from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred."
5230,"Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant"
5230,"in the National School, this theory took the form that the stranger was"
5230,"an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and he resolved to"
5230,"undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These"
5230,"consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger"
5230,"whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger,"
5230,"leading questions about him. But he detected nothing."
5230,""
5230,"Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either accepted"
5230,"the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for instance, Silas"
5230,"Durgan, who was heard to assert that “if he chooses to show enself at"
5230,"fairs he’d make his fortune in no time,” and being a bit of a"
5230,"theologian, compared the stranger to the man with the one talent. Yet"
5230,"another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a"
5230,"harmless lunatic. That had the advantage of accounting for everything"
5230,"straight away."
5230,""
5230,"Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers. Sussex"
5230,"folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early"
5230,"April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the"
5230,"village. Even then it was only credited among the women folk."
5230,""
5230,"But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole, agreed"
5230,"in disliking him. His irritability, though it might have been"
5230,"comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing to these"
5230,"quiet Sussex villagers. The frantic gesticulations they surprised now"
5230,"and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them"
5230,"round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances"
5230,"of curiosity, the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors,"
5230,"the pulling down of blinds, the extinction of candles and lamps—who"
5230,"could agree with such goings on? They drew aside as he passed down the"
5230,"village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with"
5230,"coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him"
5230,"in imitation of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that"
5230,"time called “The Bogey Man”. Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom"
5230,"concert (in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or"
5230,"two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared,"
5230,"a bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in"
5230,"the midst of them. Also belated little children would call “Bogey Man!”"
5230,"after him, and make off tremulously elated."
5230,""
5230,"Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The bandages"
5230,"excited his professional interest, the report of the thousand and one"
5230,"bottles aroused his jealous regard. All through April and May he"
5230,"coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger, and at last, towards"
5230,"Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but hit upon the"
5230,"subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He was surprised to"
5230,"find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest’s name. “He give a name,”"
5230,"said Mrs. Hall—an assertion which was quite unfounded—“but I didn’t"
5230,"rightly hear it.” She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man’s"
5230,"name."
5230,""
5230,"Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly audible"
5230,"imprecation from within. “Pardon my intrusion,” said Cuss, and then the"
5230,"door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation."
5230,""
5230,"She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then a"
5230,"cry of surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark of"
5230,"laughter, quick steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face white,"
5230,"his eyes staring over his shoulder. He left the door open behind him,"
5230,"and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the"
5230,"steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the road. He carried his"
5230,"hat in his hand. She stood behind the door, looking at the open door of"
5230,"the parlour. Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly, and then his"
5230,"footsteps came across the room. She could not see his face where she"
5230,"stood. The parlour door slammed, and the place was silent again."
5230,""
5230,"Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. “Am I mad?”"
5230,"Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. “Do I look"
5230,"like an insane person?”"
5230,""
5230,"“What’s happened?” said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the loose"
5230,"sheets of his forth-coming sermon."
5230,""
5230,"“That chap at the inn—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Give me something to drink,” said Cuss, and he sat down."
5230,""
5230,"When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry—the only"
5230,"drink the good vicar had available—he told him of the interview he had"
5230,"just had. “Went in,” he gasped, “and began to demand a subscription for"
5230,"that Nurse Fund. He’d stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in, and"
5230,"he sat down lumpily in his chair. Sniffed. I told him I’d heard he took"
5230,"an interest in scientific things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on"
5230,"sniffing all the time; evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No"
5230,"wonder, wrapped up like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the"
5230,"while kept my eyes open. Bottles—chemicals—everywhere. Balance,"
5230,"test-tubes in stands, and a smell of—evening primrose. Would he"
5230,"subscribe? Said he’d consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he"
5230,"researching. Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. ‘A damnable"
5230,"long research,’ said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. ‘Oh,’ said"
5230,"I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the boil, and my"
5230,"question boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most"
5230,"valuable prescription—what for he wouldn’t say. Was it medical? ‘Damn"
5230,"you! What are you fishing after?’ I apologised. Dignified sniff and"
5230,"cough. He resumed. He’d read it. Five ingredients. Put it down; turned"
5230,"his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper. Swish, rustle."
5230,"He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said. Saw a"
5230,"flicker, and there was the prescription burning and lifting"
5230,"chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney. So!"
5230,"Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came his arm.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well?”"
5230,""
5230,"“No hand—just an empty sleeve. Lord! I thought, _that’s_ a deformity!"
5230,"Got a cork arm, I suppose, and has taken it off. Then, I thought,"
5230,"there’s something odd in that. What the devil keeps that sleeve up and"
5230,"open, if there’s nothing in it? There was nothing in it, I tell you."
5230,"Nothing down it, right down to the joint. I could see right down it to"
5230,"the elbow, and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of"
5230,"the cloth. ‘Good God!’ I said. Then he stopped. Stared at me with those"
5230,"black goggles of his, and then at his sleeve.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well?”"
5230,""
5230,"“That’s all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve back"
5230,"in his pocket quickly. ‘I was saying,’ said he, ‘that there was the"
5230,"prescription burning, wasn’t I?’ Interrogative cough. ‘How the devil,’"
5230,"said I, ‘can you move an empty sleeve like that?’ ‘Empty sleeve?’"
5230,"‘Yes,’ said I, ‘an empty sleeve.’"
5230,""
5230,"“‘It’s an empty sleeve, is it? You saw it was an empty sleeve?’ He"
5230,"stood up right away. I stood up too. He came towards me in three very"
5230,"slow steps, and stood quite close. Sniffed venomously. I didn’t flinch,"
5230,"though I’m hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and those blinkers,"
5230,"aren’t enough to unnerve any one, coming quietly up to you."
5230,""
5230,"“‘You said it was an empty sleeve?’ he said. ‘Certainly,’ I said. At"
5230,"staring and saying nothing a barefaced man, unspectacled, starts"
5230,"scratch. Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket"
5230,"again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me"
5230,"again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age."
5230,"‘Well?’ said I, clearing my throat, ‘there’s nothing in it.’"
5230,""
5230,"“Had to say something. I was beginning to feel frightened. I could see"
5230,"right down it. He extended it straight towards me, slowly, slowly—just"
5230,"like that—until the cuff was six inches from my face. Queer thing to"
5230,"see an empty sleeve come at you like that! And then—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Something—exactly like a finger and thumb it felt—nipped my nose.”"
5230,""
5230,"Bunting began to laugh."
5230,""
5230,"“There wasn’t anything there!” said Cuss, his voice running up into a"
5230,"shriek at the “there.” “It’s all very well for you to laugh, but I tell"
5230,"you I was so startled, I hit his cuff hard, and turned around, and cut"
5230,"out of the room—I left him—”"
5230,""
5230,"Cuss stopped. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic. He"
5230,"turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent"
5230,"vicar’s very inferior sherry. “When I hit his cuff,” said Cuss, “I tell"
5230,"you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm. And there wasn’t an arm!"
5230,"There wasn’t the ghost of an arm!”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Bunting thought it over. He looked suspiciously at Cuss. “It’s a"
5230,"most remarkable story,” he said. He looked very wise and grave indeed."
5230,"“It’s really,” said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis, “a most"
5230,"remarkable story.”"

5230,"CHAPTER V."
5230,"THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through"
5230,"the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of"
5230,"Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities. Mrs."
5230,"Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before"
5230,"the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had"
5230,"opened and closed. She did not arouse her husband at first, but sat up"
5230,"in bed listening. She then distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare"
5230,"feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the"
5230,"passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she"
5230,"aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike"
5230,"a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath"
5230,"slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite"
5230,"distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then"
5230,"a violent sneeze."
5230,""
5230,"At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most obvious"
5230,"weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as noiselessly as"
5230,"possible. Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing."
5230,""
5230,"The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was"
5230,"past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study"
5230,"doorway yawned impenetrably black. Everything was still except the"
5230,"faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting’s tread, and the slight"
5230,"movements in the study. Then something snapped, the drawer was opened,"
5230,"and there was a rustle of papers. Then came an imprecation, and a match"
5230,"was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light. Mr. Bunting was"
5230,"now in the hall, and through the crack of the door he could see the"
5230,"desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk. But the"
5230,"robber he could not see. He stood there in the hall undecided what to"
5230,"do, and Mrs. Bunting, her face white and intent, crept slowly"
5230,"downstairs after him. One thing kept Mr. Bunting’s courage; the"
5230,"persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village."
5230,""
5230,"They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had found"
5230,"the housekeeping reserve of gold—two pounds ten in half sovereigns"
5230,"altogether. At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action."
5230,"Gripping the poker firmly, he rushed into the room, closely followed by"
5230,"Mrs. Bunting. “Surrender!” cried Mr. Bunting, fiercely, and then"
5230,"stooped amazed. Apparently the room was perfectly empty."
5230,""
5230,"Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody"
5230,"moving in the room had amounted to a certainty. For half a minute,"
5230,"perhaps, they stood gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and"
5230,"looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred impulse,"
5230,"peered under the desk. Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the"
5230,"window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it"
5230,"with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket"
5230,"and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came to a"
5230,"stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other."
5230,""
5230,"“I could have sworn—” said Mr. Bunting."
5230,""
5230,"“The candle!” said Mr. Bunting. “Who lit the candle?”"
5230,""
5230,"“The drawer!” said Mrs. Bunting. “And the money’s gone!”"
5230,""
5230,"She went hastily to the doorway."
5230,""
5230,"“Of all the strange occurrences—”"
5230,""
5230,"There was a violent sneeze in the passage. They rushed out, and as they"
5230,"did so the kitchen door slammed. “Bring the candle,” said Mr. Bunting,"
5230,"and led the way. They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot"
5230,"back."
5230,""
5230,"As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back"
5230,"door was just opening, and the faint light of early dawn displayed the"
5230,"dark masses of the garden beyond. He is certain that nothing went out"
5230,"of the door. It opened, stood open for a moment, and then closed with a"
5230,"slam. As it did so, the candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study"
5230,"flickered and flared. It was a minute or more before they entered the"
5230,"kitchen."
5230,""
5230,"The place was empty. They refastened the back door, examined the"
5230,"kitchen, pantry, and scullery thoroughly, and at last went down into"
5230,"the cellar. There was not a soul to be found in the house, search as"
5230,"they would."
5230,""
5230,"Daylight found the vicar and his wife, a quaintly-costumed little"
5230,"couple, still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the"
5230,"unnecessary light of a guttering candle."

5230,"CHAPTER VI."
5230,"THE FURNITURE THAT WENT MAD"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday, before Millie"
5230,"was hunted out for the day, Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went"
5230,"noiselessly down into the cellar. Their business there was of a private"
5230,"nature, and had something to do with the specific gravity of their"
5230,"beer. They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had"
5230,"forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room."
5230,"As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair, Hall very"
5230,"properly went upstairs for it."
5230,""
5230,"On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger’s door was"
5230,"ajar. He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been"
5230,"directed."
5230,""
5230,"But returning with the bottle, he noticed that the bolts of the front"
5230,"door had been shot back, that the door was in fact simply on the latch."
5230,"And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger’s"
5230,"room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. He distinctly"
5230,"remembered holding the candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts"
5230,"overnight. At the sight he stopped, gaping, then with the bottle still"
5230,"in his hand went upstairs again. He rapped at the stranger’s door."
5230,"There was no answer. He rapped again; then pushed the door wide open"
5230,"and entered."
5230,""
5230,"It was as he expected. The bed, the room also, was empty. And what was"
5230,"stranger, even to his heavy intelligence, on the bedroom chair and"
5230,"along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments, the only"
5230,"garments so far as he knew, and the bandages of their guest. His big"
5230,"slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post."
5230,""
5230,"As Hall stood there he heard his wife’s voice coming out of the depth"
5230,"of the cellar, with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and"
5230,"interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note, by which"
5230,"the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience."
5230,"“George! You gart whad a wand?”"
5230,""
5230,"At that he turned and hurried down to her. “Janny,” he said, over the"
5230,"rail of the cellar steps, “’tas the truth what Henfrey sez. ’E’s not in"
5230,"uz room, ’e en’t. And the front door’s onbolted.”"
5230,""
5230,"At first Mrs. Hall did not understand, and as soon as she did she"
5230,"resolved to see the empty room for herself. Hall, still holding the"
5230,"bottle, went first. “If ’e en’t there,” he said, “’is close are. And"
5230,"what’s ’e doin’ ’ithout ’is close, then? ’Tas a most curious business.”"
5230,""
5230,"As they came up the cellar steps they both, it was afterwards"
5230,"ascertained, fancied they heard the front door open and shut, but"
5230,"seeing it closed and nothing there, neither said a word to the other"
5230,"about it at the time. Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and"
5230,"ran on first upstairs. Someone sneezed on the staircase. Hall,"
5230,"following six steps behind, thought that he heard her sneeze. She,"
5230,"going on first, was under the impression that Hall was sneezing. She"
5230,"flung open the door and stood regarding the room. “Of all the curious!”"
5230,"she said."
5230,""
5230,"She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning, was"
5230,"surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair. But in"
5230,"another moment he was beside her. She bent forward and put her hand on"
5230,"the pillow and then under the clothes."
5230,""
5230,"“Cold,” she said. “He’s been up this hour or more.”"
5230,""
5230,"As she did so, a most extraordinary thing happened. The bed-clothes"
5230,"gathered themselves together, leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak,"
5230,"and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail. It was exactly as if a"
5230,"hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside. Immediately"
5230,"after, the stranger’s hat hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling"
5230,"flight in the air through the better part of a circle, and then dashed"
5230,"straight at Mrs. Hall’s face. Then as swiftly came the sponge from the"
5230,"washstand; and then the chair, flinging the stranger’s coat and"
5230,"trousers carelessly aside, and laughing drily in a voice singularly"
5230,"like the stranger’s, turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall,"
5230,"seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged at her. She"
5230,"screamed and turned, and then the chair legs came gently but firmly"
5230,"against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room. The door"
5230,"slammed violently and was locked. The chair and bed seemed to be"
5230,"executing a dance of triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything"
5230,"was still."
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall’s arms on"
5230,"the landing. It was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. Hall and"
5230,"Millie, who had been roused by her scream of alarm, succeeded in"
5230,"getting her downstairs, and applying the restoratives customary in such"
5230,"cases."
5230,""
5230,"“’Tas sperits,” said Mrs. Hall. “I know ’tas sperits. I’ve read in"
5230,"papers of en. Tables and chairs leaping and dancing...”"
5230,""
5230,"“Take a drop more, Janny,” said Hall. “’Twill steady ye.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Lock him out,” said Mrs. Hall. “Don’t let him come in again. I half"
5230,"guessed—I might ha’ known. With them goggling eyes and bandaged head,"
5230,"and never going to church of a Sunday. And all they bottles—more’n it’s"
5230,"right for any one to have. He’s put the sperits into the furniture...."
5230,"My good old furniture! ’Twas in that very chair my poor dear mother"
5230,"used to sit when I was a little girl. To think it should rise up"
5230,"against me now!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Just a drop more, Janny,” said Hall. “Your nerves is all upset.”"
5230,""
5230,"They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o’clock"
5230,"sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith. Mr. Hall’s"
5230,"compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary."
5230,"Would Mr. Wadgers come round? He was a knowing man, was Mr. Wadgers,"
5230,"and very resourceful. He took quite a grave view of the case. “Arm"
5230,"darmed if thet ent witchcraft,” was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers. “You"
5230,"warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he.”"
5230,""
5230,"He came round greatly concerned. They wanted him to lead the way"
5230,"upstairs to the room, but he didn’t seem to be in any hurry. He"
5230,"preferred to talk in the passage. Over the way Huxter’s apprentice came"
5230,"out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window. He was"
5230,"called over to join the discussion. Mr. Huxter naturally followed over"
5230,"in the course of a few minutes. The Anglo-Saxon genius for"
5230,"parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of"
5230,"talk and no decisive action. “Let’s have the facts first,” insisted Mr."
5230,"Sandy Wadgers. “Let’s be sure we’d be acting perfectly right in bustin’"
5230,"that there door open. A door onbust is always open to bustin’, but ye"
5230,"can’t onbust a door once you’ve busted en.”"
5230,""
5230,"And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened"
5230,"of its own accord, and as they looked up in amazement, they saw"
5230,"descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more"
5230,"blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass"
5230,"eyes of his. He came down stiffly and slowly, staring all the time; he"
5230,"walked across the passage staring, then stopped."
5230,""
5230,"“Look there!” he said, and their eyes followed the direction of his"
5230,"gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door."
5230,"Then he entered the parlour, and suddenly, swiftly, viciously, slammed"
5230,"the door in their faces."
5230,""
5230,"Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away."
5230,"They stared at one another. “Well, if that don’t lick everything!” said"
5230,"Mr. Wadgers, and left the alternative unsaid."
5230,""
5230,"“I’d go in and ask’n ’bout it,” said Wadgers, to Mr. Hall. “I’d d’mand"
5230,"an explanation.”"
5230,""
5230,"It took some time to bring the landlady’s husband up to that pitch. At"
5230,"last he rapped, opened the door, and got as far as, “Excuse me—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Go to the devil!” said the stranger in a tremendous voice, and “Shut"
5230,"that door after you.” So that brief interview terminated."

5230,"CHAPTER VII."
5230,"THE UNVEILING OF THE STRANGER"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"The stranger went into the little parlour of the “Coach and Horses”"
5230,"about half-past five in the morning, and there he remained until near"
5230,"midday, the blinds down, the door shut, and none, after Hall’s repulse,"
5230,"venturing near him."
5230,""
5230,"All that time he must have fasted. Thrice he rang his bell, the third"
5230,"time furiously and continuously, but no one answered him. “Him and his"
5230,"‘go to the devil’ indeed!” said Mrs. Hall. Presently came an imperfect"
5230,"rumour of the burglary at the vicarage, and two and two were put"
5230,"together. Hall, assisted by Wadgers, went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth,"
5230,"the magistrate, and take his advice. No one ventured upstairs. How the"
5230,"stranger occupied himself is unknown. Now and then he would stride"
5230,"violently up and down, and twice came an outburst of curses, a tearing"
5230,"of paper, and a violent smashing of bottles."
5230,""
5230,"The little group of scared but curious people increased. Mrs. Huxter"
5230,"came over; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made"
5230,"jackets and _piqué_ paper ties—for it was Whit Monday—joined the group"
5230,"with confused interrogations. Young Archie Harker distinguished himself"
5230,"by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds. He"
5230,"could see nothing, but gave reason for supposing that he did, and"
5230,"others of the Iping youth presently joined him."
5230,""
5230,"It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays, and down the village"
5230,"street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths, a shooting gallery, and on"
5230,"the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some"
5230,"picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy. The"
5230,"gentlemen wore blue jerseys, the ladies white aprons and quite"
5230,"fashionable hats with heavy plumes. Wodger, of the “Purple Fawn,” and"
5230,"Mr. Jaggers, the cobbler, who also sold old second-hand ordinary"
5230,"bicycles, were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns"
5230,"(which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee) across"
5230,"the road."
5230,""
5230,"And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which only"
5230,"one thin jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we must"
5230,"suppose, and fearful, hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings, pored"
5230,"through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little"
5230,"bottles, and occasionally swore savagely at the boys, audible if"
5230,"invisible, outside the windows. In the corner by the fireplace lay the"
5230,"fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles, and a pungent twang of"
5230,"chlorine tainted the air. So much we know from what was heard at the"
5230,"time and from what was subsequently seen in the room."
5230,""
5230,"About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring"
5230,"fixedly at the three or four people in the bar. “Mrs. Hall,” he said."
5230,"Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval, a little short of breath, but all"
5230,"the fiercer for that. Hall was still out. She had deliberated over this"
5230,"scene, and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon"
5230,"it. “Is it your bill you’re wanting, sir?” she said."
5230,""
5230,"“Why wasn’t my breakfast laid? Why haven’t you prepared my meals and"
5230,"answered my bell? Do you think I live without eating?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Why isn’t my bill paid?” said Mrs. Hall. “That’s what I want to know.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance—”"
5230,""
5230,"“I told you two days ago I wasn’t going to await no remittances. You"
5230,"can’t grumble if your breakfast waits a bit, if my bill’s been waiting"
5230,"these five days, can you?”"
5230,""
5230,"The stranger swore briefly but vividly."
5230,""
5230,"“Nar, nar!” from the bar."
5230,""
5230,"“And I’d thank you kindly, sir, if you’d keep your swearing to"
5230,"yourself, sir,” said Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever."
5230,"It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of"
5230,"him. His next words showed as much."
5230,""
5230,"“Look here, my good woman—” he began."
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t ‘good woman’ _me_,” said Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ve told you my remittance hasn’t come.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Remittance indeed!” said Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“Still, I daresay in my pocket—”"
5230,""
5230,"“You told me three days ago that you hadn’t anything but a sovereign’s"
5230,"worth of silver upon you.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well, I’ve found some more—”"
5230,""
5230,"“’Ul-lo!” from the bar."
5230,""
5230,"“I wonder where you found it,” said Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"That seemed to annoy the stranger very much. He stamped his foot. “What"
5230,"do you mean?” he said."
5230,""
5230,"“That I wonder where you found it,” said Mrs. Hall. “And before I take"
5230,"any bills or get any breakfasts, or do any such things whatsoever, you"
5230,"got to tell me one or two things I don’t understand, and what nobody"
5230,"don’t understand, and what everybody is very anxious to understand. I"
5230,"want to know what you been doing t’my chair upstairs, and I want to"
5230,"know how ’tis your room was empty, and how you got in again. Them as"
5230,"stops in this house comes in by the doors—that’s the rule of the house,"
5230,"and that you _didn’t_ do, and what I want to know is how you _did_ come"
5230,"in. And I want to know—”"
5230,""
5230,"Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched, stamped his"
5230,"foot, and said, “Stop!” with such extraordinary violence that he"
5230,"silenced her instantly."
5230,""
5230,"“You don’t understand,” he said, “who I am or what I am. I’ll show you."
5230,"By Heaven! I’ll show you.” Then he put his open palm over his face and"
5230,"withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black cavity. “Here,” he"
5230,"said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she,"
5230,"staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically. Then, when"
5230,"she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered"
5230,"back. The nose—it was the stranger’s nose! pink and shining—rolled on"
5230,"the floor."
5230,""
5230,"Then he removed his spectacles, and everyone in the bar gasped. He took"
5230,"off his hat, and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and"
5230,"bandages. For a moment they resisted him. A flash of horrible"
5230,"anticipation passed through the bar. “Oh, my Gard!” said some one. Then"
5230,"off they came."
5230,""
5230,"It was worse than anything. Mrs. Hall, standing open-mouthed and"
5230,"horror-struck, shrieked at what she saw, and made for the door of the"
5230,"house. Everyone began to move. They were prepared for scars,"
5230,"disfigurements, tangible horrors, but nothing! The bandages and false"
5230,"hair flew across the passage into the bar, making a hobbledehoy jump to"
5230,"avoid them. Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps. For the"
5230,"man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation, was a solid"
5230,"gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him, and"
5230,"then—nothingness, no visible thing at all!"
5230,""
5230,"People down the village heard shouts and shrieks, and looking up the"
5230,"street saw the “Coach and Horses” violently firing out its humanity."
5230,"They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid"
5230,"tumbling over her, and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie,"
5230,"who, emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult, had"
5230,"come upon the headless stranger from behind. These increased suddenly."
5230,""
5230,"Forthwith everyone all down the street, the sweetstuff seller, cocoanut"
5230,"shy proprietor and his assistant, the swing man, little boys and girls,"
5230,"rustic dandies, smart wenches, smocked elders and aproned gipsies—began"
5230,"running towards the inn, and in a miraculously short space of time a"
5230,"crowd of perhaps forty people, and rapidly increasing, swayed and"
5230,"hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested, in front of Mrs."
5230,"Hall’s establishment. Everyone seemed eager to talk at once, and the"
5230,"result was Babel. A small group supported Mrs. Hall, who was picked up"
5230,"in a state of collapse. There was a conference, and the incredible"
5230,"evidence of a vociferous eye-witness. “O Bogey!” “What’s he been doin’,"
5230,"then?” “Ain’t hurt the girl, ’as ’e?” “Run at en with a knife, I"
5230,"believe.” “No ’ed, I tell ye. I don’t mean no manner of speaking. I"
5230,"mean _marn ’ithout a ’ed_!” “Narnsense! ’tis some conjuring trick.”"
5230,"“Fetched off ’is wrapping, ’e did—”"
5230,""
5230,"In its struggles to see in through the open door, the crowd formed"
5230,"itself into a straggling wedge, with the more adventurous apex nearest"
5230,"the inn. “He stood for a moment, I heerd the gal scream, and he turned."
5230,"I saw her skirts whisk, and he went after her. Didn’t take ten seconds."
5230,"Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf; stood just as if he"
5230,"was staring. Not a moment ago. Went in that there door. I tell ’e, ’e"
5230,"ain’t gart no ’ed at all. You just missed en—”"
5230,""
5230,"There was a disturbance behind, and the speaker stopped to step aside"
5230,"for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the"
5230,"house; first Mr. Hall, very red and determined, then Mr. Bobby Jaffers,"
5230,"the village constable, and then the wary Mr. Wadgers. They had come now"
5230,"armed with a warrant."
5230,""
5230,"People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances."
5230,"“’Ed or no ’ed,” said Jaffers, “I got to ’rest en, and ’rest en I"
5230,"_will_.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Hall marched up the steps, marched straight to the door of the"
5230,"parlour and flung it open. “Constable,” he said, “do your duty.”"
5230,""
5230,"Jaffers marched in. Hall next, Wadgers last. They saw in the dim light"
5230,"the headless figure facing them, with a gnawed crust of bread in one"
5230,"gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other."
5230,""
5230,"“That’s him!” said Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“What the devil’s this?” came in a tone of angry expostulation from"
5230,"above the collar of the figure."
5230,""
5230,"“You’re a damned rum customer, mister,” said Mr. Jaffers. “But ’ed or"
5230,"no ’ed, the warrant says ‘body,’ and duty’s duty—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Keep off!” said the figure, starting back."
5230,""
5230,"Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese, and Mr. Hall just"
5230,"grasped the knife on the table in time to save it. Off came the"
5230,"stranger’s left glove and was slapped in Jaffers’ face. In another"
5230,"moment Jaffers, cutting short some statement concerning a warrant, had"
5230,"gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat. He"
5230,"got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout, but he kept his"
5230,"grip. Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers, who acted"
5230,"as goal-keeper for the offensive, so to speak, and then stepped forward"
5230,"as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him, clutching"
5230,"and hitting in. A chair stood in the way, and went aside with a crash"
5230,"as they came down together."
5230,""
5230,"“Get the feet,” said Jaffers between his teeth."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Hall, endeavouring to act on instructions, received a sounding kick"
5230,"in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment, and Mr. Wadgers, seeing"
5230,"the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of"
5230,"Jaffers, retreated towards the door, knife in hand, and so collided"
5230,"with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law"
5230,"and order. At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the"
5230,"chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll surrender,” cried the stranger, though he had Jaffers down, and"
5230,"in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and"
5230,"handless—for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left."
5230,"“It’s no good,” he said, as if sobbing for breath."
5230,""
5230,"It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if"
5230,"out of empty space, but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most"
5230,"matter-of-fact people under the sun. Jaffers got up also and produced a"
5230,"pair of handcuffs. Then he stared."
5230,""
5230,"“I say!” said Jaffers, brought up short by a dim realization of the"
5230,"incongruity of the whole business, “Darn it! Can’t use ’em as I can"
5230,"see.”"
5230,""
5230,"The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat, and as if by a miracle the"
5230,"buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone. Then he said"
5230,"something about his shin, and stooped down. He seemed to be fumbling"
5230,"with his shoes and socks."
5230,""
5230,"“Why!” said Huxter, suddenly, “that’s not a man at all. It’s just empty"
5230,"clothes. Look! You can see down his collar and the linings of his"
5230,"clothes. I could put my arm—”"
5230,""
5230,"He extended his hand; it seemed to meet something in mid-air, and he"
5230,"drew it back with a sharp exclamation. “I wish you’d keep your fingers"
5230,"out of my eye,” said the aerial voice, in a tone of savage"
5230,"expostulation. “The fact is, I’m all here—head, hands, legs, and all"
5230,"the rest of it, but it happens I’m invisible. It’s a confounded"
5230,"nuisance, but I am. That’s no reason why I should be poked to pieces by"
5230,"every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?”"
5230,""
5230,"The suit of clothes, now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its"
5230,"unseen supports, stood up, arms akimbo."
5230,""
5230,"Several other of the men folks had now entered the room, so that it was"
5230,"closely crowded. “Invisible, eh?” said Huxter, ignoring the stranger’s"
5230,"abuse. “Who ever heard the likes of that?”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s strange, perhaps, but it’s not a crime. Why am I assaulted by a"
5230,"policeman in this fashion?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Ah! that’s a different matter,” said Jaffers. “No doubt you are a bit"
5230,"difficult to see in this light, but I got a warrant and it’s all"
5230,"correct. What I’m after ain’t no invisibility,—it’s burglary. There’s a"
5230,"house been broke into and money took.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well?”"
5230,""
5230,"“And circumstances certainly point—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Stuff and nonsense!” said the Invisible Man."
5230,""
5230,"“I hope so, sir; but I’ve got my instructions.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well,” said the stranger, “I’ll come. I’ll _come_. But no handcuffs.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s the regular thing,” said Jaffers."
5230,""
5230,"“No handcuffs,” stipulated the stranger."
5230,""
5230,"“Pardon me,” said Jaffers."
5230,""
5230,"Abruptly the figure sat down, and before any one could realise was was"
5230,"being done, the slippers, socks, and trousers had been kicked off under"
5230,"the table. Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat."
5230,""
5230,"“Here, stop that,” said Jaffers, suddenly realising what was happening."
5230,"He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt slipped out of"
5230,"it and left it limp and empty in his hand. “Hold him!” said Jaffers,"
5230,"loudly. “Once he gets the things off—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Hold him!” cried everyone, and there was a rush at the fluttering"
5230,"white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger."
5230,""
5230,"The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall’s face that stopped his"
5230,"open-armed advance, and sent him backward into old Toothsome the"
5230,"sexton, and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became"
5230,"convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms, even as a shirt that is"
5230,"being thrust over a man’s head. Jaffers clutched at it, and only helped"
5230,"to pull it off; he was struck in the mouth out of the air, and"
5230,"incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon"
5230,"the crown of his head."
5230,""
5230,"“Look out!” said everybody, fencing at random and hitting at nothing."
5230,"“Hold him! Shut the door! Don’t let him loose! I got something! Here he"
5230,"is!” A perfect Babel of noises they made. Everybody, it seemed, was"
5230,"being hit all at once, and Sandy Wadgers, knowing as ever and his wits"
5230,"sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose, reopened the door and led"
5230,"the rout. The others, following incontinently, were jammed for a moment"
5230,"in the corner by the doorway. The hitting continued. Phipps, the"
5230,"Unitarian, had a front tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the"
5230,"cartilage of his ear. Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning,"
5230,"caught at something that intervened between him and Huxter in the"
5230,"mêlée, and prevented their coming together. He felt a muscular chest,"
5230,"and in another moment the whole mass of struggling, excited men shot"
5230,"out into the crowded hall."
5230,""
5230,"“I got him!” shouted Jaffers, choking and reeling through them all, and"
5230,"wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy."
5230,""
5230,"Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed"
5230,"swiftly towards the house door, and went spinning down the half-dozen"
5230,"steps of the inn. Jaffers cried in a strangled voice—holding tight,"
5230,"nevertheless, and making play with his knee—spun around, and fell"
5230,"heavily undermost with his head on the gravel. Only then did his"
5230,"fingers relax."
5230,""
5230,"There were excited cries of “Hold him!” “Invisible!” and so forth, and"
5230,"a young fellow, a stranger in the place whose name did not come to"
5230,"light, rushed in at once, caught something, missed his hold, and fell"
5230,"over the constable’s prostrate body. Half-way across the road a woman"
5230,"screamed as something pushed by her; a dog, kicked apparently, yelped"
5230,"and ran howling into Huxter’s yard, and with that the transit of the"
5230,"Invisible Man was accomplished. For a space people stood amazed and"
5230,"gesticulating, and then came panic, and scattered them abroad through"
5230,"the village as a gust scatters dead leaves."
5230,""
5230,"But Jaffers lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot of"
5230,"the steps of the inn."

5230,"CHAPTER VIII."
5230,"IN TRANSIT"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbons, the"
5230,"amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the spacious"
5230,"open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him, as he"
5230,"thought, and almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as of a man"
5230,"coughing, sneezing, and then swearing savagely to himself; and looking,"
5230,"beheld nothing. Yet the voice was indisputable. It continued to swear"
5230,"with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a"
5230,"cultivated man. It grew to a climax, diminished again, and died away in"
5230,"the distance, going as it seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean."
5230,"It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended. Gibbons had heard nothing of"
5230,"the morning’s occurrences, but the phenomenon was so striking and"
5230,"disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up"
5230,"hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the"
5230,"village, as fast as he could go."

5230,""
5230,"CHAPTER IX."
5230,"MR. THOMAS MARVEL"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible"
5230,"visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample,"
5230,"fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity. His figure"
5230,"inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination."
5230,"He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and"
5230,"shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume,"
5230,"marked a man essentially bachelor."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside"
5230,"over the down towards Adderdean, about a mile and a half out of Iping."
5230,"His feet, save for socks of irregular open-work, were bare, his big"
5230,"toes were broad, and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog. In a"
5230,"leisurely manner—he did everything in a leisurely manner—he was"
5230,"contemplating trying on a pair of boots. They were the soundest boots"
5230,"he had come across for a long time, but too large for him; whereas the"
5230,"ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable fit, but too"
5230,"thin-soled for damp. Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes, but then he"
5230,"hated damp. He had never properly thought out which he hated most, and"
5230,"it was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better to do. So he put"
5230,"the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them. And"
5230,"seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly"
5230,"occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see. He was"
5230,"not at all startled by a voice behind him."
5230,""
5230,"“They’re boots, anyhow,” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“They are—charity boots,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with his head on one"
5230,"side regarding them distastefully; “and which is the ugliest pair in"
5230,"the whole blessed universe, I’m darned if I know!”"
5230,""
5230,"“H’m,” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ve worn worse—in fact, I’ve worn none. But none so owdacious ugly—if"
5230,"you’ll allow the expression. I’ve been cadging boots—in particular—for"
5230,"days. Because I was sick of _them_. They’re sound enough, of course."
5230,"But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots. And"
5230,"if you’ll believe me, I’ve raised nothing in the whole blessed country,"
5230,"try as I would, but _them_. Look at ’em! And a good country for boots,"
5230,"too, in a general way. But it’s just my promiscuous luck. I’ve got my"
5230,"boots in this country ten years or more. And then they treat you like"
5230,"this.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s a beast of a country,” said the Voice. “And pigs for people.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Ain’t it?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel. “Lord! But them boots! It beats"
5230,"it.”"
5230,""
5230,"He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the boots"
5230,"of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo! where the boots"
5230,"of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots. He"
5230,"was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement. “Where _are_ yer?”"
5230,"said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours. He"
5230,"saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote"
5230,"green-pointed furze bushes."
5230,""
5230,"“Am I drunk?” said Mr. Marvel. “Have I had visions? Was I talking to"
5230,"myself? What the—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t be alarmed,” said a Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“None of your ventriloquising _me_,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rising"
5230,"sharply to his feet. “Where _are_ yer? Alarmed, indeed!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t be alarmed,” repeated the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“_You’ll_ be alarmed in a minute, you silly fool,” said Mr. Thomas"
5230,"Marvel. “Where _are_ yer? Lemme get my mark on yer..."
5230,""
5230,"“Are yer _buried_?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, after an interval."
5230,""
5230,"There was no answer. Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed, his"
5230,"jacket nearly thrown off."
5230,""
5230,"“Peewit,” said a peewit, very remote."
5230,""
5230,"“Peewit, indeed!” said Mr. Thomas Marvel. “This ain’t no time for"
5230,"foolery.” The down was desolate, east and west, north and south; the"
5230,"road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes, ran smooth"
5230,"and empty north and south, and, save for that peewit, the blue sky was"
5230,"empty too. “So help me,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, shuffling his coat on"
5230,"to his shoulders again. “It’s the drink! I might ha’ known.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s not the drink,” said the Voice. “You keep your nerves steady.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Ow!” said Mr. Marvel, and his face grew white amidst its patches."
5230,"“It’s the drink!” his lips repeated noiselessly. He remained staring"
5230,"about him, rotating slowly backwards. “I could have _swore_ I heard a"
5230,"voice,” he whispered."
5230,""
5230,"“Of course you did.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s there again,” said Mr. Marvel, closing his eyes and clasping his"
5230,"hand on his brow with a tragic gesture. He was suddenly taken by the"
5230,"collar and shaken violently, and left more dazed than ever. “Don’t be a"
5230,"fool,” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m—off—my—blooming—chump,” said Mr. Marvel. “It’s no good. It’s"
5230,"fretting about them blarsted boots. I’m off my blessed blooming chump."
5230,"Or it’s spirits.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Neither one thing nor the other,” said the Voice. “Listen!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Chump,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“One minute,” said the Voice, penetratingly, tremulous with"
5230,"self-control."
5230,""
5230,"“Well?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with a strange feeling of having been"
5230,"dug in the chest by a finger."
5230,""
5230,"“You think I’m just imagination? Just imagination?”"
5230,""
5230,"“What else _can_ you be?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of"
5230,"his neck."
5230,""
5230,"“Very well,” said the Voice, in a tone of relief. “Then I’m going to"
5230,"throw flints at you till you think differently.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But where _are_ yer?”"
5230,""
5230,"The Voice made no answer. Whizz came a flint, apparently out of the"
5230,"air, and missed Mr. Marvel’s shoulder by a hair’s-breadth. Mr. Marvel,"
5230,"turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a complicated path,"
5230,"hang for a moment, and then fling at his feet with almost invisible"
5230,"rapidity. He was too amazed to dodge. Whizz it came, and ricochetted"
5230,"from a bare toe into the ditch. Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and"
5230,"howled aloud. Then he started to run, tripped over an unseen obstacle,"
5230,"and came head over heels into a sitting position."
5230,""
5230,"“_Now_,” said the Voice, as a third stone curved upward and hung in the"
5230,"air above the tramp. “Am I imagination?”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet, and was immediately"
5230,"rolled over again. He lay quiet for a moment. “If you struggle any"
5230,"more,” said the Voice, “I shall throw the flint at your head.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s a fair do,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, taking his"
5230,"wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile. “I don’t"
5230,"understand it. Stones flinging themselves. Stones talking. Put yourself"
5230,"down. Rot away. I’m done.”"
5230,""
5230,"The third flint fell."
5230,""
5230,"“It’s very simple,” said the Voice. “I’m an invisible man.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Tell us something I don’t know,” said Mr. Marvel, gasping with pain."
5230,"“Where you’ve hid—how you do it—I _don’t_ know. I’m beat.”"
5230,""
5230,"“That’s all,” said the Voice. “I’m invisible. That’s what I want you to"
5230,"understand.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Anyone could see that. There is no need for you to be so confounded"
5230,"impatient, mister. _Now_ then. Give us a notion. How are you hid?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’m invisible. That’s the great point. And what I want you to"
5230,"understand is this—”"
5230,""
5230,"“But whereabouts?” interrupted Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“Here! Six yards in front of you.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Oh, _come_! I ain’t blind. You’ll be telling me next you’re just thin"
5230,"air. I’m not one of your ignorant tramps—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes, I am—thin air. You’re looking through me.”"
5230,""
5230,"“What! Ain’t there any stuff to you. _Vox et_—what is it?—jabber. Is it"
5230,"that?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I am just a human being—solid, needing food and drink, needing"
5230,"covering too—But I’m invisible. You see? Invisible. Simple idea."
5230,"Invisible.”"
5230,""
5230,"“What, real like?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes, real.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Let’s have a hand of you,” said Marvel, “if you _are_ real. It won’t"
5230,"be so darn out-of-the-way like, then—_Lord_!” he said, “how you made me"
5230,"jump!—gripping me like that!”"
5230,""
5230,"He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged"
5230,"fingers, and his fingers went timorously up the arm, patted a muscular"
5230,"chest, and explored a bearded face. Marvel’s face was astonishment."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m dashed!” he said. “If this don’t beat cock-fighting! Most"
5230,"remarkable!—And there I can see a rabbit clean through you, ’arf a mile"
5230,"away! Not a bit of you visible—except—”"
5230,""
5230,"He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly. “You ’aven’t been"
5230,"eatin’ bread and cheese?” he asked, holding the invisible arm."
5230,""
5230,"“You’re quite right, and it’s not quite assimilated into the system.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Ah!” said Mr. Marvel. “Sort of ghostly, though.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Of course, all this isn’t half so wonderful as you think.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s quite wonderful enough for _my_ modest wants,” said Mr. Thomas"
5230,"Marvel. “Howjer manage it! How the dooce is it done?”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s too long a story. And besides—”"
5230,""
5230,"“I tell you, the whole business fairly beats me,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“What I want to say at present is this: I need help. I have come to"
5230,"that—I came upon you suddenly. I was wandering, mad with rage, naked,"
5230,"impotent. I could have murdered. And I saw you—”"
5230,""
5230,"“_Lord_!” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“I came up behind you—hesitated—went on—”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel’s expression was eloquent."
5230,""
5230,"“—then stopped. ‘Here,’ I said, ‘is an outcast like myself. This is the"
5230,"man for me.’ So I turned back and came to you—you. And—”"
5230,""
5230,"“_Lord_!” said Mr. Marvel. “But I’m all in a tizzy. May I ask—How is"
5230,"it? And what you may be requiring in the way of help?—Invisible!”"
5230,""
5230,"“I want you to help me get clothes—and shelter—and then, with other"
5230,"things. I’ve left them long enough. If you won’t—well! But you"
5230,"_will—must_.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Look here,” said Mr. Marvel. “I’m too flabbergasted. Don’t knock me"
5230,"about any more. And leave me go. I must get steady a bit. And you’ve"
5230,"pretty near broken my toe. It’s all so unreasonable. Empty downs, empty"
5230,"sky. Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature. And then"
5230,"comes a voice. A voice out of heaven! And stones! And a fist—Lord!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Pull yourself together,” said the Voice, “for you have to do the job"
5230,"I’ve chosen for you.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ve chosen you,” said the Voice. “You are the only man except some of"
5230,"those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as an invisible"
5230,"man. You have to be my helper. Help me—and I will do great things for"
5230,"you. An invisible man is a man of power.” He stopped for a moment to"
5230,"sneeze violently."
5230,""
5230,"“But if you betray me,” he said, “if you fail to do as I direct you—”"
5230,"He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel’s shoulder smartly. Mr. Marvel gave a"
5230,"yelp of terror at the touch. “I don’t want to betray you,” said Mr."
5230,"Marvel, edging away from the direction of the fingers. “Don’t you go"
5230,"a-thinking that, whatever you do. All I want to do is to help you—just"
5230,"tell me what I got to do. (Lord!) Whatever you want done, that I’m most"
5230,"willing to do.”"

5230,"CHAPTER X."
5230,"MR. MARVEL’S VISIT TO IPING"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became"
5230,"argumentative. Scepticism suddenly reared its head—rather nervous"
5230,"scepticism, not at all assured of its back, but scepticism"
5230,"nevertheless. It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man;"
5230,"and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air, or felt the"
5230,"strength of his arm, could be counted on the fingers of two hands. And"
5230,"of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing, having retired"
5230,"impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house, and Jaffers was"
5230,"lying stunned in the parlour of the “Coach and Horses.” Great and"
5230,"strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men"
5230,"and women than smaller, more tangible considerations. Iping was gay"
5230,"with bunting, and everybody was in gala dress. Whit Monday had been"
5230,"looked forward to for a month or more. By the afternoon even those who"
5230,"believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements"
5230,"in a tentative fashion, on the supposition that he had quite gone away,"
5230,"and with the sceptics he was already a jest. But people, sceptics and"
5230,"believers alike, were remarkably sociable all that day."
5230,""
5230,"Haysman’s meadow was gay with a tent, in which Mrs. Bunting and other"
5230,"ladies were preparing tea, while, without, the Sunday-school children"
5230,"ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and"
5230,"the Misses Cuss and Sackbut. No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in"
5230,"the air, but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever"
5230,"imaginative qualms they experienced. On the village green an inclined"
5230,"strong [rope?], down which, clinging the while to a pulley-swung"
5230,"handle, one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end,"
5230,"came in for considerable favour among the adolescents, as also did the"
5230,"swings and the cocoanut shies. There was also promenading, and the"
5230,"steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a"
5230,"pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music. Members of the"
5230,"club, who had attended church in the morning, were splendid in badges"
5230,"of pink and green, and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their"
5230,"bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon. Old Fletcher,"
5230,"whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe, was visible through"
5230,"the jasmine about his window or through the open door (whichever way"
5230,"you chose to look), poised delicately on a plank supported on two"
5230,"chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room."
5230,""
5230,"About four o’clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of"
5230,"the downs. He was a short, stout person in an extraordinarily shabby"
5230,"top hat, and he appeared to be very much out of breath. His cheeks were"
5230,"alternately limp and tightly puffed. His mottled face was apprehensive,"
5230,"and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity. He turned the corner of"
5230,"the church, and directed his way to the “Coach and Horses.” Among"
5230,"others old Fletcher remembers seeing him, and indeed the old gentleman"
5230,"was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a"
5230,"quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat"
5230,"while regarding him."
5230,""
5230,"This stranger, to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut"
5230,"shy, appeared to be talking to himself, and Mr. Huxter remarked the"
5230,"same thing. He stopped at the foot of the “Coach and Horses” steps,"
5230,"and, according to Mr. Huxter, appeared to undergo a severe internal"
5230,"struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house. Finally he"
5230,"marched up the steps, and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left"
5230,"and open the door of the parlour. Mr. Huxter heard voices from within"
5230,"the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error. “That room’s"
5230,"private!” said Hall, and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went"
5230,"into the bar."
5230,""
5230,"In the course of a few minutes he reappeared, wiping his lips with the"
5230,"back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow"
5230,"impressed Mr. Huxter as assumed. He stood looking about him for some"
5230,"moments, and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner"
5230,"towards the gates of the yard, upon which the parlour window opened."
5230,"The stranger, after some hesitation, leant against one of the"
5230,"gate-posts, produced a short clay pipe, and prepared to fill it. His"
5230,"fingers trembled while doing so. He lit it clumsily, and folding his"
5230,"arms began to smoke in a languid attitude, an attitude which his"
5230,"occasional glances up the yard altogether belied."
5230,""
5230,"All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window, and"
5230,"the singularity of the man’s behaviour prompted him to maintain his"
5230,"observation."
5230,""
5230,"Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his"
5230,"pocket. Then he vanished into the yard. Forthwith Mr. Huxter,"
5230,"conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny, leapt round his"
5230,"counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief. As he did so,"
5230,"Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big bundle in a blue"
5230,"table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied together—as it proved"
5230,"afterwards with the Vicar’s braces—in the other. Directly he saw Huxter"
5230,"he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left, began to run."
5230,"“Stop, thief!” cried Huxter, and set off after him. Mr. Huxter’s"
5230,"sensations were vivid but brief. He saw the man just before him and"
5230,"spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road. He saw the"
5230,"village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or so turned towards"
5230,"him. He bawled, “Stop!” again. He had hardly gone ten strides before"
5230,"his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion, and he was no longer"
5230,"running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air. He saw"
5230,"the ground suddenly close to his face. The world seemed to splash into"
5230,"a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceedings"
5230,"interested him no more."

5230,"CHAPTER XI."
5230,"IN THE “COACH AND HORSES”"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn, it is"
5230,"necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view"
5230,"of Mr. Huxter’s window."
5230,""
5230,"At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour."
5230,"They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the"
5230,"morning, and were, with Mr. Hall’s permission, making a thorough"
5230,"examination of the Invisible Man’s belongings. Jaffers had partially"
5230,"recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his"
5230,"sympathetic friends. The stranger’s scattered garments had been removed"
5230,"by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up. And on the table under the window"
5230,"where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had hit almost at once"
5230,"on three big books in manuscript labelled “Diary.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Diary!” said Cuss, putting the three books on the table. “Now, at any"
5230,"rate, we shall learn something.” The Vicar stood with his hands on the"
5230,"table."
5230,""
5230,"“Diary,” repeated Cuss, sitting down, putting two volumes to support"
5230,"the third, and opening it. “H’m—no name on the fly-leaf."
5230,"Bother!—cypher. And figures.”"
5230,""
5230,"The vicar came round to look over his shoulder."
5230,""
5230,"Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed. “I’m—dear"
5230,"me! It’s all cypher, Bunting.”"
5230,""
5230,"“There are no diagrams?” asked Mr. Bunting. “No illustrations throwing"
5230,"light—”"
5230,""
5230,"“See for yourself,” said Mr. Cuss. “Some of it’s mathematical and some"
5230,"of it’s Russian or some such language (to judge by the letters), and"
5230,"some of it’s Greek. Now the Greek I thought _you_—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Of course,” said Mr. Bunting, taking out and wiping his spectacles and"
5230,"feeling suddenly very uncomfortable—for he had no Greek left in his"
5230,"mind worth talking about; “yes—the Greek, of course, may furnish a"
5230,"clue.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll find you a place.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’d rather glance through the volumes first,” said Mr. Bunting, still"
5230,"wiping. “A general impression first, Cuss, and _then_, you know, we can"
5230,"go looking for clues.”"
5230,""
5230,"He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed"
5230,"again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly"
5230,"inevitable exposure. Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a"
5230,"leisurely manner. And then something did happen."
5230,""
5230,"The door opened suddenly."
5230,""
5230,"Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved to"
5230,"see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat. “Tap?” asked the"
5230,"face, and stood staring."
5230,""
5230,"“No,” said both gentlemen at once."
5230,""
5230,"“Over the other side, my man,” said Mr. Bunting. And “Please shut that"
5230,"door,” said Mr. Cuss, irritably."
5230,""
5230,"“All right,” said the intruder, as it seemed in a low voice curiously"
5230,"different from the huskiness of its first inquiry. “Right you are,”"
5230,"said the intruder in the former voice. “Stand clear!” and he vanished"
5230,"and closed the door."
5230,""
5230,"“A sailor, I should judge,” said Mr. Bunting. “Amusing fellows, they"
5230,"are. Stand clear! indeed. A nautical term, referring to his getting"
5230,"back out of the room, I suppose.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I daresay so,” said Cuss. “My nerves are all loose to-day. It quite"
5230,"made me jump—the door opening like that.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Bunting smiled as if he had not jumped. “And now,” he said with a"
5230,"sigh, “these books.”"
5230,""
5230,"Someone sniffed as he did so."
5230,""
5230,"“One thing is indisputable,” said Bunting, drawing up a chair next to"
5230,"that of Cuss. “There certainly have been very strange things happen in"
5230,"Iping during the last few days—very strange. I cannot of course believe"
5230,"in this absurd invisibility story—”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s incredible,” said Cuss—“incredible. But the fact remains that I"
5230,"saw—I certainly saw right down his sleeve—”"
5230,""
5230,"“But did you—are you sure? Suppose a mirror, for instance—"
5230,"hallucinations are so easily produced. I don’t know if you have ever"
5230,"seen a really good conjuror—”"
5230,""
5230,"“I won’t argue again,” said Cuss. “We’ve thrashed that out, Bunting."
5230,"And just now there’s these books—Ah! here’s some of what I take to be"
5230,"Greek! Greek letters certainly.”"
5230,""
5230,"He pointed to the middle of the page. Mr. Bunting flushed slightly and"
5230,"brought his face nearer, apparently finding some difficulty with his"
5230,"glasses. Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of"
5230,"his neck. He tried to raise his head, and encountered an immovable"
5230,"resistance. The feeling was a curious pressure, the grip of a heavy,"
5230,"firm hand, and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table. “Don’t move,"
5230,"little men,” whispered a voice, “or I’ll brain you both!” He looked"
5230,"into the face of Cuss, close to his own, and each saw a horrified"
5230,"reflection of his own sickly astonishment."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m sorry to handle you so roughly,” said the Voice, “but it’s"
5230,"unavoidable.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator’s private"
5230,"memoranda,” said the Voice; and two chins struck the table"
5230,"simultaneously, and two sets of teeth rattled."
5230,""
5230,"“Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in"
5230,"misfortune?” and the concussion was repeated."
5230,""
5230,"“Where have they put my clothes?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Listen,” said the Voice. “The windows are fastened and I’ve taken the"
5230,"key out of the door. I am a fairly strong man, and I have the poker"
5230,"handy—besides being invisible. There’s not the slightest doubt that I"
5230,"could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted to—do you"
5230,"understand? Very well. If I let you go will you promise not to try any"
5230,"nonsense and do what I tell you?”"
5230,""
5230,"The vicar and the doctor looked at one another, and the doctor pulled a"
5230,"face. “Yes,” said Mr. Bunting, and the doctor repeated it. Then the"
5230,"pressure on the necks relaxed, and the doctor and the vicar sat up,"
5230,"both very red in the face and wriggling their heads."
5230,""
5230,"“Please keep sitting where you are,” said the Invisible Man. “Here’s"
5230,"the poker, you see.”"
5230,""
5230,"“When I came into this room,” continued the Invisible Man, after"
5230,"presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors, “I"
5230,"did not expect to find it occupied, and I expected to find, in addition"
5230,"to my books of memoranda, an outfit of clothing. Where is it? No—don’t"
5230,"rise. I can see it’s gone. Now, just at present, though the days are"
5230,"quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark, the evenings"
5230,"are quite chilly. I want clothing—and other accommodation; and I must"
5230,"also have those three books.”"

5230,"It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off"

5230,"“Hul-lo!” from the Tap."

5230,"Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely. “That ain’t right,” he said,"
5230,"and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door."
5230,""
5230,"He and Teddy approached the door together, with intent faces. Their"
5230,"eyes considered. “Summat wrong,” said Hall, and Henfrey nodded"
5230,"agreement. Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them, and there"
5230,"was a muffled sound of conversation, very rapid and subdued."
5230,""
5230,"“You all right thur?” asked Hall, rapping."
5230,""
5230,"The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence, then"
5230,"the conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a sharp cry of"
5230,"“No! no, you don’t!” There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of"
5230,"a chair, a brief struggle. Silence again."
5230,""
5230,"“What the dooce?” exclaimed Henfrey, _sotto voce_."
5230,""
5230,"“You—all—right thur?” asked Mr. Hall, sharply, again."
5230,""
5230,"The Vicar’s voice answered with a curious jerking intonation: “Quite"
5230,"ri-right. Please don’t—interrupt.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Odd!” said Mr. Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"“Odd!” said Mr. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“Says, ‘Don’t interrupt,’” said Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"“I heerd’n,” said Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“And a sniff,” said Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"They remained listening. The conversation was rapid and subdued. “I"
5230,"_can’t_,” said Mr. Bunting, his voice rising; “I tell you, sir, I"
5230,"_will_ not.”"
5230,""
5230,"“What was that?” asked Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"“Says he wi’ nart,” said Hall. “Warn’t speaking to us, wuz he?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Disgraceful!” said Mr. Bunting, within."
5230,""
5230,"“‘Disgraceful,’” said Mr. Henfrey. “I heard it—distinct.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Who’s that speaking now?” asked Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"“Mr. Cuss, I s’pose,” said Hall. “Can you hear—anything?”"
5230,""
5230,"Silence. The sounds within indistinct and perplexing."
5230,""
5230,"“Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about,” said Hall."
5230,""
5230,"Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar. Hall made gestures of silence and"
5230,"invitation. This aroused Mrs. Hall’s wifely opposition. “What yer"
5230,"listenin’ there for, Hall?” she asked. “Ain’t you nothin’ better to"
5230,"do—busy day like this?”"
5230,""
5230,"Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs."
5230,"Hall was obdurate. She raised her voice. So Hall and Henfrey, rather"
5230,"crestfallen, tiptoed back to the bar, gesticulating to explain to her."
5230,""
5230,"At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all."
5230,"Then she insisted on Hall keeping silence, while Henfrey told her his"
5230,"story. She was inclined to think the whole business nonsense—perhaps"
5230,"they were just moving the furniture about. “I heerd’n say"
5230,"‘disgraceful’; _that_ I did,” said Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“_I_ heerd that, Mrs. Hall,” said Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"“Like as not—” began Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“Hsh!” said Mr. Teddy Henfrey. “Didn’t I hear the window?”"
5230,""
5230,"“What window?” asked Mrs. Hall."
5230,""
5230,"“Parlour window,” said Henfrey."
5230,""
5230,"Everyone stood listening intently. Mrs. Hall’s eyes, directed straight"
5230,"before her, saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door,"
5230,"the road white and vivid, and Huxter’s shop-front blistering in the"
5230,"June sun. Abruptly Huxter’s door opened and Huxter appeared, eyes"
5230,"staring with excitement, arms gesticulating. “Yap!” cried Huxter. “Stop"
5230,"thief!” and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates,"
5230,"and vanished."
5230,""
5230,"Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour, and a sound of windows"
5230,"being closed."
5230,""
5230,"Hall, Henfrey, and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once"
5230,"pell-mell into the street. They saw someone whisk round the corner"
5230,"towards the road, and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the"
5230,"air that ended on his face and shoulder. Down the street people were"
5230,"standing astonished or running towards them."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Huxter was stunned. Henfrey stopped to discover this, but Hall and"
5230,"the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner, shouting"
5230,"incoherent things, and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the"
5230,"church wall. They appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion"
5230,"that this was the Invisible Man suddenly become visible, and set off at"
5230,"once along the lane in pursuit. But Hall had hardly run a dozen yards"
5230,"before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong"
5230,"sideways, clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the"
5230,"ground. He had been charged just as one charges a man at football. The"
5230,"second labourer came round in a circle, stared, and conceiving that"
5230,"Hall had tumbled over of his own accord, turned to resume the pursuit,"
5230,"only to be tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been. Then, as the"
5230,"first labourer struggled to his feet, he was kicked sideways by a blow"
5230,"that might have felled an ox."
5230,""
5230,"As he went down, the rush from the direction of the village green came"
5230,"round the corner. The first to appear was the proprietor of the"
5230,"cocoanut shy, a burly man in a blue jersey. He was astonished to see"
5230,"the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground. And"
5230,"then something happened to his rear-most foot, and he went headlong and"
5230,"rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and"
5230,"partner, following headlong. The two were then kicked, knelt on, fallen"
5230,"over, and cursed by quite a number of over-hasty people."
5230,""
5230,"Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house, Mrs."
5230,"Hall, who had been disciplined by years of experience, remained in the"
5230,"bar next the till. And suddenly the parlour door was opened, and Mr."
5230,"Cuss appeared, and without glancing at her rushed at once down the"
5230,"steps toward the corner. “Hold him!” he cried. “Don’t let him drop that"
5230,"parcel.”"
5230,""
5230,"He knew nothing of the existence of Marvel. For the Invisible Man had"
5230,"handed over the books and bundle in the yard. The face of Mr. Cuss was"
5230,"angry and resolute, but his costume was defective, a sort of limp white"
5230,"kilt that could only have passed muster in Greece. “Hold him!” he"
5230,"bawled. “He’s got my trousers! And every stitch of the Vicar’s"
5230,"clothes!”"
5230,""
5230,"“’Tend to him in a minute!” he cried to Henfrey as he passed the"
5230,"prostrate Huxter, and, coming round the corner to join the tumult, was"
5230,"promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl. Somebody in"
5230,"full flight trod heavily on his finger. He yelled, struggled to regain"
5230,"his feet, was knocked against and thrown on all fours again, and became"
5230,"aware that he was involved not in a capture, but a rout. Everyone was"
5230,"running back to the village. He rose again and was hit severely behind"
5230,"the ear. He staggered and set off back to the “Coach and Horses”"
5230,"forthwith, leaping over the deserted Huxter, who was now sitting up, on"
5230,"his way."
5230,""
5230,"Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of"
5230,"rage, rising sharply out of the confusion of cries, and a sounding"
5230,"smack in someone’s face. He recognised the voice as that of the"
5230,"Invisible Man, and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a"
5230,"painful blow."
5230,""
5230,"In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour. “He’s coming back,"
5230,"Bunting!” he said, rushing in. “Save yourself!”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe"
5230,"himself in the hearth-rug and a _West Surrey Gazette_. “Who’s coming?”"
5230,"he said, so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration."
5230,""
5230,"“Invisible Man,” said Cuss, and rushed on to the window. “We’d better"
5230,"clear out from here! He’s fighting mad! Mad!”"
5230,""
5230,"In another moment he was out in the yard."
5230,""
5230,"“Good heavens!” said Mr. Bunting, hesitating between two horrible"
5230,"alternatives. He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn,"
5230,"and his decision was made. He clambered out of the window, adjusted his"
5230,"costume hastily, and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs"
5230,"would carry him."
5230,""
5230,"From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr."
5230,"Bunting made his memorable flight up the village, it became impossible"
5230,"to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping. Possibly the"
5230,"Invisible Man’s original intention was simply to cover Marvel’s retreat"
5230,"with the clothes and books. But his temper, at no time very good, seems"
5230,"to have gone completely at some chance blow, and forthwith he set to"
5230,"smiting and overthrowing, for the mere satisfaction of hurting."
5230,""
5230,"You must figure the street full of running figures, of doors slamming"
5230,"and fights for hiding-places. You must figure the tumult suddenly"
5230,"striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher’s planks and two"
5230,"chairs—with cataclysmic results. You must figure an appalled couple"
5230,"caught dismally in a swing. And then the whole tumultuous rush has"
5230,"passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save"
5230,"for the still raging unseen, and littered with cocoanuts, overthrown"
5230,"canvas screens, and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall."
5230,"Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts, and"
5230,"the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised"
5230,"eyebrow in the corner of a window pane."
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the"
5230,"windows in the “Coach and Horses,” and then he thrust a street lamp"
5230,"through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble. He it must have been who"
5230,"cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins’ cottage on the"
5230,"Adderdean road. And after that, as his peculiar qualities allowed, he"
5230,"passed out of human perceptions altogether, and he was neither heard,"
5230,"seen, nor felt in Iping any more. He vanished absolutely."
5230,""
5230,"But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured"
5230,"out again into the desolation of Iping street."

5230,"When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep"
5230,"timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday,"
5230,"a short, thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully"
5230,"through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst."
5230,"He carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental"
5230,"elastic ligature, and a bundle wrapped in a blue table-cloth. His"
5230,"rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue; he appeared to be in"
5230,"a spasmodic sort of hurry. He was accompanied by a voice other than his"
5230,"own, and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands."
5230,""
5230,"“If you give me the slip again,” said the Voice, “if you attempt to"
5230,"give me the slip again—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Lord!” said Mr. Marvel. “That shoulder’s a mass of bruises as it is.”"
5230,""
5230,"“On my honour,” said the Voice, “I will kill you.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I didn’t try to give you the slip,” said Marvel, in a voice that was"
5230,"not far remote from tears. “I swear I didn’t. I didn’t know the blessed"
5230,"turning, that was all! How the devil was I to know the blessed turning?"
5230,"As it is, I’ve been knocked about—”"
5230,""
5230,"“You’ll get knocked about a great deal more if you don’t mind,” said"
5230,"the Voice, and Mr. Marvel abruptly became silent. He blew out his"
5230,"cheeks, and his eyes were eloquent of despair."
5230,""
5230,"“It’s bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little"
5230,"secret, without _your_ cutting off with my books. It’s lucky for some"

5230,""
5230,"“What am _I_ to do?” asked Marvel, _sotto voce_."

5230,"The despair of Mr. Marvel’s face deepened, and his pace slackened."

5230,"“Go on!” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel’s face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches."

5230,"AT PORT STOWE"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Ten o’clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel, unshaven, dirty, and"
5230,"travel-stained, sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in"
5230,"his pockets, looking very weary, nervous, and uncomfortable, and"
5230,"inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals, on the bench outside a"
5230,"little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe. Beside him were the books,"
5230,"but now they were tied with string. The bundle had been abandoned in"
5230,"the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst, in accordance with a change in the"
5230,"plans of the Invisible Man. Mr. Marvel sat on the bench, and although"
5230,"no one took the slightest notice of him, his agitation remained at"
5230,"fever heat. His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets"
5230,"with a curious nervous fumbling."
5230,""
5230,"When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour, however, an"
5230,"elderly mariner, carrying a newspaper, came out of the inn and sat down"
5230,"beside him. “Pleasant day,” said the mariner."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror. “Very,”"
5230,"he said."
5230,""
5230,"“Just seasonable weather for the time of year,” said the mariner,"
5230,"taking no denial."
5230,""
5230,"“Quite,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"The mariner produced a toothpick, and (saving his regard) was engrossed"
5230,"thereby for some minutes. His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine"
5230,"Mr. Marvel’s dusty figure, and the books beside him. As he had"
5230,"approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins"
5230,"into a pocket. He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel’s appearance"
5230,"with this suggestion of opulence. Thence his mind wandered back again"
5230,"to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination."
5230,""
5230,"“Books?” he said suddenly, noisily finishing with the toothpick."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel started and looked at them. “Oh, yes,” he said. “Yes,"
5230,"they’re books.”"

5230,"instance.”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his"

5230,"“Ostria, or America?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Neither,” said the mariner. “_Here_.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Lord!” said Mr. Marvel, starting."
5230,""
5230,"“When I say _here_,” said the mariner, to Mr. Marvel’s intense relief,"
5230,"“I don’t of course mean here in this place, I mean hereabouts.”"

5230,"“An Invisible Man!” said Mr. Marvel. “And what’s _he_ been up to?”"

5230,"“I should think it was enough,” said the mariner. “I should think it"
5230,"was enough.”"
5230,""
5230,"“He didn’t have any pals—it don’t say he had any pals, does it?” asked"
5230,"Mr. Marvel, anxious."
5230,""
5230,"“Ain’t one of a sort enough for you?” asked the mariner. “No, thank"
5230,"Heaven, as one might say, he didn’t.”"
5230,""
5230,"He nodded his head slowly. “It makes me regular uncomfortable, the bare"
5230,"thought of that chap running about the country! He is at present At"
5230,"Large, and from certain evidence it is supposed that he"
5230,"has—taken—_took_, I suppose they mean—the road to Port Stowe. You see"
5230,"we’re right _in_ it! None of your American wonders, this time. And just"
5230,"think of the things he might do! Where’d you be, if he took a drop over"
5230,"and above, and had a fancy to go for you? Suppose he wants to rob—who"
5230,"can prevent him? He can trespass, he can burgle, he could walk through"
5230,"a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a"
5230,"blind man! Easier! For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp, I’m"
5230,"told. And wherever there was liquor he fancied—”"
5230,""
5230,"“He’s got a tremenjous advantage, certainly,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,"“And—well...”"
5230,""
5230,"“You’re right,” said the mariner. “He _has_.”"
5230,""
5230,"All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently,"
5230,"listening for faint footfalls, trying to detect imperceptible"
5230,"movements. He seemed on the point of some great resolution. He coughed"
5230,"behind his hand."
5230,""
5230,"He looked about him again, listened, bent towards the mariner, and"
5230,"lowered his voice: “The fact of it is—I happen—to know just a thing or"
5230,"two about this Invisible Man. From private sources.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Oh!” said the mariner, interested. “_You_?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes,” said Mr. Marvel. “Me.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Indeed!” said the mariner. “And may I ask—”"
5230,""
5230,"“You’ll be astonished,” said Mr. Marvel behind his hand. “It’s"
5230,"tremenjous.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Indeed!” said the mariner."
5230,""
5230,"“The fact is,” began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone."
5230,"Suddenly his expression changed marvellously. “Ow!” he said. He rose"
5230,"stiffly in his seat. His face was eloquent of physical suffering."
5230,"“Wow!” he said."
5230,""
5230,"“What’s up?” said the mariner, concerned."
5230,""
5230,"“Toothache,” said Mr. Marvel, and put his hand to his ear. He caught"
5230,"hold of his books. “I must be getting on, I think,” he said. He edged"
5230,"in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor. “But you"
5230,"was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man!” protested"
5230,"the mariner. Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself. “Hoax,” said a"
5230,"Voice. “It’s a hoax,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“But it’s in the paper,” said the mariner."
5230,""
5230,"“Hoax all the same,” said Marvel. “I know the chap that started the"
5230,"lie. There ain’t no Invisible Man whatsoever—Blimey.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But how ’bout this paper? D’you mean to say—?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not a word of it,” said Marvel, stoutly."
5230,""
5230,"The mariner stared, paper in hand. Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about."
5230,"“Wait a bit,” said the mariner, rising and speaking slowly, “D’you mean"
5230,"to say—?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I do,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff,"
5230,"then? What d’yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that"
5230,"for? Eh?”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks. The mariner was suddenly very red"
5230,"indeed; he clenched his hands. “I been talking here this ten minutes,”"
5230,"he said; “and you, you little pot-bellied, leathery-faced son of an old"
5230,"boot, couldn’t have the elementary manners—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t you come bandying words with _me_,” said Mr. Marvel."
5230,""
5230,"“Bandying words! I’m a jolly good mind—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Come up,” said a Voice, and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about and"
5230,"started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner. “You’d better move"
5230,"on,” said the mariner. “Who’s moving on?” said Mr. Marvel. He was"
5230,"receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait, with occasional"
5230,"violent jerks forward. Some way along the road he began a muttered"
5230,"monologue, protests and recriminations."
5230,""
5230,"“Silly devil!” said the mariner, legs wide apart, elbows akimbo,"
5230,"watching the receding figure. “I’ll show you, you silly ass—hoaxing"
5230,"_me_! It’s here—on the paper!”"
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and, receding, was hidden by a bend in"
5230,"the road, but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the"
5230,"way, until the approach of a butcher’s cart dislodged him. Then he"
5230,"turned himself towards Port Stowe. “Full of extra-ordinary asses,” he"
5230,"said softly to himself. “Just to take me down a bit—that was his silly"
5230,"game—It’s on the paper!”"
5230,""
5230,"And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear,"
5230,"that had happened quite close to him. And that was a vision of a “fist"
5230,"full of money” (no less) travelling without visible agency, along by"
5230,"the wall at the corner of St. Michael’s Lane. A brother mariner had"
5230,"seen this wonderful sight that very morning. He had snatched at the"
5230,"money forthwith and had been knocked headlong, and when he had got to"
5230,"his feet the butterfly money had vanished. Our mariner was in the mood"
5230,"to believe anything, he declared, but that was a bit _too_ stiff."
5230,"Afterwards, however, he began to think things over."
5230,""
5230,"The story of the flying money was true. And all about that"
5230,"neighbourhood, even from the august London and Country Banking Company,"
5230,"from the tills of shops and inns—doors standing that sunny weather"
5230,"entirely open—money had been quietly and dexterously making off that"
5230,"day in handfuls and rouleaux, floating quietly along by walls and shady"
5230,"places, dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men. And it had,"
5230,"though no man had traced it, invariably ended its mysterious flight in"
5230,"the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat, sitting"
5230,"outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe."
5230,""
5230,"It was ten days after—and indeed only when the Burdock story was"
5230,"already old—that the mariner collated these facts and began to"
5230,"understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man."
5230,""

5230,""
5230,"CHAPTER XV."
5230,"THE MAN WHO WAS RUNNING"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the"
5230,"belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock. It was a pleasant little"
5230,"room, with three windows—north, west, and south—and bookshelves covered"
5230,"with books and scientific publications, and a broad writing-table, and,"
5230,"under the north window, a microscope, glass slips, minute instruments,"
5230,"some cultures, and scattered bottles of reagents. Dr. Kemp’s solar lamp"
5230,"was lit, albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light, and his"
5230,"blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to"
5230,"require them pulled down. Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man,"
5230,"with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white, and the work he was upon"
5230,"would earn him, he hoped, the fellowship of the Royal Society, so"
5230,"highly did he think of it."
5230,""
5230,"And his eye, presently wandering from his work, caught the sunset"
5230,"blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own. For a"
5230,"minute perhaps he sat, pen in mouth, admiring the rich golden colour"
5230,"above the crest, and then his attention was attracted by the little"
5230,"figure of a man, inky black, running over the hill-brow towards him. He"
5230,"was a shortish little man, and he wore a high hat, and he was running"
5230,"so fast that his legs verily twinkled."
5230,""
5230,"“Another of those fools,” said Dr. Kemp. “Like that ass who ran into me"
5230,"this morning round a corner, with the ‘’Visible Man a-coming, sir!’ I"
5230,"can’t imagine what possesses people. One might think we were in the"
5230,"thirteenth century.”"
5230,""
5230,"He got up, went to the window, and stared at the dusky hillside, and"
5230,"the dark little figure tearing down it. “He seems in a confounded"
5230,"hurry,” said Dr. Kemp, “but he doesn’t seem to be getting on. If his"
5230,"pockets were full of lead, he couldn’t run heavier.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Spurted, sir,” said Dr. Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the"
5230,"hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure. He was visible again"
5230,"for a moment, and again, and then again, three times between the three"
5230,"detached houses that came next, and then the terrace hid him."
5230,""
5230,"“Asses!” said Dr. Kemp, swinging round on his heel and walking back to"
5230,"his writing-table."
5230,""
5230,"But those who saw the fugitive nearer, and perceived the abject terror"
5230,"on his perspiring face, being themselves in the open roadway, did not"
5230,"share in the doctor’s contempt. By the man pounded, and as he ran he"
5230,"chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro. He looked"
5230,"neither to the right nor the left, but his dilated eyes stared straight"
5230,"downhill to where the lamps were being lit, and the people were crowded"
5230,"in the street. And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart, and a glairy foam"
5230,"lay on his lips, and his breath came hoarse and noisy. All he passed"
5230,"stopped and began staring up the road and down, and interrogating one"
5230,"another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste."
5230,""
5230,"And then presently, far up the hill, a dog playing in the road yelped"
5230,"and ran under a gate, and as they still wondered something—a wind—a"
5230,"pad, pad, pad,—a sound like a panting breathing, rushed by."
5230,""
5230,"People screamed. People sprang off the pavement: It passed in shouts,"
5230,"it passed by instinct down the hill. They were shouting in the street"
5230,"before Marvel was halfway there. They were bolting into houses and"
5230,"slamming the doors behind them, with the news. He heard it and made one"
5230,"last desperate spurt. Fear came striding by, rushed ahead of him, and"
5230,"in a moment had seized the town."
5230,""
5230,"“The Invisible Man is coming! The Invisible Man!”"

5230,"CHAPTER XVI."
5230,"IN THE “JOLLY CRICKETERS”"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"The “Jolly Cricketers” is just at the bottom of the hill, where the"
5230,"tram-lines begin. The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and"
5230,"talked of horses with an anaemic cabman, while a black-bearded man in"
5230,"grey snapped up biscuit and cheese, drank Burton, and conversed in"
5230,"American with a policeman off duty."
5230,""
5230,"“What’s the shouting about!” said the anaemic cabman, going off at a"
5230,"tangent, trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the"
5230,"low window of the inn. Somebody ran by outside. “Fire, perhaps,” said"
5230,"the barman."
5230,""
5230,"Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open"
5230,"violently, and Marvel, weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the neck"
5230,"of his coat torn open, rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and attempted"
5230,"to shut the door. It was held half open by a strap."
5230,""
5230,"“Coming!” he bawled, his voice shrieking with terror. “He’s coming. The"
5230,"’Visible Man! After me! For Gawd’s sake! ’Elp! ’Elp! ’Elp!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Shut the doors,” said the policeman. “Who’s coming? What’s the row?”"
5230,"He went to the door, released the strap, and it slammed. The American"
5230,"closed the other door."
5230,""
5230,"“Lemme go inside,” said Marvel, staggering and weeping, but still"
5230,"clutching the books. “Lemme go inside. Lock me in—somewhere. I tell you"
5230,"he’s after me. I give him the slip. He said he’d kill me and he will.”"
5230,""
5230,"“_You’re_ safe,” said the man with the black beard. “The door’s shut."
5230,"What’s it all about?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Lemme go inside,” said Marvel, and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly"
5230,"made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and"
5230,"a shouting outside. “Hullo,” cried the policeman, “who’s there?” Mr."
5230,"Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors."
5230,"“He’ll kill me—he’s got a knife or something. For Gawd’s sake—!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Here you are,” said the barman. “Come in here.” And he held up the"
5230,"flap of the bar."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated."
5230,"“Don’t open the door,” he screamed. “_Please_ don’t open the door."
5230,"_Where_ shall I hide?”"
5230,""
5230,"“This, this Invisible Man, then?” asked the man with the black beard,"
5230,"with one hand behind him. “I guess it’s about time we saw him.”"
5230,""
5230,"The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in, and there was a"
5230,"screaming and running to and fro in the street. The policeman had been"
5230,"standing on the settee staring out, craning to see who was at the door."
5230,"He got down with raised eyebrows. “It’s that,” he said. The barman"
5230,"stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now locked on Mr."
5230,"Marvel, stared at the smashed window, and came round to the two other"
5230,"men."
5230,""
5230,"Everything was suddenly quiet. “I wish I had my truncheon,” said the"
5230,"policeman, going irresolutely to the door. “Once we open, in he comes."
5230,"There’s no stopping him.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t you be in too much hurry about that door,” said the anaemic"
5230,"cabman, anxiously."
5230,""
5230,"“Draw the bolts,” said the man with the black beard, “and if he comes—”"
5230,"He showed a revolver in his hand."
5230,""
5230,"“That won’t do,” said the policeman; “that’s murder.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I know what country I’m in,” said the man with the beard. “I’m going"
5230,"to let off at his legs. Draw the bolts.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not with that blinking thing going off behind me,” said the barman,"
5230,"craning over the blind."
5230,""
5230,"“Very well,” said the man with the black beard, and stooping down,"
5230,"revolver ready, drew them himself. Barman, cabman, and policeman faced"
5230,"about."
5230,""
5230,"“Come in,” said the bearded man in an undertone, standing back and"
5230,"facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him. No one came in,"
5230,"the door remained closed. Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman"
5230,"pushed his head in cautiously, they were still waiting, and an anxious"
5230,"face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information. “Are all"
5230,"the doors of the house shut?” asked Marvel. “He’s going round—prowling"
5230,"round. He’s as artful as the devil.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Good Lord!” said the burly barman. “There’s the back! Just watch them"
5230,"doors! I say—!” He looked about him helplessly. The bar-parlour door"
5230,"slammed and they heard the key turn. “There’s the yard door and the"
5230,"private door. The yard door—”"
5230,""
5230,"He rushed out of the bar."
5230,""
5230,"In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand. “The yard"
5230,"door was open!” he said, and his fat underlip dropped. “He may be in"
5230,"the house now!” said the first cabman."
5230,""
5230,"“He’s not in the kitchen,” said the barman. “There’s two women there,"
5230,"and I’ve stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer. And"
5230,"they don’t think he’s come in. They haven’t noticed—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Have you fastened it?” asked the first cabman."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m out of frocks,” said the barman."
5230,""
5230,"The man with the beard replaced his revolver. And even as he did so the"
5230,"flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked, and then with a"
5230,"tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door"
5230,"burst open. They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret, and"
5230,"forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue. The bearded"
5230,"man’s revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour"
5230,"starred and came smashing and tinkling down."
5230,""
5230,"As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel, curiously crumpled up and"
5230,"struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen. The door"
5230,"flew open while the barman hesitated, and Marvel was dragged into the"
5230,"kitchen. There was a scream and a clatter of pans. Marvel, head down,"
5230,"and lugging back obstinately, was forced to the kitchen door, and the"
5230,"bolts were drawn."
5230,""
5230,"Then the policeman, who had been trying to pass the barman, rushed in,"
5230,"followed by one of the cabmen, gripped the wrist of the invisible hand"
5230,"that collared Marvel, was hit in the face and went reeling back. The"
5230,"door opened, and Marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment"
5230,"behind it. Then the cabman collared something. “I got him,” said the"
5230,"cabman. The barman’s red hands came clawing at the unseen. “Here he"
5230,"is!” said the barman."
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Marvel, released, suddenly dropped to the ground and made an"
5230,"attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men. The struggle"
5230,"blundered round the edge of the door. The voice of the Invisible Man"
5230,"was heard for the first time, yelling out sharply, as the policeman"
5230,"trod on his foot. Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew"
5230,"round like flails. The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up, kicked"
5230,"under the diaphragm. The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen"
5230,"slammed and covered Mr. Marvel’s retreat. The men in the kitchen found"
5230,"themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air."
5230,""
5230,"“Where’s he gone?” cried the man with the beard. “Out?”"
5230,""
5230,"“This way,” said the policeman, stepping into the yard and stopping."
5230,""
5230,"A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on"
5230,"the kitchen table."
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll show him,” shouted the man with the black beard, and suddenly a"
5230,"steel barrel shone over the policeman’s shoulder, and five bullets had"
5230,"followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come. As"
5230,"he fired, the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve,"
5230,"so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a"
5230,"wheel."
5230,""
5230,"A silence followed. “Five cartridges,” said the man with the black"
5230,"beard. “That’s the best of all. Four aces and a joker. Get a lantern,"
5230,"someone, and come and feel about for his body.”"

5230,"DR. KEMP’S VISITOR"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused"
5230,"him. Crack, crack, crack, they came one after the other."
5230,""
5230,"“Hullo!” said Dr. Kemp, putting his pen into his mouth again and"
5230,"listening. “Who’s letting off revolvers in Burdock? What are the asses"
5230,"at now?”"
5230,""
5230,"He went to the south window, threw it up, and leaning out stared down"
5230,"on the network of windows, beaded gas-lamps and shops, with its black"
5230,"interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night. “Looks"
5230,"like a crowd down the hill,” he said, “by ‘The Cricketers,’” and"
5230,"remained watching. Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away"
5230,"where the ships’ lights shone, and the pier glowed—a little"
5230,"illuminated, facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light. The moon in"
5230,"its first quarter hung over the westward hill, and the stars were clear"
5230,"and almost tropically bright."
5230,""
5230,"After five minutes, during which his mind had travelled into a remote"
5230,"speculation of social conditions of the future, and lost itself at last"
5230,"over the time dimension, Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh, pulled"
5230,"down the window again, and returned to his writing desk."
5230,""
5230,"It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell"
5230,"rang. He had been writing slackly, and with intervals of abstraction,"
5230,"since the shots. He sat listening. He heard the servant answer the"
5230,"door, and waited for her feet on the staircase, but she did not come."
5230,"“Wonder what that was,” said Dr. Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"He tried to resume his work, failed, got up, went downstairs from his"
5230,"study to the landing, rang, and called over the balustrade to the"
5230,"housemaid as she appeared in the hall below. “Was that a letter?” he"
5230,"asked."
5230,""
5230,"“Only a runaway ring, sir,” she answered."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m restless to-night,” he said to himself. He went back to his study,"
5230,"and this time attacked his work resolutely. In a little while he was"
5230,"hard at work again, and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of"
5230,"the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill, hurrying in the very"
5230,"centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table."
5230,""
5230,"It was two o’clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the night."
5230,"He rose, yawned, and went downstairs to bed. He had already removed his"
5230,"coat and vest, when he noticed that he was thirsty. He took a candle"
5230,"and went down to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey."
5230,""
5230,"Dr. Kemp’s scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man, and"
5230,"as he recrossed the hall, he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near"
5230,"the mat at the foot of the stairs. He went on upstairs, and then it"
5230,"suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum"
5230,"might be. Apparently some subconscious element was at work. At any"
5230,"rate, he turned with his burden, went back to the hall, put down the"
5230,"syphon and whiskey, and bending down, touched the spot. Without any"
5230,"great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying"
5230,"blood."
5230,""
5230,"He took up his burden again, and returned upstairs, looking about him"
5230,"and trying to account for the blood-spot. On the landing he saw"
5230,"something and stopped astonished. The door-handle of his own room was"
5230,"blood-stained."
5230,""
5230,"He looked at his own hand. It was quite clean, and then he remembered"
5230,"that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his"
5230,"study, and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all. He"
5230,"went straight into his room, his face quite calm—perhaps a trifle more"
5230,"resolute than usual. His glance, wandering inquisitively, fell on the"
5230,"bed. On the counterpane was a mess of blood, and the sheet had been"
5230,"torn. He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to"
5230,"the dressing-table. On the further side the bedclothes were depressed"
5230,"as if someone had been recently sitting there."
5230,""
5230,"Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say, “Good"
5230,"Heavens!—Kemp!” But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices."
5230,""
5230,"He stood staring at the tumbled sheets. Was that really a voice? He"
5230,"looked about again, but noticed nothing further than the disordered and"
5230,"blood-stained bed. Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room,"
5230,"near the wash-hand stand. All men, however highly educated, retain some"
5230,"superstitious inklings. The feeling that is called “eerie” came upon"
5230,"him. He closed the door of the room, came forward to the"
5230,"dressing-table, and put down his burdens. Suddenly, with a start, he"
5230,"perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in"
5230,"mid-air, between him and the wash-hand stand."
5230,""
5230,"He stared at this in amazement. It was an empty bandage, a bandage"
5230,"properly tied but quite empty. He would have advanced to grasp it, but"
5230,"a touch arrested him, and a voice speaking quite close to him."
5230,""
5230,"“Kemp!” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“Eh?” said Kemp, with his mouth open."
5230,""
5230,"“Keep your nerve,” said the Voice. “I’m an Invisible Man.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp made no answer for a space, simply stared at the bandage."
5230,"“Invisible Man,” he said."
5230,""
5230,"“I am an Invisible Man,” repeated the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed"
5230,"through Kemp’s brain. He does not appear to have been either very much"
5230,"frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment. Realisation came"
5230,"later."
5230,""
5230,"“I thought it was all a lie,” he said. The thought uppermost in his"
5230,"mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning. “Have you a bandage"
5230,"on?” he asked."
5230,""
5230,"“Yes,” said the Invisible Man."
5230,""
5230,"“Oh!” said Kemp, and then roused himself. “I say!” he said. “But this"
5230,"is nonsense. It’s some trick.” He stepped forward suddenly, and his"
5230,"hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers."
5230,""
5230,"He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed."
5230,""
5230,"“Keep steady, Kemp, for God’s sake! I want help badly. Stop!”"
5230,""
5230,"The hand gripped his arm. He struck at it."
5230,""
5230,"“Kemp!” cried the Voice. “Kemp! Keep steady!” and the grip tightened."
5230,""
5230,"A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp. The hand of"
5230,"the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly tripped and"
5230,"flung backwards upon the bed. He opened his mouth to shout, and the"
5230,"corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth. The Invisible Man had"
5230,"him down grimly, but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick"
5230,"savagely."
5230,""
5230,"“Listen to reason, will you?” said the Invisible Man, sticking to him"
5230,"in spite of a pounding in the ribs. “By Heaven! you’ll madden me in a"
5230,"minute!"
5230,""
5230,"“Lie still, you fool!” bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp’s ear."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still."
5230,""
5230,"“If you shout, I’ll smash your face,” said the Invisible Man, relieving"
5230,"his mouth."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m an Invisible Man. It’s no foolishness, and no magic. I really am"
5230,"an Invisible Man. And I want your help. I don’t want to hurt you, but"
5230,"if you behave like a frantic rustic, I must. Don’t you remember me,"
5230,"Kemp? Griffin, of University College?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Let me get up,” said Kemp. “I’ll stop where I am. And let me sit quiet"
5230,"for a minute.”"
5230,""
5230,"He sat up and felt his neck."
5230,""
5230,"“I am Griffin, of University College, and I have made myself invisible."
5230,"I am just an ordinary man—a man you have known—made invisible.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Griffin?” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Griffin,” answered the Voice. A younger student than you were, almost"
5230,"an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white face and red"
5230,"eyes, who won the medal for chemistry.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I am confused,” said Kemp. “My brain is rioting. What has this to do"
5230,"with Griffin?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I _am_ Griffin.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp thought. “It’s horrible,” he said. “But what devilry must happen"
5230,"to make a man invisible?”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s no devilry. It’s a process, sane and intelligible enough—”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s horrible!” said Kemp. “How on earth—?”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s horrible enough. But I’m wounded and in pain, and tired ... Great"
5230,"God! Kemp, you are a man. Take it steady. Give me some food and drink,"
5230,"and let me sit down here.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a"
5230,"basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed. It"
5230,"creaked, and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so. He"
5230,"rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again. “This beats ghosts,” he said,"
5230,"and laughed stupidly."
5230,""
5230,"“That’s better. Thank Heaven, you’re getting sensible!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Or silly,” said Kemp, and knuckled his eyes."
5230,""
5230,"“Give me some whiskey. I’m near dead.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It didn’t feel so. Where are you? If I get up shall I run into you?"
5230,"_There_! all right. Whiskey? Here. Where shall I give it to you?”"
5230,""
5230,"The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him. He let"
5230,"go by an effort; his instinct was all against it. It came to rest"
5230,"poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair. He"
5230,"stared at it in infinite perplexity. “This is—this must be—hypnotism."
5230,"You have suggested you are invisible.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Nonsense,” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"“It’s frantic.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Listen to me.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I demonstrated conclusively this morning,” began Kemp, “that"
5230,"invisibility—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Never mind what you’ve demonstrated!—I’m starving,” said the Voice,"
5230,"“and the night is chilly to a man without clothes.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Food?” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself. “Yes,” said the Invisible Man"
5230,"rapping it down. “Have you a dressing-gown?”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone. He walked to a wardrobe and"
5230,"produced a robe of dingy scarlet. “This do?” he asked. It was taken"
5230,"from him. It hung limp for a moment in mid-air, fluttered weirdly,"
5230,"stood full and decorous buttoning itself, and sat down in his chair."
5230,"“Drawers, socks, slippers would be a comfort,” said the Unseen, curtly."
5230,"“And food.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Anything. But this is the insanest thing I ever was in, in my life!”"
5230,""
5230,"He turned out his drawers for the articles, and then went downstairs to"
5230,"ransack his larder. He came back with some cold cutlets and bread,"
5230,"pulled up a light table, and placed them before his guest. “Never mind"
5230,"knives,” said his visitor, and a cutlet hung in mid-air, with a sound"
5230,"of gnawing."
5230,""
5230,"“Invisible!” said Kemp, and sat down on a bedroom chair."
5230,""
5230,"“I always like to get something about me before I eat,” said the"
5230,"Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily. “Queer fancy!”"
5230,""
5230,"“I suppose that wrist is all right,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Trust me,” said the Invisible Man."
5230,""
5230,"“Of all the strange and wonderful—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Exactly. But it’s odd I should blunder into _your_ house to get my"
5230,"bandaging. My first stroke of luck! Anyhow I meant to sleep in this"
5230,"house to-night. You must stand that! It’s a filthy nuisance, my blood"
5230,"showing, isn’t it? Quite a clot over there. Gets visible as it"
5230,"coagulates, I see. It’s only the living tissue I’ve changed, and only"
5230,"for as long as I’m alive.... I’ve been in the house three hours.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But how’s it done?” began Kemp, in a tone of exasperation. “Confound"
5230,"it! The whole business—it’s unreasonable from beginning to end.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Quite reasonable,” said the Invisible Man. “Perfectly reasonable.”"
5230,""
5230,"He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle. Kemp stared at the"
5230,"devouring dressing gown. A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch"
5230,"in the right shoulder, made a triangle of light under the left ribs."
5230,"“What were the shots?” he asked. “How did the shooting begin?”"
5230,""
5230,"“There was a real fool of a man—a sort of confederate of mine—curse"
5230,"him!—who tried to steal my money. _Has_ done so.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Is _he_ invisible too?”"
5230,""
5230,"“No.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Can’t I have some more to eat before I tell you all that? I’m"
5230,"hungry—in pain. And you want me to tell stories!”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp got up. “_You_ didn’t do any shooting?” he asked."
5230,""
5230,"“Not me,” said his visitor. “Some fool I’d never seen fired at random."
5230,"A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me. Curse them!—I"
5230,"say—I want more to eat than this, Kemp.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll see what there is to eat downstairs,” said Kemp. “Not much, I’m"
5230,"afraid.”"
5230,""
5230,"After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man"
5230,"demanded a cigar. He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a"
5230,"knife, and cursed when the outer leaf loosened. It was strange to see"
5230,"him smoking; his mouth, and throat, pharynx and nares, became visible"
5230,"as a sort of whirling smoke cast."
5230,""
5230,"“This blessed gift of smoking!” he said, and puffed vigorously. “I’m"
5230,"lucky to have fallen upon you, Kemp. You must help me. Fancy tumbling"
5230,"on you just now! I’m in a devilish scrape—I’ve been mad, I think. The"
5230,"things I have been through! But we will do things yet. Let me tell"
5230,"you—”"
5230,""
5230,"He helped himself to more whiskey and soda. Kemp got up, looked about"
5230,"him, and fetched a glass from his spare room. “It’s wild—but I suppose"
5230,"I may drink.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You haven’t changed much, Kemp, these dozen years. You fair men don’t."
5230,"Cool and methodical—after the first collapse. I must tell you. We will"
5230,"work together!”"
5230,""
5230,"“But how was it all done?” said Kemp, “and how did you get like this?”"
5230,""
5230,"“For God’s sake, let me smoke in peace for a little while! And then I"
5230,"will begin to tell you.”"
5230,""
5230,"But the story was not told that night. The Invisible Man’s wrist was"
5230,"growing painful; he was feverish, exhausted, and his mind came round to"
5230,"brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn. He"
5230,"spoke in fragments of Marvel, he smoked faster, his voice grew angry."
5230,"Kemp tried to gather what he could."
5230,""
5230,"“He was afraid of me, I could see that he was afraid of me,” said the"
5230,"Invisible Man many times over. “He meant to give me the slip—he was"
5230,"always casting about! What a fool I was!"
5230,""
5230,"“The cur!"
5230,""
5230,"“I should have killed him!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Where did you get the money?” asked Kemp, abruptly."
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man was silent for a space. “I can’t tell you to-night,”"
5230,"he said."
5230,""
5230,"He groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his invisible head on"
5230,"invisible hands. “Kemp,” he said, “I’ve had no sleep for near three"
5230,"days, except a couple of dozes of an hour or so. I must sleep soon.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Well, have my room—have this room.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But how can I sleep? If I sleep—he will get away. Ugh! What does it"
5230,"matter?”"
5230,""
5230,"“What’s the shot wound?” asked Kemp, abruptly."
5230,""
5230,"“Nothing—scratch and blood. Oh, God! How I want sleep!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Why not?”"
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp. “Because I’ve a"
5230,"particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men,” he said slowly."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp started."
5230,""
5230,"“Fool that I am!” said the Invisible Man, striking the table smartly."
5230,"“I’ve put the idea into your head.”"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"CHAPTER XVIII."
5230,"THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was, he refused to accept"
5230,"Kemp’s word that his freedom should be respected. He examined the two"
5230,"windows of the bedroom, drew up the blinds and opened the sashes, to"
5230,"confirm Kemp’s statement that a retreat by them would be possible."
5230,"Outside the night was very quiet and still, and the new moon was"
5230,"setting over the down. Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the"
5230,"two dressing-room doors, to satisfy himself that these also could be"
5230,"made an assurance of freedom. Finally he expressed himself satisfied."
5230,"He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp heard the sound of a yawn."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m sorry,” said the Invisible Man, “if I cannot tell you all that I"
5230,"have done to-night. But I am worn out. It’s grotesque, no doubt. It’s"
5230,"horrible! But believe me, Kemp, in spite of your arguments of this"
5230,"morning, it is quite a possible thing. I have made a discovery. I meant"
5230,"to keep it to myself. I can’t. I must have a partner. And you.... We"
5230,"can do such things ... But to-morrow. Now, Kemp, I feel as though I"
5230,"must sleep or perish.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment."
5230,"“I suppose I must leave you,” he said. “It’s—incredible. Three things"
5230,"happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions—would make me"
5230,"insane. But it’s real! Is there anything more that I can get you?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Only bid me good-night,” said Griffin."
5230,""
5230,"“Good-night,” said Kemp, and shook an invisible hand. He walked"
5230,"sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards"
5230,"him. “Understand me!” said the dressing-gown. “No attempts to hamper"
5230,"me, or capture me! Or—”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp’s face changed a little. “I thought I gave you my word,” he said."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp closed the door softly behind him, and the key was turned upon him"
5230,"forthwith. Then, as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on"
5230,"his face, the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that"
5230,"too was locked. Kemp slapped his brow with his hand. “Am I dreaming?"
5230,"Has the world gone mad—or have I?”"
5230,""
5230,"He laughed, and put his hand to the locked door. “Barred out of my own"
5230,"bedroom, by a flagrant absurdity!” he said."
5230,""
5230,"He walked to the head of the staircase, turned, and stared at the"
5230,"locked doors. “It’s fact,” he said. He put his fingers to his slightly"
5230,"bruised neck. “Undeniable fact!"
5230,""
5230,"“But—”"
5230,""
5230,"He shook his head hopelessly, turned, and went downstairs."
5230,""
5230,"He lit the dining-room lamp, got out a cigar, and began pacing the"
5230,"room, ejaculating. Now and then he would argue with himself."
5230,""
5230,"“Invisible!” he said."
5230,""
5230,"“Is there such a thing as an invisible animal? ... In the sea, yes."
5230,"Thousands—millions. All the larvae, all the little nauplii and"
5230,"tornarias, all the microscopic things, the jelly-fish. In the sea there"
5230,"are more things invisible than visible! I never thought of that before."
5230,"And in the ponds too! All those little pond-life things—specks of"
5230,"colourless translucent jelly! But in air? No!"
5230,""
5230,"“It can’t be."
5230,""
5230,"“But after all—why not?"
5230,""
5230,"“If a man was made of glass he would still be visible.”"
5230,""
5230,"His meditation became profound. The bulk of three cigars had passed"
5230,"into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he"
5230,"spoke again. Then it was merely an exclamation. He turned aside, walked"
5230,"out of the room, and went into his little consulting-room and lit the"
5230,"gas there. It was a little room, because Dr. Kemp did not live by"
5230,"practice, and in it were the day’s newspapers. The morning’s paper lay"
5230,"carelessly opened and thrown aside. He caught it up, turned it over,"
5230,"and read the account of a “Strange Story from Iping” that the mariner"
5230,"at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr. Marvel. Kemp read it"
5230,"swiftly."
5230,""
5230,"“Wrapped up!” said Kemp. “Disguised! Hiding it! ‘No one seems to have"
5230,"been aware of his misfortune.’ What the devil _is_ his game?”"
5230,""
5230,"He dropped the paper, and his eye went seeking. “Ah!” he said, and"
5230,"caught up the _St. James’ Gazette_, lying folded up as it arrived. “Now"
5230,"we shall get at the truth,” said Dr. Kemp. He rent the paper open; a"
5230,"couple of columns confronted him. “An Entire Village in Sussex goes"
5230,"Mad” was the heading."
5230,""
5230,"“Good Heavens!” said Kemp, reading eagerly an incredulous account of"
5230,"the events in Iping, of the previous afternoon, that have already been"
5230,"described. Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been"
5230,"reprinted."
5230,""
5230,"He re-read it. “Ran through the streets striking right and left."
5230,"Jaffers insensible. Mr. Huxter in great pain—still unable to describe"
5230,"what he saw. Painful humiliation—vicar. Woman ill with terror! Windows"
5230,"smashed. This extraordinary story probably a fabrication. Too good not"
5230,"to print—_cum grano_!”"
5230,""
5230,"He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him. “Probably a"
5230,"fabrication!”"
5230,""
5230,"He caught up the paper again, and re-read the whole business. “But when"
5230,"does the Tramp come in? Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp?”"
5230,""
5230,"He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench. “He’s not only invisible,”"
5230,"he said, “but he’s mad! Homicidal!”"
5230,""
5230,"When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke"
5230,"of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing up and down, trying to grasp"
5230,"the incredible."
5230,""
5230,"He was altogether too excited to sleep. His servants, descending"
5230,"sleepily, discovered him, and were inclined to think that over-study"
5230,"had worked this ill on him. He gave them extraordinary but quite"
5230,"explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere"
5230,"study—and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor."
5230,"Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning’s paper"
5230,"came. That had much to say and little to tell, beyond the confirmation"
5230,"of the evening before, and a very badly written account of another"
5230,"remarkable tale from Port Burdock. This gave Kemp the essence of the"
5230,"happenings at the “Jolly Cricketers,” and the name of Marvel. “He has"
5230,"made me keep with him twenty-four hours,” Marvel testified. Certain"
5230,"minor facts were added to the Iping story, notably the cutting of the"
5230,"village telegraph-wire. But there was nothing to throw light on the"
5230,"connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp; for Mr. Marvel had"
5230,"supplied no information about the three books, or the money with which"
5230,"he was lined. The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of"

5230,""
5230,"Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get"
5230,"every one of the morning papers she could. These also he devoured."
5230,""
5230,"“He is invisible!” he said. “And it reads like rage growing to mania!"
5230,"The things he may do! The things he may do! And he’s upstairs free as"
5230,"the air. What on earth ought I to do?”"
5230,""
5230,"“For instance, would it be a breach of faith if—? No.”"
5230,""
5230,"He went to a little untidy desk in the corner, and began a note. He"
5230,"tore this up half written, and wrote another. He read it over and"
5230,"considered it. Then he took an envelope and addressed it to “Colonel"
5230,"Adye, Port Burdock.”"
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this. He awoke in an"
5230,"evil temper, and Kemp, alert for every sound, heard his pattering feet"

5230,"and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed. Kemp hurried upstairs and"
5230,"rapped eagerly."

5230,"CERTAIN FIRST PRINCIPLES"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"“What’s the matter?” asked Kemp, when the Invisible Man admitted him."
5230,""
5230,"“Nothing,” was the answer."
5230,""
5230,"“But, confound it! The smash?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Fit of temper,” said the Invisible Man. “Forgot this arm; and it’s"
5230,"sore.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You’re rather liable to that sort of thing.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I am.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken"
5230,"glass. “All the facts are out about you,” said Kemp, standing up with"
5230,"the glass in his hand; “all that happened in Iping, and down the hill."
5230,"The world has become aware of its invisible citizen. But no one knows"
5230,"you are here.”"
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man swore."
5230,""
5230,"“The secret’s out. I gather it was a secret. I don’t know what your"
5230,"plans are, but of course I’m anxious to help you.”"
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man sat down on the bed."
5230,""
5230,"“There’s breakfast upstairs,” said Kemp, speaking as easily as"
5230,"possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose"
5230,"willingly. Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere."
5230,""
5230,"“Before we can do anything else,” said Kemp, “I must understand a"
5230,"little more about this invisibility of yours.” He had sat down, after"
5230,"one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man who has"
5230,"talking to do. His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed"
5230,"and vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the"
5230,"breakfast-table—a headless, handless dressing-gown, wiping unseen lips"
5230,"on a miraculously held serviette."
5230,""
5230,"“It’s simple enough—and credible enough,” said Griffin, putting the"
5230,"serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand."
5230,""
5230,"“No doubt, to you, but—” Kemp laughed."
5230,""
5230,"“Well, yes; to me it seemed wonderful at first, no doubt. But now,"
5230,"great God! ... But we will do great things yet! I came on the stuff"
5230,"first at Chesilstowe.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Chesilstowe?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I went there after I left London. You know I dropped medicine and took"
5230,"up physics? No; well, I did. _Light_ fascinated me.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Ah!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Optical density! The whole subject is a network of riddles—a network"
5230,"with solutions glimmering elusively through. And being but"
5230,"two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm, I said, ‘I will devote my life"
5230,"to this. This is worth while.’ You know what fools we are at"
5230,"two-and-twenty?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Fools then or fools now,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man!"
5230,""
5230,"“But I went to work—like a slave. And I had hardly worked and thought"
5230,"about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes"
5230,"suddenly—blindingly! I found a general principle of pigments and"
5230,"refraction—a formula, a geometrical expression involving four"
5230,"dimensions. Fools, common men, even common mathematicians, do not know"
5230,"anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of"
5230,"molecular physics. In the books—the books that tramp has hidden—there"
5230,"are marvels, miracles! But this was not a method, it was an idea, that"
5230,"might lead to a method by which it would be possible, without changing"
5230,"any other property of matter—except, in some instances colours—to lower"
5230,"the refractive index of a substance, solid or liquid, to that of air—so"
5230,"far as all practical purposes are concerned.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Phew!” said Kemp. “That’s odd! But still I don’t see quite ... I can"
5230,"understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but personal"
5230,"invisibility is a far cry.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Precisely,” said Griffin. “But consider, visibility depends on the"
5230,"action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light, or"
5230,"it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither"
5230,"reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be"
5230,"visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour"
5230,"absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of"
5230,"the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the"
5230,"light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box."
5230,"Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor"
5230,"reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where"
5230,"the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and"
5230,"refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing"
5230,"reflections and translucencies—a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box"
5230,"would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box,"
5230,"because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From"
5230,"certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some"
5230,"kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass"
5230,"would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very"
5230,"thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would"
5230,"absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you"
5230,"put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in"
5230,"some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether,"
5230,"because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or"
5230,"reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a"
5230,"jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same"
5230,"reason!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes,” said Kemp, “that is pretty plain sailing.”"
5230,""
5230,"“And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass"
5230,"is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more"
5230,"visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white"
5230,"powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the"
5230,"glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass"
5230,"there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or"
5230,"refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right"
5230,"through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is put into water,"
5230,"it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass and water have much the same"
5230,"refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction"
5230,"or reflection in passing from one to the other."
5230,""
5230,"“You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the"
5230,"same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is"
5230,"put in any medium of almost the same refractive index. And if you will"
5230,"consider only a second, you will see also that the powder of glass"
5230,"might be made to vanish in air, if its refractive index could be made"
5230,"the same as that of air; for then there would be no refraction or"
5230,"reflection as the light passed from glass to air.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes, yes,” said Kemp. “But a man’s not powdered glass!”"
5230,""
5230,"“No,” said Griffin. “He’s more transparent!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Nonsense!”"
5230,""
5230,"“That from a doctor! How one forgets! Have you already forgotten your"
5230,"physics, in ten years? Just think of all the things that are"
5230,"transparent and seem not to be so. Paper, for instance, is made up of"
5230,"transparent fibres, and it is white and opaque only for the same reason"
5230,"that a powder of glass is white and opaque. Oil white paper, fill up"
5230,"the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no"
5230,"longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces, and it becomes"
5230,"as transparent as glass. And not only paper, but cotton fibre, linen"
5230,"fibre, wool fibre, woody fibre, and _bone_, Kemp, _flesh_, Kemp,"
5230,"_hair_, Kemp, _nails_ and _nerves_, Kemp, in fact the whole fabric of a"
5230,"man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair, are all"
5230,"made up of transparent, colourless tissue. So little suffices to make"
5230,"us visible one to the other. For the most part the fibres of a living"
5230,"creature are no more opaque than water.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Great Heavens!” cried Kemp. “Of course, of course! I was thinking only"
5230,"last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!”"
5230,""
5230,"“_Now_ you have me! And all that I knew and had in mind a year after I"
5230,"left London—six years ago. But I kept it to myself. I had to do my work"
5230,"under frightful disadvantages. Oliver, my professor, was a scientific"
5230,"bounder, a journalist by instinct, a thief of ideas—he was always"
5230,"prying! And you know the knavish system of the scientific world. I"
5230,"simply would not publish, and let him share my credit. I went on"
5230,"working; I got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment,"
5230,"a reality. I told no living soul, because I meant to flash my work upon"
5230,"the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow. I took up"
5230,"the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps. And suddenly, not by"
5230,"design but by accident, I made a discovery in physiology.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes?”"
5230,""
5230,"“You know the red colouring matter of blood; it can be made"
5230,"white—colourless—and remain with all the functions it has now!”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement."
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study. “You may well"
5230,"exclaim. I remember that night. It was late at night—in the daytime one"
5230,"was bothered with the gaping, silly students—and I worked then"
5230,"sometimes till dawn. It came suddenly, splendid and complete in my"
5230,"mind. I was alone; the laboratory was still, with the tall lights"
5230,"burning brightly and silently. In all my great moments I have been"
5230,"alone. ‘One could make an animal—a tissue—transparent! One could make"
5230,"it invisible! All except the pigments—I could be invisible!’ I said,"
5230,"suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge."
5230,"It was overwhelming. I left the filtering I was doing, and went and"
5230,"stared out of the great window at the stars. ‘I could be invisible!’ I"
5230,"repeated."
5230,""
5230,"“To do such a thing would be to transcend magic. And I beheld,"
5230,"unclouded by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might"
5230,"mean to a man—the mystery, the power, the freedom. Drawbacks I saw"
5230,"none. You have only to think! And I, a shabby, poverty-struck,"
5230,"hemmed-in demonstrator, teaching fools in a provincial college, might"
5230,"suddenly become—this. I ask you, Kemp if _you_ ... Anyone, I tell you,"
5230,"would have flung himself upon that research. And I worked three years,"
5230,"and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its"
5230,"summit. The infinite details! And the exasperation! A professor, a"
5230,"provincial professor, always prying. ‘When are you going to publish"
5230,"this work of yours?’ was his everlasting question. And the students,"
5230,"the cramped means! Three years I had of it—"
5230,""
5230,"“And after three years of secrecy and exasperation, I found that to"
5230,"complete it was impossible—impossible.”"
5230,""
5230,"“How?” asked Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Money,” said the Invisible Man, and went again to stare out of the"
5230,"window."
5230,""
5230,"He turned around abruptly. “I robbed the old man—robbed my father."

5230,"AT THE HOUSE IN GREAT PORTLAND STREET"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"For a moment Kemp sat in silence, staring at the back of the headless"
5230,"figure at the window. Then he started, struck by a thought, rose, took"
5230,"the Invisible Man’s arm, and turned him away from the outlook."
5230,""
5230,"“You are tired,” he said, “and while I sit, you walk about. Have my"
5230,"chair.”"
5230,""
5230,"He placed himself between Griffin and the nearest window."
5230,""
5230,"For a space Griffin sat silent, and then he resumed abruptly:"
5230,""
5230,"“I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already,” he said, “when that"
5230,"happened. It was last December. I had taken a room in London, a large"
5230,"unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near"
5230,"Great Portland Street. The room was soon full of the appliances I had"
5230,"bought with his money; the work was going on steadily, successfully,"
5230,"drawing near an end. I was like a man emerging from a thicket, and"
5230,"suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy. I went to bury him. My mind"
5230,"was still on this research, and I did not lift a finger to save his"
5230,"character. I remember the funeral, the cheap hearse, the scant"
5230,"ceremony, the windy frost-bitten hillside, and the old college friend"
5230,"of his who read the service over him—a shabby, black, bent old man with"
5230,"a snivelling cold."
5230,""
5230,"“I remember walking back to the empty house, through the place that had"
5230,"once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry"
5230,"builders into the ugly likeness of a town. Every way the roads ran out"
5230,"at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank"
5230,"wet weeds. I remember myself as a gaunt black figure, going along the"
5230,"slippery, shiny pavement, and the strange sense of detachment I felt"
5230,"from the squalid respectability, the sordid commercialism of the place."
5230,""
5230,"“I did not feel a bit sorry for my father. He seemed to me to be the"
5230,"victim of his own foolish sentimentality. The current cant required my"
5230,"attendance at his funeral, but it was really not my affair."
5230,""
5230,"“But going along the High Street, my old life came back to me for a"
5230,"space, for I met the girl I had known ten years since. Our eyes met."
5230,""
5230,"“Something moved me to turn back and talk to her. She was a very"
5230,"ordinary person."
5230,""
5230,"“It was all like a dream, that visit to the old places. I did not feel"
5230,"then that I was lonely, that I had come out from the world into a"
5230,"desolate place. I appreciated my loss of sympathy, but I put it down to"
5230,"the general inanity of things. Re-entering my room seemed like the"
5230,"recovery of reality. There were the things I knew and loved. There"
5230,"stood the apparatus, the experiments arranged and waiting. And now"
5230,"there was scarcely a difficulty left, beyond the planning of details."
5230,""
5230,"“I will tell you, Kemp, sooner or later, all the complicated processes."
5230,"We need not go into that now. For the most part, saving certain gaps I"
5230,"chose to remember, they are written in cypher in those books that tramp"
5230,"has hidden. We must hunt him down. We must get those books again. But"
5230,"the essential phase was to place the transparent object whose"
5230,"refractive index was to be lowered between two radiating centres of a"
5230,"sort of ethereal vibration, of which I will tell you more fully later."
5230,"No, not those Röntgen vibrations—I don’t know that these others of mine"
5230,"have been described. Yet they are obvious enough. I needed two little"
5230,"dynamos, and these I worked with a cheap gas engine. My first"
5230,"experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric. It was the strangest"
5230,"thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and"
5230,"white, and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish."
5230,""
5230,"“I could scarcely believe I had done it. I put my hand into the"
5230,"emptiness, and there was the thing as solid as ever. I felt it"
5230,"awkwardly, and threw it on the floor. I had a little trouble finding it"
5230,"again."
5230,""
5230,"“And then came a curious experience. I heard a miaow behind me, and"
5230,"turning, saw a lean white cat, very dirty, on the cistern cover outside"
5230,"the window. A thought came into my head. ‘Everything ready for you,’ I"
5230,"said, and went to the window, opened it, and called softly. She came"
5230,"in, purring—the poor beast was starving—and I gave her some milk. All"
5230,"my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room. After that she"
5230,"went smelling round the room, evidently with the idea of making herself"
5230,"at home. The invisible rag upset her a bit; you should have seen her"
5230,"spit at it! But I made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed."
5230,"And I gave her butter to get her to wash.”"
5230,""
5230,"“And you processed her?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I processed her. But giving drugs to a cat is no joke, Kemp! And the"
5230,"process failed.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Failed!”"
5230,""
5230,"“In two particulars. These were the claws and the pigment stuff, what"
5230,"is it?—at the back of the eye in a cat. You know?”"
5230,""
5230,"“_Tapetum_.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes, the _tapetum_. It didn’t go. After I’d given the stuff to bleach"
5230,"the blood and done certain other things to her, I gave the beast opium,"
5230,"and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on, on the apparatus. And"
5230,"after all the rest had faded and vanished, there remained two little"
5230,"ghosts of her eyes.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Odd!”"
5230,""
5230,"“I can’t explain it. She was bandaged and clamped, of course—so I had"
5230,"her safe; but she woke while she was still misty, and miaowed dismally,"
5230,"and someone came knocking. It was an old woman from downstairs, who"
5230,"suspected me of vivisecting—a drink-sodden old creature, with only a"
5230,"white cat to care for in all the world. I whipped out some chloroform,"
5230,"applied it, and answered the door. ‘Did I hear a cat?’ she asked. ‘My"
5230,"cat?’ ‘Not here,’ said I, very politely. She was a little doubtful and"
5230,"tried to peer past me into the room; strange enough to her no"
5230,"doubt—bare walls, uncurtained windows, truckle-bed, with the gas engine"
5230,"vibrating, and the seethe of the radiant points, and that faint ghastly"
5230,"stinging of chloroform in the air. She had to be satisfied at last and"
5230,"went away again.”"
5230,""
5230,"“How long did it take?” asked Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Three or four hours—the cat. The bones and sinews and the fat were the"
5230,"last to go, and the tips of the coloured hairs. And, as I say, the back"
5230,"part of the eye, tough, iridescent stuff it is, wouldn’t go at all."
5230,""
5230,"“It was night outside long before the business was over, and nothing"
5230,"was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws. I stopped the gas"
5230,"engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and"
5230,"then, being tired, left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to"
5230,"bed. I found it hard to sleep. I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff,"
5230,"going over the experiment over and over again, or dreaming feverishly"
5230,"of things growing misty and vanishing about me, until everything, the"
5230,"ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that sickly falling"
5230,"nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began miaowing about the room. I"
5230,"tried to hush it by talking to it, and then I decided to turn it out. I"
5230,"remember the shock I had when striking a light—there were just the"
5230,"round eyes shining green—and nothing round them. I would have given it"
5230,"milk, but I hadn’t any. It wouldn’t be quiet, it just sat down and"
5230,"miaowed at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it"
5230,"out of the window, but it wouldn’t be caught, it vanished. Then it"
5230,"began miaowing in different parts of the room. At last I opened the"
5230,"window and made a bustle. I suppose it went out at last. I never saw"
5230,"any more of it."
5230,""
5230,"“Then—Heaven knows why—I fell thinking of my father’s funeral again,"
5230,"and the dismal windy hillside, until the day had come. I found sleeping"
5230,"was hopeless, and, locking my door after me, wandered out into the"
5230,"morning streets.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You don’t mean to say there’s an invisible cat at large!” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“If it hasn’t been killed,” said the Invisible Man. “Why not?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Why not?” said Kemp. “I didn’t mean to interrupt.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s very probably been killed,” said the Invisible Man. “It was alive"
5230,"four days after, I know, and down a grating in Great Titchfield Street;"
5230,"because I saw a crowd round the place, trying to see whence the"
5230,"miaowing came.”"
5230,""
5230,"He was silent for the best part of a minute. Then he resumed abruptly:"
5230,""
5230,"“I remember that morning before the change very vividly. I must have"
5230,"gone up Great Portland Street. I remember the barracks in Albany"
5230,"Street, and the horse soldiers coming out, and at last I found the"
5230,"summit of Primrose Hill. It was a sunny day in January—one of those"
5230,"sunny, frosty days that came before the snow this year. My weary brain"
5230,"tried to formulate the position, to plot out a plan of action."
5230,""
5230,"“I was surprised to find, now that my prize was within my grasp, how"
5230,"inconclusive its attainment seemed. As a matter of fact I was worked"
5230,"out; the intense stress of nearly four years’ continuous work left me"
5230,"incapable of any strength of feeling. I was apathetic, and I tried in"
5230,"vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries, the passion of"
5230,"discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my"
5230,"father’s grey hairs. Nothing seemed to matter. I saw pretty clearly"
5230,"this was a transient mood, due to overwork and want of sleep, and that"
5230,"either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies."
5230,""
5230,"“All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried"
5230,"through; the fixed idea still ruled me. And soon, for the money I had"
5230,"was almost exhausted. I looked about me at the hillside, with children"
5230,"playing and girls watching them, and tried to think of all the"
5230,"fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world. After a"
5230,"time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of strychnine,"
5230,"and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed. Strychnine is a grand"
5230,"tonic, Kemp, to take the flabbiness out of a man.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It’s the devil,” said Kemp. “It’s the palaeolithic in a bottle.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable. You know?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I know the stuff.”"
5230,""
5230,"“And there was someone rapping at the door. It was my landlord with"
5230,"threats and inquiries, an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy"
5230,"slippers. I had been tormenting a cat in the night, he was sure—the old"
5230,"woman’s tongue had been busy. He insisted on knowing all about it. The"
5230,"laws in this country against vivisection were very severe—he might be"
5230,"liable. I denied the cat. Then the vibration of the little gas engine"
5230,"could be felt all over the house, he said. That was true, certainly. He"
5230,"edged round me into the room, peering about over his German-silver"
5230,"spectacles, and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry"
5230,"away something of my secret. I tried to keep between him and the"
5230,"concentrating apparatus I had arranged, and that only made him more"
5230,"curious. What was I doing? Why was I always alone and secretive? Was it"
5230,"legal? Was it dangerous? I paid nothing but the usual rent. His had"
5230,"always been a most respectable house—in a disreputable neighbourhood."
5230,"Suddenly my temper gave way. I told him to get out. He began to"
5230,"protest, to jabber of his right of entry. In a moment I had him by the"
5230,"collar; something ripped, and he went spinning out into his own"
5230,"passage. I slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering."
5230,""
5230,"“He made a fuss outside, which I disregarded, and after a time he went"
5230,"away."
5230,""
5230,"“But this brought matters to a crisis. I did not know what he would do,"
5230,"nor even what he had the power to do. To move to fresh apartments would"
5230,"have meant delay; altogether I had barely twenty pounds left in the"
5230,"world, for the most part in a bank—and I could not afford that. Vanish!"
5230,"It was irresistible. Then there would be an inquiry, the sacking of my"
5230,"room."
5230,""
5230,"“At the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or"
5230,"interrupted at its very climax, I became very angry and active. I"
5230,"hurried out with my three books of notes, my cheque-book—the tramp has"
5230,"them now—and directed them from the nearest Post Office to a house of"
5230,"call for letters and parcels in Great Portland Street. I tried to go"
5230,"out noiselessly. Coming in, I found my landlord going quietly upstairs;"
5230,"he had heard the door close, I suppose. You would have laughed to see"
5230,"him jump aside on the landing as I came tearing after him. He glared at"
5230,"me as I went by him, and I made the house quiver with the slamming of"
5230,"my door. I heard him come shuffling up to my floor, hesitate, and go"
5230,"down. I set to work upon my preparations forthwith."
5230,""
5230,"“It was all done that evening and night. While I was still sitting"
5230,"under the sickly, drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood,"
5230,"there came a repeated knocking at the door. It ceased, footsteps went"
5230,"away and returned, and the knocking was resumed. There was an attempt"
5230,"to push something under the door—a blue paper. Then in a fit of"
5230,"irritation I rose and went and flung the door wide open. ‘Now then?’"
5230,"said I."
5230,""
5230,"“It was my landlord, with a notice of ejectment or something. He held"
5230,"it out to me, saw something odd about my hands, I expect, and lifted"
5230,"his eyes to my face."
5230,""
5230,"“For a moment he gaped. Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry,"
5230,"dropped candle and writ together, and went blundering down the dark"
5230,"passage to the stairs. I shut the door, locked it, and went to the"
5230,"looking-glass. Then I understood his terror.... My face was white—like"
5230,"white stone."
5230,""
5230,"“But it was all horrible. I had not expected the suffering. A night of"
5230,"racking anguish, sickness and fainting. I set my teeth, though my skin"
5230,"was presently afire, all my body afire; but I lay there like grim"
5230,"death. I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I"
5230,"chloroformed it. Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room."
5230,"There were times when I sobbed and groaned and talked. But I stuck to"
5230,"it.... I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness."
5230,""
5230,"“The pain had passed. I thought I was killing myself and I did not"
5230,"care. I shall never forget that dawn, and the strange horror of seeing"
5230,"that my hands had become as clouded glass, and watching them grow"
5230,"clearer and thinner as the day went by, until at last I could see the"
5230,"sickly disorder of my room through them, though I closed my transparent"
5230,"eyelids. My limbs became glassy, the bones and arteries faded,"
5230,"vanished, and the little white nerves went last. I gritted my teeth and"
5230,"stayed there to the end. At last only the dead tips of the fingernails"
5230,"remained, pallid and white, and the brown stain of some acid upon my"
5230,"fingers."
5230,""
5230,"“I struggled up. At first I was as incapable as a swathed"
5230,"infant—stepping with limbs I could not see. I was weak and very hungry."
5230,"I went and stared at nothing in my shaving-glass, at nothing save where"
5230,"an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes,"
5230,"fainter than mist. I had to hang on to the table and press my forehead"
5230,"against the glass."
5230,""
5230,"“It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back to"
5230,"the apparatus and completed the process."
5230,""
5230,"“I slept during the forenoon, pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut"
5230,"out the light, and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking. My"
5230,"strength had returned. I sat up and listened and heard a whispering. I"
5230,"sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the"
5230,"connections of my apparatus, and to distribute it about the room, so as"
5230,"to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement. Presently the knocking"
5230,"was renewed and voices called, first my landlord’s, and then two"
5230,"others. To gain time I answered them. The invisible rag and pillow came"
5230,"to hand and I opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern"
5230,"cover. As the window opened, a heavy crash came at the door. Someone"
5230,"had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock. But the stout bolts"
5230,"I had screwed up some days before stopped him. That startled me, made"
5230,"me angry. I began to tremble and do things hurriedly."
5230,""
5230,"“I tossed together some loose paper, straw, packing paper and so forth,"
5230,"in the middle of the room, and turned on the gas. Heavy blows began to"
5230,"rain upon the door. I could not find the matches. I beat my hands on"
5230,"the wall with rage. I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the"
5230,"window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat"
5230,"down, secure and invisible, but quivering with anger, to watch events."
5230,"They split a panel, I saw, and in another moment they had broken away"
5230,"the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway. It was the"
5230,"landlord and his two step-sons, sturdy young men of three or four and"
5230,"twenty. Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs."
5230,""
5230,"“You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty. One of the"
5230,"younger men rushed to the window at once, flung it up and stared out."
5230,"His staring eyes and thick-lipped bearded face came a foot from my"
5230,"face. I was half minded to hit his silly countenance, but I arrested my"
5230,"doubled fist. He stared right through me. So did the others as they"
5230,"joined him. The old man went and peered under the bed, and then they"
5230,"all made a rush for the cupboard. They had to argue about it at length"
5230,"in Yiddish and Cockney English. They concluded I had not answered them,"
5230,"that their imagination had deceived them. A feeling of extraordinary"
5230,"elation took the place of my anger as I sat outside the window and"
5230,"watched these four people—for the old lady came in, glancing"
5230,"suspiciously about her like a cat, trying to understand the riddle of"
5230,"my behaviour."
5230,""
5230,"“The old man, so far as I could understand his _patois_, agreed with"
5230,"the old lady that I was a vivisectionist. The sons protested in garbled"
5230,"English that I was an electrician, and appealed to the dynamos and"
5230,"radiators. They were all nervous about my arrival, although I found"
5230,"subsequently that they had bolted the front door. The old lady peered"
5230,"into the cupboard and under the bed, and one of the young men pushed up"
5230,"the register and stared up the chimney. One of my fellow lodgers, a"
5230,"coster-monger who shared the opposite room with a butcher, appeared on"
5230,"the landing, and he was called in and told incoherent things."
5230,""
5230,"“It occurred to me that the radiators, if they fell into the hands of"
5230,"some acute well-educated person, would give me away too much, and"
5230,"watching my opportunity, I came into the room and tilted one of the"
5230,"little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing, and smashed"
5230,"both apparatus. Then, while they were trying to explain the smash, I"
5230,"dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs."
5230,""
5230,"“I went into one of the sitting-rooms and waited until they came down,"
5230,"still speculating and argumentative, all a little disappointed at"
5230,"finding no ‘horrors,’ and all a little puzzled how they stood legally"
5230,"towards me. Then I slipped up again with a box of matches, fired my"
5230,"heap of paper and rubbish, put the chairs and bedding thereby, led the"
5230,"gas to the affair, by means of an india-rubber tube, and waving a"
5230,"farewell to the room left it for the last time.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You fired the house!” exclaimed Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Fired the house. It was the only way to cover my trail—and no doubt it"
5230,"was insured. I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out"
5230,"into the street. I was invisible, and I was only just beginning to"
5230,"realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me. My head"
5230,"was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things I"
5230,"had now impunity to do.”"

5230,"IN OXFORD STREET"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"“In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty"
5230,"because I could not see my feet; indeed I stumbled twice, and there was"
5230,"an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt. By not looking down,"
5230,"however, I managed to walk on the level passably well."
5230,""
5230,"“My mood, I say, was one of exaltation. I felt as a seeing man might"
5230,"do, with padded feet and noiseless clothes, in a city of the blind. I"
5230,"experienced a wild impulse to jest, to startle people, to clap men on"
5230,"the back, fling people’s hats astray, and generally revel in my"
5230,"extraordinary advantage."
5230,""
5230,"“But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street, however (my"
5230,"lodging was close to the big draper’s shop there), when I heard a"
5230,"clashing concussion and was hit violently behind, and turning saw a man"
5230,"carrying a basket of soda-water syphons, and looking in amazement at"
5230,"his burden. Although the blow had really hurt me, I found something so"
5230,"irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed aloud. ‘The devil’s in"
5230,"the basket,’ I said, and suddenly twisted it out of his hand. He let go"
5230,"incontinently, and I swung the whole weight into the air."
5230,""
5230,"“But a fool of a cabman, standing outside a public house, made a sudden"
5230,"rush for this, and his extending fingers took me with excruciating"
5230,"violence under the ear. I let the whole down with a smash on the"
5230,"cabman, and then, with shouts and the clatter of feet about me, people"
5230,"coming out of shops, vehicles pulling up, I realised what I had done"
5230,"for myself, and cursing my folly, backed against a shop window and"
5230,"prepared to dodge out of the confusion. In a moment I should be wedged"
5230,"into a crowd and inevitably discovered. I pushed by a butcher boy, who"
5230,"luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside, and"
5230,"dodged behind the cab-man’s four-wheeler. I do not know how they"
5230,"settled the business. I hurried straight across the road, which was"
5230,"happily clear, and hardly heeding which way I went, in the fright of"
5230,"detection the incident had given me, plunged into the afternoon throng"
5230,"of Oxford Street."
5230,""
5230,"“I tried to get into the stream of people, but they were too thick for"
5230,"me, and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon. I took to the"
5230,"gutter, the roughness of which I found painful to my feet, and"
5230,"forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the"
5230,"shoulder blade, reminding me that I was already bruised severely. I"
5230,"staggered out of the way of the cab, avoided a perambulator by a"
5230,"convulsive movement, and found myself behind the hansom. A happy"
5230,"thought saved me, and as this drove slowly along I followed in its"
5230,"immediate wake, trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure."
5230,"And not only trembling, but shivering. It was a bright day in January"
5230,"and I was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road"
5230,"was freezing. Foolish as it seems to me now, I had not reckoned that,"
5230,"transparent or not, I was still amenable to the weather and all its"
5230,"consequences."
5230,""
5230,"“Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head. I ran round and got"
5230,"into the cab. And so, shivering, scared, and sniffing with the first"
5230,"intimations of a cold, and with the bruises in the small of my back"
5230,"growing upon my attention, I drove slowly along Oxford Street and past"
5230,"Tottenham Court Road. My mood was as different from that in which I had"
5230,"sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine. This"
5230,"invisibility indeed! The one thought that possessed me was—how was I to"
5230,"get out of the scrape I was in."
5230,""
5230,"“We crawled past Mudie’s, and there a tall woman with five or six"
5230,"yellow-labelled books hailed my cab, and I sprang out just in time to"
5230,"escape her, shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight. I made off up"
5230,"the roadway to Bloomsbury Square, intending to strike north past the"
5230,"Museum and so get into the quiet district. I was now cruelly chilled,"
5230,"and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that I whimpered as"
5230,"I ran. At the northward corner of the Square a little white dog ran out"
5230,"of the Pharmaceutical Society’s offices, and incontinently made for me,"
5230,"nose down."
5230,""
5230,"“I had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a dog"
5230,"what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man. Dogs perceive the scent of"
5230,"a man moving as men perceive his vision. This brute began barking and"
5230,"leaping, showing, as it seemed to me, only too plainly that he was"
5230,"aware of me. I crossed Great Russell Street, glancing over my shoulder"
5230,"as I did so, and went some way along Montague Street before I realised"
5230,"what I was running towards."
5230,""
5230,"“Then I became aware of a blare of music, and looking along the street"
5230,"saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square, red shirts, and"
5230,"the banner of the Salvation Army to the fore. Such a crowd, chanting in"
5230,"the roadway and scoffing on the pavement, I could not hope to"
5230,"penetrate, and dreading to go back and farther from home again, and"
5230,"deciding on the spur of the moment, I ran up the white steps of a house"
5230,"facing the museum railings, and stood there until the crowd should have"
5230,"passed. Happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too,"
5230,"hesitated, and turned tail, running back to Bloomsbury Square again."
5230,""
5230,"“On came the band, bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about ‘When"
5230,"shall we see His face?’ and it seemed an interminable time to me before"
5230,"the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me. Thud, thud,"
5230,"thud, came the drum with a vibrating resonance, and for the moment I"
5230,"did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me. ‘See ’em,’"
5230,"said one. ‘See what?’ said the other. ‘Why—them footmarks—bare. Like"
5230,"what you makes in mud.’"
5230,""
5230,"“I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at"
5230,"the muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened steps."
5230,"The passing people elbowed and jostled them, but their confounded"
5230,"intelligence was arrested. ‘Thud, thud, thud, when, thud, shall we see,"
5230,"thud, his face, thud, thud.’ ‘There’s a barefoot man gone up them"
5230,"steps, or I don’t know nothing,’ said one. ‘And he ain’t never come"

5230,""
5230,"“The thick of the crowd had already passed. ‘Looky there, Ted,’ quoth"
5230,"the younger of the detectives, with the sharpness of surprise in his"
5230,"voice, and pointed straight to my feet. I looked down and saw at once"
5230,"the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud. For a"
5230,"moment I was paralysed."
5230,""
5230,"“‘Why, that’s rum,’ said the elder. ‘Dashed rum! It’s just like the"
5230,"ghost of a foot, ain’t it?’ He hesitated and advanced with outstretched"
5230,"hand. A man pulled up short to see what he was catching, and then a"
5230,"girl. In another moment he would have touched me. Then I saw what to"
5230,"do. I made a step, the boy started back with an exclamation, and with a"
5230,"rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house."
5230,"But the smaller boy was sharp-eyed enough to follow the movement, and"
5230,"before I was well down the steps and upon the pavement, he had"
5230,"recovered from his momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the"
5230,"feet had gone over the wall."

5230,"“They rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the"
5230,"lower step and upon the pavement. ‘What’s up?’ asked someone. ‘Feet!"
5230,"Look! Feet running!’"

5230,"“Everybody in the road, except my three pursuers, was pouring along"
5230,"after the Salvation Army, and this blow not only impeded me but them."
5230,"There was an eddy of surprise and interrogation. At the cost of bowling"
5230,"over one young fellow I got through, and in another moment I was"
5230,"rushing headlong round the circuit of Russell Square, with six or seven"
5230,"astonished people following my footmarks. There was no time for"
5230,"explanation, or else the whole host would have been after me."
5230,""
5230,"“Twice I doubled round corners, thrice I crossed the road and came back"
5230,"upon my tracks, and then, as my feet grew hot and dry, the damp"
5230,"impressions began to fade. At last I had a breathing space and rubbed"
5230,"my feet clean with my hands, and so got away altogether. The last I saw"
5230,"of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps, studying"
5230,"with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted"
5230,"from a puddle in Tavistock Square, a footprint as isolated and"
5230,"incomprehensible to them as Crusoe’s solitary discovery."
5230,""
5230,"“This running warmed me to a certain extent, and I went on with a"
5230,"better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs"
5230,"hereabouts. My back had now become very stiff and sore, my tonsils were"
5230,"painful from the cabman’s fingers, and the skin of my neck had been"
5230,"scratched by his nails; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a"
5230,"little cut on one foot. I saw in time a blind man approaching me, and"
5230,"fled limping, for I feared his subtle intuitions. Once or twice"
5230,"accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed, with"
5230,"unaccountable curses ringing in their ears. Then came something silent"
5230,"and quiet against my face, and across the Square fell a thin veil of"
5230,"slowly falling flakes of snow. I had caught a cold, and do as I would I"
5230,"could not avoid an occasional sneeze. And every dog that came in sight,"
5230,"with its pointing nose and curious sniffing, was a terror to me."
5230,""
5230,"“Then came men and boys running, first one and then others, and"
5230,"shouting as they ran. It was a fire. They ran in the direction of my"
5230,"lodging, and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke"
5230,"streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires. It was my lodging"
5230,"burning; my clothes, my apparatus, all my resources indeed, except my"
5230,"cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great"
5230,"Portland Street, were there. Burning! I had burnt my boats—if ever a"

5230,"inexpressibly wretched, and still but half convinced of my invisible"
5230,"quality, I began this new life to which I am committed. I had no"

5230,"passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy. But I knew too clearly the"
5230,"terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke. I made no plans in"
5230,"the street. My sole object was to get shelter from the snow, to get"
5230,"myself covered and warm; then I might hope to plan. But even to me, an"

5230,"outside Omniums, the big establishment where everything is to be"
5230,"bought—you know the place: meat, grocery, linen, furniture, clothing,"
5230,"oil paintings even—a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a"
5230,"shop. I had thought I should find the doors open, but they were closed,"
5230,"and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside, and a"
5230,"man in uniform—you know the kind of personage with ‘Omnium’ on his"
5230,"cap—flung open the door. I contrived to enter, and walking down the"
5230,"shop—it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and"
5230,"stockings and that kind of thing—came to a more spacious region devoted"
5230,"to picnic baskets and wicker furniture."
5230,""
5230,"“I did not feel safe there, however; people were going to and fro, and"
5230,"I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper"
5230,"floor containing multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I clambered,"
5230,"and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile of folded flock"
5230,"mattresses. The place was already lit up and agreeably warm, and I"
5230,"decided to remain where I was, keeping a cautious eye on the two or"
5230,"three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the"
5230,"place, until closing time came. Then I should be able, I thought, to"
5230,"rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl through it"
5230,"and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding. That"
5230,"seemed an acceptable plan. My idea was to procure clothing to make"
5230,"myself a muffled but acceptable figure, to get money, and then to"
5230,"recover my books and parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging"
5230,"somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the"
5230,"advantages my invisibility gave me (as I still imagined) over my"
5230,"fellow-men."
5230,""
5230,"“Closing time arrived quickly enough. It could not have been more than"
5230,"an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed"
5230,"the blinds of the windows being drawn, and customers being marched"
5230,"doorward. And then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable"
5230,"alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed. I left my lair"
5230,"as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out into the less"
5230,"desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised to observe how"
5230,"rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for"
5230,"sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the hanging fabrics, the"
5230,"festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the grocery section, the"
5230,"displays of this and that, were being whipped down, folded up, slapped"
5230,"into tidy receptacles, and everything that could not be taken down and"
5230,"put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them."
5230,"Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters, leaving the"
5230,"floor clear. Directly each of these young people had done, he or she"
5230,"made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I"
5230,"have rarely observed in a shop assistant before. Then came a lot of"
5230,"youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms. I had to"
5230,"dodge to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung with the"
5230,"sawdust. For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened"
5230,"departments, I could hear the brooms at work. And at last a good hour"
5230,"or more after the shop had been closed, came a noise of locking doors."
5230,"Silence came upon the place, and I found myself wandering through the"
5230,"vast and intricate shops, galleries, show-rooms of the place, alone. It"
5230,"was very still; in one place I remember passing near one of the"
5230,"Tottenham Court Road entrances and listening to the tapping of"
5230,"boot-heels of the passers-by."
5230,""
5230,"“My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and gloves"
5230,"for sale. It was dark, and I had the devil of a hunt after matches,"
5230,"which I found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk. Then I had"
5230,"to get a candle. I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of"
5230,"boxes and drawers, but at last I managed to turn out what I sought; the"
5230,"box label called them lambswool pants, and lambswool vests. Then socks,"
5230,"a thick comforter, and then I went to the clothing place and got"
5230,"trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat and a slouch hat—a clerical sort"
5230,"of hat with the brim turned down. I began to feel a human being again,"
5230,"and my next thought was food."
5230,""
5230,"“Upstairs was a refreshment department, and there I got cold meat."
5230,"There was coffee still in the urn, and I lit the gas and warmed it up"
5230,"again, and altogether I did not do badly. Afterwards, prowling through"
5230,"the place in search of blankets—I had to put up at last with a heap of"
5230,"down quilts—I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and"
5230,"candied fruits, more than was good for me indeed—and some white"
5230,"burgundy. And near that was a toy department, and I had a brilliant"
5230,"idea. I found some artificial noses—dummy noses, you know, and I"
5230,"thought of dark spectacles. But Omniums had no optical department. My"
5230,"nose had been a difficulty indeed—I had thought of paint. But the"
5230,"discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like. Finally I"
5230,"went to sleep in a heap of down quilts, very warm and comfortable."
5230,""
5230,"“My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had"
5230,"since the change. I was in a state of physical serenity, and that was"
5230,"reflected in my mind. I thought that I should be able to slip out"
5230,"unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me, muffling my face"
5230,"with a white wrapper I had taken, purchase, with the money I had taken,"
5230,"spectacles and so forth, and so complete my disguise. I lapsed into"
5230,"disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during"
5230,"the last few days. I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating"
5230,"in his rooms; I saw his two sons marvelling, and the wrinkled old"
5230,"woman’s gnarled face as she asked for her cat. I experienced again the"
5230,"strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear, and so I came round to"
5230,"the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling ‘Earth to"
5230,"earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,’ at my father’s open grave."
5230,""
5230,"“‘You also,’ said a voice, and suddenly I was being forced towards the"
5230,"grave. I struggled, shouted, appealed to the mourners, but they"
5230,"continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too, never"
5230,"faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual. I realised I was"
5230,"invisible and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their grip on me."
5230,"I struggled in vain, I was forced over the brink, the coffin rang"
5230,"hollow as I fell upon it, and the gravel came flying after me in"
5230,"spadefuls. Nobody heeded me, nobody was aware of me. I made convulsive"
5230,"struggles and awoke."
5230,""
5230,"“The pale London dawn had come, the place was full of a chilly grey"
5230,"light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds. I sat up, and"
5230,"for a time I could not think where this ample apartment, with its"
5230,"counters, its piles of rolled stuff, its heap of quilts and cushions,"
5230,"its iron pillars, might be. Then, as recollection came back to me, I"
5230,"heard voices in conversation."
5230,""
5230,"“Then far down the place, in the brighter light of some department"
5230,"which had already raised its blinds, I saw two men approaching. I"
5230,"scrambled to my feet, looking about me for some way of escape, and even"
5230,"as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me. I suppose"
5230,"they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away. ‘Who’s that?’"
5230,"cried one, and ‘Stop there!’ shouted the other. I dashed around a"
5230,"corner and came full tilt—a faceless figure, mind you!—on a lanky lad"
5230,"of fifteen. He yelled and I bowled him over, rushed past him, turned"
5230,"another corner, and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a"
5230,"counter. In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices"
5230,"shouting, ‘All hands to the doors!’ asking what was ‘up,’ and giving"
5230,"one another advice how to catch me."
5230,""
5230,"“Lying on the ground, I felt scared out of my wits. But—odd as it may"
5230,"seem—it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I"
5230,"should have done. I had made up my mind, I suppose, to get away in"
5230,"them, and that ruled me. And then down the vista of the counters came a"
5230,"bawling of ‘Here he is!’"
5230,""
5230,"“I sprang to my feet, whipped a chair off the counter, and sent it"
5230,"whirling at the fool who had shouted, turned, came into another round a"
5230,"corner, sent him spinning, and rushed up the stairs. He kept his"
5230,"footing, gave a view hallo, and came up the staircase hot after me. Up"
5230,"the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright-coloured pot"
5230,"things—what are they?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Art pots,” suggested Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“That’s it! Art pots. Well, I turned at the top step and swung round,"
5230,"plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came"
5230,"at me. The whole pile of pots went headlong, and I heard shouting and"
5230,"footsteps running from all parts. I made a mad rush for the refreshment"
5230,"place, and there was a man in white like a man cook, who took up the"
5230,"chase. I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and"
5230,"ironmongery. I went behind the counter of this, and waited for my cook,"
5230,"and as he bolted in at the head of the chase, I doubled him up with a"
5230,"lamp. Down he went, and I crouched down behind the counter and began"
5230,"whipping off my clothes as fast as I could. Coat, jacket, trousers,"
5230,"shoes were all right, but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin. I"
5230,"heard more men coming, my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the"
5230,"counter, stunned or scared speechless, and I had to make another dash"
5230,"for it, like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile."
5230,""
5230,"“‘This way, policeman!’ I heard someone shouting. I found myself in my"
5230,"bedstead storeroom again, and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes."
5230,"I rushed among them, went flat, got rid of my vest after infinite"
5230,"wriggling, and stood a free man again, panting and scared, as the"
5230,"policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner. They made a"
5230,"rush for the vest and pants, and collared the trousers. ‘He’s dropping"
5230,"his plunder,’ said one of the young men. ‘He _must_ be somewhere here.’"
5230,""
5230,"“But they did not find me all the same."
5230,""
5230,"“I stood watching them hunt for me for a time, and cursing my ill-luck"
5230,"in losing the clothes. Then I went into the refreshment-room, drank a"
5230,"little milk I found there, and sat down by the fire to consider my"
5230,"position."
5230,""
5230,"“In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the"
5230,"business very excitedly and like the fools they were. I heard a"
5230,"magnified account of my depredations, and other speculations as to my"
5230,"whereabouts. Then I fell to scheming again. The insurmountable"
5230,"difficulty of the place, especially now it was alarmed, was to get any"
5230,"plunder out of it. I went down into the warehouse to see if there was"
5230,"any chance of packing and addressing a parcel, but I could not"
5230,"understand the system of checking. About eleven o’clock, the snow"
5230,"having thawed as it fell, and the day being finer and a little warmer"
5230,"than the previous one, I decided that the Emporium was hopeless, and"
5230,"went out again, exasperated at my want of success, with only the"
5230,"vaguest plans of action in my mind.”"

5230,"CHAPTER XXIII."
5230,"IN DRURY LANE"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"“But you begin now to realise,” said the Invisible Man, “the full"
5230,"disadvantage of my condition. I had no shelter—no covering—to get"
5230,"clothing was to forego all my advantage, to make myself a strange and"
5230,"terrible thing. I was fasting; for to eat, to fill myself with"
5230,"unassimilated matter, would be to become grotesquely visible again.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I never thought of that,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers. I could not go"
5230,"abroad in snow—it would settle on me and expose me. Rain, too, would"
5230,"make me a watery outline, a glistening surface of a man—a bubble. And"
5230,"fog—I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog, a surface, a greasy"
5230,"glimmer of humanity. Moreover, as I went abroad—in the London air—I"
5230,"gathered dirt about my ankles, floating smuts and dust upon my skin. I"
5230,"did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from"
5230,"that cause also. But I saw clearly it could not be for long."
5230,""
5230,"“Not in London at any rate."
5230,""
5230,"“I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street, and found myself"
5230,"at the end of the street in which I had lodged. I did not go that way,"
5230,"because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking"
5230,"ruins of the house I had fired. My most immediate problem was to get"
5230,"clothing. What to do with my face puzzled me. Then I saw in one of"
5230,"those little miscellaneous shops—news, sweets, toys, stationery,"
5230,"belated Christmas tomfoolery, and so forth—an array of masks and noses."
5230,"I realised that problem was solved. In a flash I saw my course. I"
5230,"turned about, no longer aimless, and went—circuitously in order to"
5230,"avoid the busy ways, towards the back streets north of the Strand; for"
5230,"I remembered, though not very distinctly where, that some theatrical"
5230,"costumiers had shops in that district."
5230,""
5230,"“The day was cold, with a nipping wind down the northward running"
5230,"streets. I walked fast to avoid being overtaken. Every crossing was a"
5230,"danger, every passenger a thing to watch alertly. One man as I was"
5230,"about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street, turned upon me abruptly"
5230,"and came into me, sending me into the road and almost under the wheel"
5230,"of a passing hansom. The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had"
5230,"some sort of stroke. I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went"
5230,"into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner"
5230,"by a stall of violets, panting and trembling. I found I had caught a"
5230,"fresh cold, and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should"
5230,"attract attention."
5230,""
5230,"“At last I reached the object of my quest, a dirty, fly-blown little"
5230,"shop in a by-way near Drury Lane, with a window full of tinsel robes,"
5230,"sham jewels, wigs, slippers, dominoes and theatrical photographs. The"
5230,"shop was old-fashioned and low and dark, and the house rose above it"
5230,"for four storeys, dark and dismal. I peered through the window and,"
5230,"seeing no one within, entered. The opening of the door set a clanking"
5230,"bell ringing. I left it open, and walked round a bare costume stand,"
5230,"into a corner behind a cheval glass. For a minute or so no one came."
5230,"Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room, and a man appeared down"
5230,"the shop."
5230,""
5230,"“My plans were now perfectly definite. I proposed to make my way into"
5230,"the house, secrete myself upstairs, watch my opportunity, and when"
5230,"everything was quiet, rummage out a wig, mask, spectacles, and costume,"
5230,"and go into the world, perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure."
5230,"And incidentally of course I could rob the house of any available"
5230,"money."
5230,""
5230,"“The man who had just entered the shop was a short, slight, hunched,"
5230,"beetle-browed man, with long arms and very short bandy legs. Apparently"
5230,"I had interrupted a meal. He stared about the shop with an expression"
5230,"of expectation. This gave way to surprise, and then to anger, as he saw"
5230,"the shop empty. ‘Damn the boys!’ he said. He went to stare up and down"
5230,"the street. He came in again in a minute, kicked the door to with his"
5230,"foot spitefully, and went muttering back to the house door."
5230,""
5230,"“I came forward to follow him, and at the noise of my movement he"
5230,"stopped dead. I did so too, startled by his quickness of ear. He"
5230,"slammed the house door in my face."
5230,""
5230,"“I stood hesitating. Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning,"
5230,"and the door reopened. He stood looking about the shop like one who was"
5230,"still not satisfied. Then, murmuring to himself, he examined the back"
5230,"of the counter and peered behind some fixtures. Then he stood doubtful."
5230,"He had left the house door open and I slipped into the inner room."
5230,""
5230,"“It was a queer little room, poorly furnished and with a number of big"
5230,"masks in the corner. On the table was his belated breakfast, and it was"
5230,"a confoundedly exasperating thing for me, Kemp, to have to sniff his"
5230,"coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal. And"
5230,"his table manners were irritating. Three doors opened into the little"
5230,"room, one going upstairs and one down, but they were all shut. I could"
5230,"not get out of the room while he was there; I could scarcely move"
5230,"because of his alertness, and there was a draught down my back. Twice I"
5230,"strangled a sneeze just in time."
5230,""
5230,"“The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel, but"
5230,"for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his"
5230,"eating. But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on"
5230,"the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot, and gathering all"
5230,"the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth, he took the whole lot of"
5230,"things after him. His burden prevented his shutting the door behind"
5230,"him—as he would have done; I never saw such a man for shutting"
5230,"doors—and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and"
5230,"scullery. I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up, and then,"
5230,"finding no good in keeping down there, and the brick floor being cold"
5230,"on my feet, I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire. It"
5230,"was burning low, and scarcely thinking, I put on a little coal. The"
5230,"noise of this brought him up at once, and he stood aglare. He peered"
5230,"about the room and was within an ace of touching me. Even after that"
5230,"examination, he scarcely seemed satisfied. He stopped in the doorway"
5230,"and took a final inspection before he went down."
5230,""
5230,"“I waited in the little parlour for an age, and at last he came up and"
5230,"opened the upstairs door. I just managed to get by him."
5230,""
5230,"“On the staircase he stopped suddenly, so that I very nearly blundered"
5230,"into him. He stood looking back right into my face and listening. ‘I"
5230,"could have sworn,’ he said. His long hairy hand pulled at his lower"
5230,"lip. His eye went up and down the staircase. Then he grunted and went"
5230,"on up again."
5230,""
5230,"“His hand was on the handle of a door, and then he stopped again with"
5230,"the same puzzled anger on his face. He was becoming aware of the faint"
5230,"sounds of my movements about him. The man must have had diabolically"
5230,"acute hearing. He suddenly flashed into rage. ‘If there’s anyone in"
5230,"this house—’ he cried with an oath, and left the threat unfinished. He"
5230,"put his hand in his pocket, failed to find what he wanted, and rushing"
5230,"past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs. But I did"
5230,"not follow him. I sat on the head of the staircase until his return."
5230,""
5230,"“Presently he came up again, still muttering. He opened the door of the"
5230,"room, and before I could enter, slammed it in my face."
5230,""
5230,"“I resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so as"
5230,"noiselessly as possible. The house was very old and tumble-down, damp"
5230,"so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls, and rat"
5230,"infested. Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn"
5230,"them. Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished, and others were"
5230,"littered with theatrical lumber, bought second-hand, I judged, from its"
5230,"appearance. In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes. I"
5230,"began routing among these, and in my eagerness forgot again the evident"
5230,"sharpness of his ears. I heard a stealthy footstep and, looking up just"
5230,"in time, saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an"
5230,"old-fashioned revolver in his hand. I stood perfectly still while he"
5230,"stared about open-mouthed and suspicious. ‘It must have been her,’ he"
5230,"said slowly. ‘Damn her!’"
5230,""
5230,"“He shut the door quietly, and immediately I heard the key turn in the"
5230,"lock. Then his footsteps retreated. I realised abruptly that I was"
5230,"locked in. For a minute I did not know what to do. I walked from door"
5230,"to window and back, and stood perplexed. A gust of anger came upon me."
5230,"But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further, and"
5230,"my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf. This brought"
5230,"him back, more sinister than ever. That time he actually touched me,"
5230,"jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the"
5230,"room."
5230,""
5230,"“Presently he calmed a little. ‘Rats,’ he said in an undertone, fingers"
5230,"on lips. He was evidently a little scared. I edged quietly out of the"
5230,"room, but a plank creaked. Then the infernal little brute started going"
5230,"all over the house, revolver in hand and locking door after door and"
5230,"pocketing the keys. When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of"
5230,"rage—I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my"
5230,"opportunity. By this time I knew he was alone in the house, and so I"
5230,"made no more ado, but knocked him on the head.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Knocked him on the head?” exclaimed Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Yes—stunned him—as he was going downstairs. Hit him from behind with a"
5230,"stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs like a bag of old"
5230,"boots.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But—I say! The common conventions of humanity—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Are all very well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I"
5230,"had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me. I"
5230,"couldn’t think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with"
5230,"a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Tied him up in a sheet!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Made a sort of bag of it. It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot"
5230,"scared and quiet, and a devilish hard thing to get out of—head away"
5230,"from the string. My dear Kemp, it’s no good your sitting glaring as"
5230,"though I was a murderer. It had to be done. He had his revolver. If"
5230,"once he saw me he would be able to describe me—”"
5230,""
5230,"“But still,” said Kemp, “in England—to-day. And the man was in his own"
5230,"house, and you were—well, robbing.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Robbing! Confound it! You’ll call me a thief next! Surely, Kemp,"
5230,"you’re not fool enough to dance on the old strings. Can’t you see my"
5230,"position?”"
5230,""
5230,"“And his too,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man stood up sharply. “What do you mean to say?”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp’s face grew a trifle hard. He was about to speak and checked"
5230,"himself. “I suppose, after all,” he said with a sudden change of"
5230,"manner, “the thing had to be done. You were in a fix. But still—”"
5230,""
5230,"“Of course I was in a fix—an infernal fix. And he made me wild"
5230,"too—hunting me about the house, fooling about with his revolver,"
5230,"locking and unlocking doors. He was simply exasperating. You don’t"
5230,"blame me, do you? You don’t blame me?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I never blame anyone,” said Kemp. “It’s quite out of fashion. What did"
5230,"you do next?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I was hungry. Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese—more than"
5230,"sufficient to satisfy my hunger. I took some brandy and water, and then"
5230,"went up past my impromptu bag—he was lying quite still—to the room"
5230,"containing the old clothes. This looked out upon the street, two lace"
5230,"curtains brown with dirt guarding the window. I went and peered out"
5230,"through their interstices. Outside the day was bright—by contrast with"
5230,"the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself,"
5230,"dazzlingly bright. A brisk traffic was going by, fruit carts, a hansom,"
5230,"a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes, a fishmonger’s cart. I turned with"
5230,"spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind"
5230,"me. My excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my"
5230,"position again. The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline, used,"
5230,"I suppose, in cleaning the garments."
5230,""
5230,"“I began a systematic search of the place. I should judge the hunchback"
5230,"had been alone in the house for some time. He was a curious person."
5230,"Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the"
5230,"clothes storeroom, and then I made a deliberate selection. I found a"
5230,"handbag I thought a suitable possession, and some powder, rouge, and"
5230,"sticking-plaster."
5230,""
5230,"“I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was"
5230,"to show of me, in order to render myself visible, but the disadvantage"
5230,"of this lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other"
5230,"appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish"
5230,"again. Finally I chose a mask of the better type, slightly grotesque"
5230,"but not more so than many human beings, dark glasses, greyish whiskers,"
5230,"and a wig. I could find no underclothing, but that I could buy"
5230,"subsequently, and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and"
5230,"some white cashmere scarfs. I could find no socks, but the hunchback’s"
5230,"boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed. In a desk in the shop were"
5230,"three sovereigns and about thirty shillings’ worth of silver, and in a"
5230,"locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold. I"
5230,"could go forth into the world again, equipped."
5230,""
5230,"“Then came a curious hesitation. Was my appearance really credible? I"
5230,"tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass, inspecting myself"
5230,"from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink, but it all"
5230,"seemed sound. I was grotesque to the theatrical pitch, a stage miser,"
5230,"but I was certainly not a physical impossibility. Gathering confidence,"
5230,"I took my looking-glass down into the shop, pulled down the shop"
5230,"blinds, and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of"
5230,"the cheval glass in the corner."
5230,""
5230,"“I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop"
5230,"door and marched out into the street, leaving the little man to get out"
5230,"of his sheet again when he liked. In five minutes a dozen turnings"
5230,"intervened between me and the costumier’s shop. No one appeared to"
5230,"notice me very pointedly. My last difficulty seemed overcome.”"
5230,""
5230,"He stopped again."
5230,""
5230,"“And you troubled no more about the hunchback?” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“No,” said the Invisible Man. “Nor have I heard what became of him. I"
5230,"suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out. The knots were pretty"
5230,"tight.”"
5230,""
5230,"He became silent and went to the window and stared out."
5230,""
5230,"“What happened when you went out into the Strand?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Oh!—disillusionment again. I thought my troubles were over."
5230,"Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose,"
5230,"everything—save to give away my secret. So I thought. Whatever I did,"
5230,"whatever the consequences might be, was nothing to me. I had merely to"
5230,"fling aside my garments and vanish. No person could hold me. I could"
5230,"take my money where I found it. I decided to treat myself to a"
5230,"sumptuous feast, and then put up at a good hotel, and accumulate a new"
5230,"outfit of property. I felt amazingly confident; it’s not particularly"
5230,"pleasant recalling that I was an ass. I went into a place and was"
5230,"already ordering lunch, when it occurred to me that I could not eat"
5230,"unless I exposed my invisible face. I finished ordering the lunch, told"
5230,"the man I should be back in ten minutes, and went out exasperated. I"
5230,"don’t know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not quite so badly,” said Kemp, “but I can imagine it.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I could have smashed the silly devils. At last, faint with the desire"
5230,"for tasteful food, I went into another place and demanded a private"
5230,"room. ‘I am disfigured,’ I said. ‘Badly.’ They looked at me curiously,"
5230,"but of course it was not their affair—and so at last I got my lunch. It"
5230,"was not particularly well served, but it sufficed; and when I had had"
5230,"it, I sat over a cigar, trying to plan my line of action. And outside a"
5230,"snowstorm was beginning."
5230,""
5230,"“The more I thought it over, Kemp, the more I realised what a helpless"
5230,"absurdity an Invisible Man was—in a cold and dirty climate and a"
5230,"crowded civilised city. Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt"
5230,"of a thousand advantages. That afternoon it seemed all disappointment."
5230,"I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt"
5230,"invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to"
5230,"enjoy them when they are got. Ambition—what is the good of pride of"
5230,"place when you cannot appear there? What is the good of the love of"
5230,"woman when her name must needs be Delilah? I have no taste for"
5230,"politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport."
5230,"What was I to do? And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery, a"
5230,"swathed and bandaged caricature of a man!”"
5230,""
5230,"He paused, and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window."
5230,""
5230,"“But how did you get to Iping?” said Kemp, anxious to keep his guest"
5230,"busy talking."
5230,""
5230,"“I went there to work. I had one hope. It was a half idea! I have it"
5230,"still. It is a full blown idea now. A way of getting back! Of restoring"
5230,"what I have done. When I choose. When I have done all I mean to do"
5230,"invisibly. And that is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You went straight to Iping?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Yes. I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my"
5230,"cheque-book, my luggage and underclothing, order a quantity of"
5230,"chemicals to work out this idea of mine—I will show you the"
5230,"calculations as soon as I get my books—and then I started. Jove! I"
5230,"remember the snowstorm now, and the accursed bother it was to keep the"
5230,"snow from damping my pasteboard nose.”"
5230,""
5230,"“At the end,” said Kemp, “the day before yesterday, when they found you"
5230,"out, you rather—to judge by the papers—”"
5230,""
5230,"“I did. Rather. Did I kill that fool of a constable?”"
5230,""
5230,"“No,” said Kemp. “He’s expected to recover.”"
5230,""
5230,"“That’s his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why couldn’t"
5230,"they leave me alone? And that grocer lout?”"
5230,""
5230,"“There are no deaths expected,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“I don’t know about that tramp of mine,” said the Invisible Man, with"
5230,"an unpleasant laugh."
5230,""
5230,"“By Heaven, Kemp, you don’t know what rage _is_! ... To have worked for"
5230,"years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some fumbling"
5230,"purblind idiot messing across your course! ... Every conceivable sort"
5230,"of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me."
5230,""
5230,"“If I have much more of it, I shall go wild—I shall start mowing ’em."
5230,""
5230,"“As it is, they’ve made things a thousand times more difficult.”"
5230,""
5230,"“No doubt it’s exasperating,” said Kemp, drily."

5230,"CHAPTER XXIV."
5230,"THE PLAN THAT FAILED"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"“But now,” said Kemp, with a side glance out of the window, “what are"
5230,"we to do?”"
5230,""
5230,"He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent"
5230,"the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing"
5230,"up the hill road—with an intolerable slowness, as it seemed to Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock?"
5230,"_Had_ you any plan?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I was going to clear out of the country. But I have altered that plan"
5230,"rather since seeing you. I thought it would be wise, now the weather is"
5230,"hot and invisibility possible, to make for the South. Especially as my"
5230,"secret was known, and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and"
5230,"muffled man. You have a line of steamers from here to France. My idea"
5230,"was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage. Thence I could"
5230,"go by train into Spain, or else get to Algiers. It would not be"
5230,"difficult. There a man might always be invisible—and yet live. And do"
5230,"things. I was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier,"
5230,"until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me.”"
5230,""
5230,"“That’s clear.”"
5230,""
5230,"“And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me! He _has_ hidden"
5230,"my books, Kemp. Hidden my books! If I can lay my hands on him!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Best plan to get the books out of him first.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But where is he? Do you know?”"
5230,""
5230,"“He’s in the town police station, locked up, by his own request, in the"
5230,"strongest cell in the place.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Cur!” said the Invisible Man."
5230,""
5230,"“But that hangs up your plans a little.”"
5230,""
5230,"“We must get those books; those books are vital.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Certainly,” said Kemp, a little nervously, wondering if he heard"
5230,"footsteps outside. “Certainly we must get those books. But that won’t"
5230,"be difficult, if he doesn’t know they’re for you.”"
5230,""
5230,"“No,” said the Invisible Man, and thought."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going, but the"
5230,"Invisible Man resumed of his own accord."
5230,""
5230,"“Blundering into your house, Kemp,” he said, “changes all my plans. For"
5230,"you are a man that can understand. In spite of all that has happened,"
5230,"in spite of this publicity, of the loss of my books, of what I have"
5230,"suffered, there still remain great possibilities, huge possibilities—”"
5230,""
5230,"“You have told no one I am here?” he asked abruptly."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp hesitated. “That was implied,” he said."
5230,""
5230,"“No one?” insisted Griffin."
5230,""
5230,"“Not a soul.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Ah! Now—” The Invisible Man stood up, and sticking his arms akimbo"
5230,"began to pace the study."
5230,""
5230,"“I made a mistake, Kemp, a huge mistake, in carrying this thing through"
5230,"alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone—it is"
5230,"wonderful how little a man can do alone! To rob a little, to hurt a"
5230,"little, and there is the end."
5230,""
5230,"“What I want, Kemp, is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place, an"
5230,"arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace, and"
5230,"unsuspected. I must have a confederate. With a confederate, with food"
5230,"and rest—a thousand things are possible."
5230,""
5230,"“Hitherto I have gone on vague lines. We have to consider all that"
5230,"invisibility means, all that it does not mean. It means little"
5230,"advantage for eavesdropping and so forth—one makes sounds. It’s of"
5230,"little help—a little help perhaps—in housebreaking and so forth. Once"
5230,"you’ve caught me you could easily imprison me. But on the other hand I"
5230,"am hard to catch. This invisibility, in fact, is only good in two"
5230,"cases: It’s useful in getting away, it’s useful in approaching. It’s"
5230,"particularly useful, therefore, in killing. I can walk round a man,"
5230,"whatever weapon he has, choose my point, strike as I like. Dodge as I"
5230,"like. Escape as I like.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp’s hand went to his moustache. Was that a movement downstairs?"
5230,""
5230,"“And it is killing we must do, Kemp.”"
5230,""
5230,"“It is killing we must do,” repeated Kemp. “I’m listening to your plan,"
5230,"Griffin, but I’m not agreeing, mind. _Why_ killing?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying. The point is, they know"
5230,"there is an Invisible Man—as well as we know there is an Invisible Man."
5230,"And that Invisible Man, Kemp, must now establish a Reign of Terror."
5230,"Yes; no doubt it’s startling. But I mean it. A Reign of Terror. He must"
5230,"take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it. He must"
5230,"issue his orders. He can do that in a thousand ways—scraps of paper"
5230,"thrust under doors would suffice. And all who disobey his orders he"
5230,"must kill, and kill all who would defend them.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Humph!” said Kemp, no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound of"
5230,"his front door opening and closing."
5230,""
5230,"“It seems to me, Griffin,” he said, to cover his wandering attention,"
5230,"“that your confederate would be in a difficult position.”"
5230,""
5230,"“No one would know he was a confederate,” said the Invisible Man,"
5230,"eagerly. And then suddenly, “Hush! What’s that downstairs?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Nothing,” said Kemp, and suddenly began to speak loud and fast. “I"
5230,"don’t agree to this, Griffin,” he said. “Understand me, I don’t agree"
5230,"to this. Why dream of playing a game against the race? How can you hope"
5230,"to gain happiness? Don’t be a lone wolf. Publish your results; take the"
5230,"world—take the nation at least—into your confidence. Think what you"
5230,"might do with a million helpers—”"
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man interrupted—arm extended. “There are footsteps coming"
5230,"upstairs,” he said in a low voice."
5230,""
5230,"“Nonsense,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Let me see,” said the Invisible Man, and advanced, arm extended, to"
5230,"the door."
5230,""
5230,"And then things happened very swiftly. Kemp hesitated for a second and"
5230,"then moved to intercept him. The Invisible Man started and stood still."
5230,"“Traitor!” cried the Voice, and suddenly the dressing-gown opened, and"
5230,"sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe. Kemp made three swift steps"
5230,"to the door, and forthwith the Invisible Man—his legs had"
5230,"vanished—sprang to his feet with a shout. Kemp flung the door open."
5230,""
5230,"As it opened, there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and"
5230,"voices."
5230,""
5230,"With a quick movement Kemp thrust the Invisible Man back, sprang aside,"
5230,"and slammed the door. The key was outside and ready. In another moment"
5230,"Griffin would have been alone in the belvedere study, a prisoner. Save"
5230,"for one little thing. The key had been slipped in hastily that morning."
5230,"As Kemp slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp’s face became white. He tried to grip the door handle with both"
5230,"hands. For a moment he stood lugging. Then the door gave six inches."
5230,"But he got it closed again. The second time it was jerked a foot wide,"
5230,"and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening. His throat"
5230,"was gripped by invisible fingers, and he left his hold on the handle to"
5230,"defend himself. He was forced back, tripped and pitched heavily into"
5230,"the corner of the landing. The empty dressing-gown was flung on the top"
5230,"of him."
5230,""
5230,"Halfway up the staircase was Colonel Adye, the recipient of Kemp’s"
5230,"letter, the chief of the Burdock police. He was staring aghast at the"
5230,"sudden appearance of Kemp, followed by the extraordinary sight of"
5230,"clothing tossing empty in the air. He saw Kemp felled, and struggling"
5230,"to his feet. He saw him rush forward, and go down again, felled like an"
5230,"ox."
5230,""
5230,"Then suddenly he was struck violently. By nothing! A vast weight, it"
5230,"seemed, leapt upon him, and he was hurled headlong down the staircase,"
5230,"with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin. An invisible foot"
5230,"trod on his back, a ghostly patter passed downstairs, he heard the two"
5230,"police officers in the hall shout and run, and the front door of the"
5230,"house slammed violently."
5230,""
5230,"He rolled over and sat up staring. He saw, staggering down the"
5230,"staircase, Kemp, dusty and disheveled, one side of his face white from"
5230,"a blow, his lip bleeding, and a pink dressing-gown and some"
5230,"underclothing held in his arms."
5230,""
5230,"“My God!” cried Kemp, “the game’s up! He’s gone!”"

5230,"CHAPTER XXV."
5230,"THE HUNTING OF THE INVISIBLE MAN"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"For a space Kemp was too inarticulate to make Adye understand the swift"
5230,"things that had just happened. They stood on the landing, Kemp speaking"
5230,"swiftly, the grotesque swathings of Griffin still on his arm. But"
5230,"presently Adye began to grasp something of the situation."
5230,""
5230,"“He is mad,” said Kemp; “inhuman. He is pure selfishness. He thinks of"
5230,"nothing but his own advantage, his own safety. I have listened to such"
5230,"a story this morning of brutal self-seeking.... He has wounded men. He"
5230,"will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a panic."
5230,"Nothing can stop him. He is going out now—furious!”"
5230,""
5230,"“He must be caught,” said Adye. “That is certain.”"
5230,""
5230,"“But how?” cried Kemp, and suddenly became full of ideas. “You must"
5230,"begin at once. You must set every available man to work; you must"
5230,"prevent his leaving this district. Once he gets away, he may go through"
5230,"the countryside as he wills, killing and maiming. He dreams of a reign"
5230,"of terror! A reign of terror, I tell you. You must set a watch on"
5230,"trains and roads and shipping. The garrison must help. You must wire"
5230,"for help. The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of"
5230,"recovering some books of notes he counts of value. I will tell you of"
5230,"that! There is a man in your police station—Marvel.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I know,” said Adye, “I know. Those books—yes. But the tramp....”"
5230,""
5230,"“Says he hasn’t them. But he thinks the tramp has. And you must prevent"
5230,"him from eating or sleeping; day and night the country must be astir"
5230,"for him. Food must be locked up and secured, all food, so that he will"
5230,"have to break his way to it. The houses everywhere must be barred"
5230,"against him. Heaven send us cold nights and rain! The whole"
5230,"country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting. I tell you, Adye, he"
5230,"is a danger, a disaster; unless he is pinned and secured, it is"
5230,"frightful to think of the things that may happen.”"
5230,""
5230,"“What else can we do?” said Adye. “I must go down at once and begin"
5230,"organising. But why not come? Yes—you come too! Come, and we must hold"
5230,"a sort of council of war—get Hopps to help—and the railway managers. By"
5230,"Jove! it’s urgent. Come along—tell me as we go. What else is there we"
5230,"can do? Put that stuff down.”"
5230,""
5230,"In another moment Adye was leading the way downstairs. They found the"
5230,"front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty"
5230,"air. “He’s got away, sir,” said one."
5230,""
5230,"“We must go to the central station at once,” said Adye. “One of you go"
5230,"on down and get a cab to come up and meet us—quickly. And now, Kemp,"
5230,"what else?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Dogs,” said Kemp. “Get dogs. They don’t see him, but they wind him."
5230,"Get dogs.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Good,” said Adye. “It’s not generally known, but the prison officials"
5230,"over at Halstead know a man with bloodhounds. Dogs. What else?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Bear in mind,” said Kemp, “his food shows. After eating, his food"
5230,"shows until it is assimilated. So that he has to hide after eating. You"
5230,"must keep on beating. Every thicket, every quiet corner. And put all"
5230,"weapons—all implements that might be weapons, away. He can’t carry such"
5230,"things for long. And what he can snatch up and strike men with must be"
5230,"hidden away.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Good again,” said Adye. “We shall have him yet!”"
5230,""
5230,"“And on the roads,” said Kemp, and hesitated."
5230,""
5230,"“Yes?” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“Powdered glass,” said Kemp. “It’s cruel, I know. But think of what he"
5230,"may do!”"
5230,""
5230,"Adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth. “It’s unsportsmanlike."
5230,"I don’t know. But I’ll have powdered glass got ready. If he goes too"
5230,"far....”"
5230,""
5230,"“The man’s become inhuman, I tell you,” said Kemp. “I am as sure he"
5230,"will establish a reign of terror—so soon as he has got over the"
5230,"emotions of this escape—as I am sure I am talking to you. Our only"
5230,"chance is to be ahead. He has cut himself off from his kind. His blood"
5230,"be upon his own head.”"

5230,"CHAPTER XXVI."
5230,"THE WICKSTEED MURDER"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp’s house in a state"
5230,"of blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp’s gateway was violently"
5230,"caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken, and"
5230,"thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human"
5230,"perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did. But one can"
5230,"imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon, up the hill and on"
5230,"to the open downland behind Port Burdock, raging and despairing at his"
5230,"intolerable fate, and sheltering at last, heated and weary, amid the"
5230,"thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again his shattered schemes"
5230,"against his species. That seems the most probable refuge for him, for"
5230,"there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about"
5230,"two in the afternoon."
5230,""
5230,"One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and"
5230,"what plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated"
5230,"by Kemp’s treachery, and though we may be able to understand the"
5230,"motives that led to that deceit, we may still imagine and even"
5230,"sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have"
5230,"occasioned. Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford"
5230,"Street experiences may have returned to him, for he had evidently"
5230,"counted on Kemp’s co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised"
5230,"world. At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday, and no"
5230,"living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two. It was a"
5230,"fortunate thing, perhaps, for humanity, but for him it was a fatal"
5230,"inaction."
5230,""
5230,"During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the"
5230,"countryside were busy. In the morning he had still been simply a"
5230,"legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp’s drily"
5230,"worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible antagonist, to be"
5230,"wounded, captured, or overcome, and the countryside began organising"
5230,"itself with inconceivable rapidity. By two o’clock even he might still"
5230,"have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train, but"
5230,"after two that became impossible. Every passenger train along the lines"
5230,"on a great parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester, Brighton and"
5230,"Horsham, travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was almost"
5230,"entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port"
5230,"Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out"
5230,"in groups of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and fields."
5230,""
5230,"Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every"
5230,"cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses, and keep"
5230,"indoors unless they were armed, and all the elementary schools had"
5230,"broken up by three o’clock, and the children, scared and keeping"
5230,"together in groups, were hurrying home. Kemp’s proclamation—signed"
5230,"indeed by Adye—was posted over almost the whole district by four or"
5230,"five o’clock in the afternoon. It gave briefly but clearly all the"
5230,"conditions of the struggle, the necessity of keeping the Invisible Man"
5230,"from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a"
5230,"prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And so swift and"
5230,"decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt and universal was"
5230,"the belief in this strange being, that before nightfall an area of"
5230,"several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege. And"
5230,"before nightfall, too, a thrill of horror went through the whole"
5230,"watching nervous countryside. Going from whispering mouth to mouth,"
5230,"swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country, passed"
5230,"the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed."
5230,""
5230,"If our supposition that the Invisible Man’s refuge was the Hintondean"
5230,"thickets, then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied"
5230,"out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon. We"
5230,"cannot know what the project was, but the evidence that he had the iron"
5230,"rod in hand before he met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming."
5230,""
5230,"Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter. It"
5230,"occurred on the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards from Lord"
5230,"Burdock’s lodge gate. Everything points to a desperate struggle—the"
5230,"trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received, his"
5230,"splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made, save in a"
5230,"murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the theory of"
5230,"madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or"
5230,"forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive habits and"
5230,"appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke such a"
5230,"terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used"
5230,"an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He stopped this quiet"
5230,"man, going quietly home to his midday meal, attacked him, beat down his"
5230,"feeble defences, broke his arm, felled him, and smashed his head to a"
5230,"jelly."
5230,""
5230,"Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he"
5230,"met his victim—he must have been carrying it ready in his hand. Only"
5230,"two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the"
5230,"matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr."
5230,"Wicksteed’s direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred yards out"
5230,"of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect"
5230,"that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the murdered man"
5230,"“trotting” in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit."
5230,"Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the"
5230,"ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his"
5230,"walking-stick. She was the last person to see him alive. He passed out"
5230,"of her sight to his death, the struggle being hidden from her only by a"
5230,"clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground."
5230,""
5230,"Now this, to the present writer’s mind at least, lifts the murder out"
5230,"of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that Griffin had"
5230,"taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention"
5230,"of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this"
5230,"rod inexplicably moving through the air. Without any thought of the"
5230,"Invisible Man—for Port Burdock is ten miles away—he may have pursued"
5230,"it. It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the"
5230,"Invisible Man. One can then imagine the Invisible Man making"
5230,"off—quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the"
5230,"neighbourhood, and Wicksteed, excited and curious, pursuing this"
5230,"unaccountably locomotive object—finally striking at it."
5230,""
5230,"No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged"
5230,"pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position in which"
5230,"Wicksteed’s body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive"
5230,"his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the"
5230,"gravel pit. To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of"
5230,"the Invisible Man, the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine."
5230,""
5230,"But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts—for stories of"
5230,"children are often unreliable—are the discovery of Wicksteed’s body,"
5230,"done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the"
5230,"nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that in the"
5230,"emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which he took it—if"
5230,"he had a purpose—was abandoned. He was certainly an intensely"
5230,"egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his victim, his first"
5230,"victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have released some long"
5230,"pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever"
5230,"scheme of action he had contrived."
5230,""
5230,"After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck across"
5230,"the country towards the downland. There is a story of a voice heard"
5230,"about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom. It was"
5230,"wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever and again it"
5230,"shouted. It must have been queer hearing. It drove up across the middle"
5230,"of a clover field and died away towards the hills."
5230,""
5230,"That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the"
5230,"rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have found houses"
5230,"locked and secured; he may have loitered about railway stations and"
5230,"prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised"
5230,"something of the nature of the campaign against him. And as the evening"
5230,"advanced, the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three"
5230,"or four men, and noisy with the yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had"
5230,"particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they"
5230,"should support one another. But he avoided them all. We may understand"
5230,"something of his exasperation, and it could have been none the less"
5230,"because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so"
5230,"remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for"
5230,"nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a"
5230,"hunted man. In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in the"
5230,"morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and malignant,"
5230,"prepared for his last great struggle against the world."

5230,"CHAPTER XXVII."
5230,"THE SIEGE OF KEMP’S HOUSE"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Kemp read a strange missive, written in pencil on a greasy sheet of"
5230,"paper."
5230,""
5230,"“You have been amazingly energetic and clever,” this letter ran,"
5230,"“though what you stand to gain by it I cannot imagine. You are against"
5230,"me. For a whole day you have chased me; you have tried to rob me of a"
5230,"night’s rest. But I have had food in spite of you, I have slept in"
5230,"spite of you, and the game is only beginning. The game is only"
5230,"beginning. There is nothing for it, but to start the Terror. This"
5230,"announces the first day of the Terror. Port Burdock is no longer under"
5230,"the Queen, tell your Colonel of Police, and the rest of them; it is"
5230,"under me—the Terror! This is day one of year one of the new epoch—the"
5230,"Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man the First. To begin with"
5230,"the rule will be easy. The first day there will be one execution for"
5230,"the sake of example—a man named Kemp. Death starts for him to-day. He"
5230,"may lock himself away, hide himself away, get guards about him, put on"
5230,"armour if he likes—Death, the unseen Death, is coming. Let him take"
5230,"precautions; it will impress my people. Death starts from the pillar"
5230,"box by midday. The letter will fall in as the postman comes along, then"
5230,"off! The game begins. Death starts. Help him not, my people, lest Death"
5230,"fall upon you also. To-day Kemp is to die.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp read this letter twice, “It’s no hoax,” he said. “That’s his"
5230,"voice! And he means it.”"
5230,""
5230,"He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the"
5230,"postmark Hintondean, and the prosaic detail “2d. to pay.”"
5230,""
5230,"He got up slowly, leaving his lunch unfinished—the letter had come by"
5230,"the one o’clock post—and went into his study. He rang for his"
5230,"housekeeper, and told her to go round the house at once, examine all"
5230,"the fastenings of the windows, and close all the shutters. He closed"
5230,"the shutters of his study himself. From a locked drawer in his bedroom"
5230,"he took a little revolver, examined it carefully, and put it into the"
5230,"pocket of his lounge jacket. He wrote a number of brief notes, one to"
5230,"Colonel Adye, gave them to his servant to take, with explicit"
5230,"instructions as to her way of leaving the house. “There is no danger,”"
5230,"he said, and added a mental reservation, “to you.” He remained"
5230,"meditative for a space after doing this, and then returned to his"
5230,"cooling lunch."
5230,""
5230,"He ate with gaps of thought. Finally he struck the table sharply. “We"
5230,"will have him!” he said; “and I am the bait. He will come too far.”"
5230,""
5230,"He went up to the belvedere, carefully shutting every door after him."
5230,"“It’s a game,” he said, “an odd game—but the chances are all for me,"
5230,"Mr. Griffin, in spite of your invisibility. Griffin _contra mundum_ ..."
5230,"with a vengeance.”"
5230,""
5230,"He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside. “He must get food"
5230,"every day—and I don’t envy him. Did he really sleep last night? Out in"
5230,"the open somewhere—secure from collisions. I wish we could get some"
5230,"good cold wet weather instead of the heat."
5230,""
5230,"“He may be watching me now.”"
5230,""
5230,"He went close to the window. Something rapped smartly against the"
5230,"brickwork over the frame, and made him start violently back."
5230,""
5230,"“I’m getting nervous,” said Kemp. But it was five minutes before he"
5230,"went to the window again. “It must have been a sparrow,” he said."
5230,""
5230,"Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing, and hurried downstairs."
5230,"He unbolted and unlocked the door, examined the chain, put it up, and"
5230,"opened cautiously without showing himself. A familiar voice hailed him."
5230,"It was Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“Your servant’s been assaulted, Kemp,” he said round the door."
5230,""
5230,"“What!” exclaimed Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“Had that note of yours taken away from her. He’s close about here. Let"
5230,"me in.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp released the chain, and Adye entered through as narrow an opening"
5230,"as possible. He stood in the hall, looking with infinite relief at Kemp"
5230,"refastening the door. “Note was snatched out of her hand. Scared her"
5230,"horribly. She’s down at the station. Hysterics. He’s close here. What"
5230,"was it about?”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp swore."
5230,""
5230,"“What a fool I was,” said Kemp. “I might have known. It’s not an hour’s"
5230,"walk from Hintondean. Already?”"
5230,""
5230,"“What’s up?” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“Look here!” said Kemp, and led the way into his study. He handed Adye"
5230,"the Invisible Man’s letter. Adye read it and whistled softly. “And"
5230,"you—?” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“Proposed a trap—like a fool,” said Kemp, “and sent my proposal out by"
5230,"a maid servant. To him.”"
5230,""
5230,"Adye followed Kemp’s profanity."
5230,""
5230,"“He’ll clear out,” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“Not he,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs. Adye had a silvery"
5230,"glimpse of a little revolver half out of Kemp’s pocket. “It’s a window,"
5230,"upstairs!” said Kemp, and led the way up. There came a second smash"
5230,"while they were still on the staircase. When they reached the study"
5230,"they found two of the three windows smashed, half the room littered"
5230,"with splintered glass, and one big flint lying on the writing table."
5230,"The two men stopped in the doorway, contemplating the wreckage. Kemp"
5230,"swore again, and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a"
5230,"pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering"
5230,"triangles into the room."
5230,""
5230,"“What’s this for?” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“It’s a beginning,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“There’s no way of climbing up here?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not for a cat,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“No shutters?”"
5230,""
5230,"“Not here. All the downstairs rooms—Hullo!”"
5230,""
5230,"Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs."
5230,"“Confound him!” said Kemp. “That must be—yes—it’s one of the bedrooms."
5230,"He’s going to do all the house. But he’s a fool. The shutters are up,"
5230,"and the glass will fall outside. He’ll cut his feet.”"
5230,""
5230,"Another window proclaimed its destruction. The two men stood on the"
5230,"landing perplexed. “I have it!” said Adye. “Let me have a stick or"
5230,"something, and I’ll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put"
5230,"on. That ought to settle him! They’re hard by—not ten minutes—”"
5230,""
5230,"Another window went the way of its fellows."
5230,""
5230,"“You haven’t a revolver?” asked Adye."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp’s hand went to his pocket. Then he hesitated. “I haven’t one—at"
5230,"least to spare.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’ll bring it back,” said Adye, “you’ll be safe here.”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp, ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness, handed him the"
5230,"weapon."
5230,""
5230,"“Now for the door,” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"As they stood hesitating in the hall, they heard one of the first-floor"
5230,"bedroom windows crack and clash. Kemp went to the door and began to"
5230,"slip the bolts as silently as possible. His face was a little paler"
5230,"than usual. “You must step straight out,” said Kemp. In another moment"
5230,"Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the"
5230,"staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more comfortable with his"
5230,"back against the door. Then he marched, upright and square, down the"
5230,"steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate. A little breeze"
5230,"seemed to ripple over the grass. Something moved near him. “Stop a"
5230,"bit,” said a Voice, and Adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the"
5230,"revolver."
5230,""
5230,"“Well?” said Adye, white and grim, and every nerve tense."
5230,""
5230,"“Oblige me by going back to the house,” said the Voice, as tense and"
5230,"grim as Adye’s."
5230,""
5230,"“Sorry,” said Adye a little hoarsely, and moistened his lips with his"
5230,"tongue. The Voice was on his left front, he thought. Suppose he were to"
5230,"take his luck with a shot?"
5230,""
5230,"“What are you going for?” said the Voice, and there was a quick"
5230,"movement of the two, and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of"
5230,"Adye’s pocket."
5230,""
5230,"Adye desisted and thought. “Where I go,” he said slowly, “is my own"
5230,"business.” The words were still on his lips, when an arm came round his"
5230,"neck, his back felt a knee, and he was sprawling backward. He drew"
5230,"clumsily and fired absurdly, and in another moment he was struck in the"
5230,"mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip. He made a vain clutch at"
5230,"a slippery limb, tried to struggle up and fell back. “Damn!” said Adye."
5230,"The Voice laughed. “I’d kill you now if it wasn’t the waste of a"
5230,"bullet,” it said. He saw the revolver in mid-air, six feet off,"
5230,"covering him."
5230,""
5230,"“Well?” said Adye, sitting up."
5230,""
5230,"“Get up,” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"Adye stood up."
5230,""
5230,"“Attention,” said the Voice, and then fiercely, “Don’t try any games."
5230,"Remember I can see your face if you can’t see mine. You’ve got to go"
5230,"back to the house.”"
5230,""
5230,"“He won’t let me in,” said Adye."
5230,""
5230,"“That’s a pity,” said the Invisible Man. “I’ve got no quarrel with"
5230,"you.”"
5230,""
5230,"Adye moistened his lips again. He glanced away from the barrel of the"
5230,"revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday"
5230,"sun, the smooth green down, the white cliff of the Head, and the"
5230,"multitudinous town, and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet. His"
5230,"eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and"
5230,"earth, six yards away. “What am I to do?” he said sullenly."
5230,""
5230,"“What am _I_ to do?” asked the Invisible Man. “You will get help. The"
5230,"only thing is for you to go back.”"
5230,""
5230,"“I will try. If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door?”"
5230,""
5230,"“I’ve got no quarrel with you,” said the Voice."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now crouching"
5230,"among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the"
5230,"study window sill, he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen. “Why"
5230,"doesn’t he fire?” whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver moved a"
5230,"little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp’s eyes. He shaded"
5230,"his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam."
5230,""
5230,"“Surely!” he said, “Adye has given up the revolver.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Promise not to rush the door,” Adye was saying. “Don’t push a winning"
5230,"game too far. Give a man a chance.”"
5230,""
5230,"“You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise"
5230,"anything.”"
5230,""
5230,"Adye’s decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house,"
5230,"walking slowly with his hands behind him. Kemp watched him—puzzled. The"
5230,"revolver vanished, flashed again into sight, vanished again, and became"
5230,"evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following Adye."
5230,"Then things happened very quickly. Adye leapt backwards, swung around,"
5230,"clutched at this little object, missed it, threw up his hands and fell"
5230,"forward on his face, leaving a little puff of blue in the air. Kemp did"
5230,"not hear the sound of the shot. Adye writhed, raised himself on one"
5230,"arm, fell forward, and lay still."
5230,""
5230,"For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of Adye’s"
5230,"attitude. The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing seemed stirring"
5230,"in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other"
5230,"through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate. Adye lay on"
5230,"the lawn near the gate. The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road"
5230,"were drawn, but in one little green summer-house was a white figure,"
5230,"apparently an old man asleep. Kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the"
5230,"house for a glimpse of the revolver, but it had vanished. His eyes came"
5230,"back to Adye. The game was opening well."
5230,""
5230,"Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door, that grew at last"
5230,"tumultuous, but pursuant to Kemp’s instructions the servants had locked"
5230,"themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a silence. Kemp sat"
5230,"listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows,"
5230,"one after another. He went to the staircase head and stood listening"
5230,"uneasily. He armed himself with his bedroom poker, and went to examine"
5230,"the interior fastenings of the ground-floor windows again. Everything"
5230,"was safe and quiet. He returned to the belvedere. Adye lay motionless"
5230,"over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen. Coming along the"
5230,"road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen."
5230,""
5230,"Everything was deadly still. The three people seemed very slow in"
5230,"approaching. He wondered what his antagonist was doing."
5230,""
5230,"He started. There was a smash from below. He hesitated and went"
5230,"downstairs again. Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the"
5230,"splintering of wood. He heard a smash and the destructive clang of the"
5230,"iron fastenings of the shutters. He turned the key and opened the"
5230,"kitchen door. As he did so, the shutters, split and splintering, came"
5230,"flying inward. He stood aghast. The window frame, save for one"
5230,"crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of glass remained in"
5230,"the frame. The shutters had been driven in with an axe, and now the axe"
5230,"was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron"
5230,"bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished. He saw"
5230,"the revolver lying on the path outside, and then the little weapon"
5230,"sprang into the air. He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too"
5230,"late, and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his"
5230,"head. He slammed and locked the door, and as he stood outside he heard"
5230,"Griffin shouting and laughing. Then the blows of the axe with its"
5230,"splitting and smashing consequences, were resumed."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp stood in the passage trying to think. In a moment the Invisible"
5230,"Man would be in the kitchen. This door would not keep him a moment, and"
5230,"then—"
5230,""
5230,"A ringing came at the front door again. It would be the policemen. He"
5230,"ran into the hall, put up the chain, and drew the bolts. He made the"
5230,"girl speak before he dropped the chain, and the three people blundered"
5230,"into the house in a heap, and Kemp slammed the door again."
5230,""
5230,"“The Invisible Man!” said Kemp. “He has a revolver, with two"
5230,"shots—left. He’s killed Adye. Shot him anyhow. Didn’t you see him on"
5230,"the lawn? He’s lying there.”"
5230,""
5230,"“Who?” said one of the policemen."
5230,""
5230,"“Adye,” said Kemp."
5230,""
5230,"“We came in the back way,” said the girl."
5230,""
5230,"“What’s that smashing?” asked one of the policemen."
5230,""
5230,"“He’s in the kitchen—or will be. He has found an axe—”"
5230,""
5230,"Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man’s resounding blows on"
5230,"the kitchen door. The girl stared towards the kitchen, shuddered, and"
5230,"retreated into the dining-room. Kemp tried to explain in broken"
5230,"sentences. They heard the kitchen door give."
5230,""
5230,"“This way,” said Kemp, starting into activity, and bundled the"
5230,"policemen into the dining-room doorway."
5230,""
5230,"“Poker,” said Kemp, and rushed to the fender. He handed the poker he"
5230,"had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other. He"
5230,"suddenly flung himself backward."
5230,""
5230,"“Whup!” said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker."
5230,"The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney"
5230,"Cooper. The second policeman brought his poker down on the little"
5230,"weapon, as one might knock down a wasp, and sent it rattling to the"
5230,"floor."
5230,""
5230,"At the first clash the girl screamed, stood screaming for a moment by"
5230,"the fireplace, and then ran to open the shutters—possibly with an idea"
5230,"of escaping by the shattered window."
5230,""
5230,"The axe receded into the passage, and fell to a position about two feet"
5230,"from the ground. They could hear the Invisible Man breathing. “Stand"
5230,"away, you two,” he said. “I want that man Kemp.”"
5230,""
5230,"“We want you,” said the first policeman, making a quick step forward"
5230,"and wiping with his poker at the Voice. The Invisible Man must have"
5230,"started back, and he blundered into the umbrella stand."
5230,""
5230,"Then, as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had"
5230,"aimed, the Invisible Man countered with the axe, the helmet crumpled"
5230,"like paper, and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head"
5230,"of the kitchen stairs. But the second policeman, aiming behind the axe"
5230,"with his poker, hit something soft that snapped. There was a sharp"
5230,"exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground. The policeman"
5230,"wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing; he put his foot on the axe, and"
5230,"struck again. Then he stood, poker clubbed, listening intent for the"
5230,"slightest movement."
5230,""
5230,"He heard the dining-room window open, and a quick rush of feet within."
5230,"His companion rolled over and sat up, with the blood running down"
5230,"between his eye and ear. “Where is he?” asked the man on the floor."
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t know. I’ve hit him. He’s standing somewhere in the hall. Unless"
5230,"he’s slipped past you. Doctor Kemp—sir.”"
5230,""
5230,"Pause."
5230,""
5230,"“Doctor Kemp,” cried the policeman again."
5230,""
5230,"The second policeman began struggling to his feet. He stood up."
5230,"Suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be"
5230,"heard. “Yap!” cried the first policeman, and incontinently flung his"
5230,"poker. It smashed a little gas bracket."
5230,""
5230,"He made as if he would pursue the Invisible Man downstairs. Then he"
5230,"thought better of it and stepped into the dining-room."
5230,""
5230,"“Doctor Kemp—” he began, and stopped short."
5230,""
5230,"“Doctor Kemp’s a hero,” he said, as his companion looked over his"
5230,"shoulder."
5230,""
5230,"The dining-room window was wide open, and neither housemaid nor Kemp"
5230,"was to be seen."
5230,""
5230,"The second policeman’s opinion of Kemp was terse and vivid."
5230,""

5230,"CHAPTER XXVIII."
5230,"THE HUNTER HUNTED"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"Mr. Heelas, Mr. Kemp’s nearest neighbour among the villa holders, was"
5230,"asleep in his summer house when the siege of Kemp’s house began. Mr."
5230,"Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe “in all"
5230,"this nonsense” about an Invisible Man. His wife, however, as he was"
5230,"subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted upon walking about his"
5230,"garden just as if nothing was the matter, and he went to sleep in the"
5230,"afternoon in accordance with the custom of years. He slept through the"
5230,"smashing of the windows, and then woke up suddenly with a curious"
5230,"persuasion of something wrong. He looked across at Kemp’s house, rubbed"
5230,"his eyes and looked again. Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat"
5230,"listening. He said he was damned, but still the strange thing was"
5230,"visible. The house looked as though it had been deserted for"
5230,"weeks—after a violent riot. Every window was broken, and every window,"
5230,"save those of the belvedere study, was blinded by the internal"
5230,"shutters."
5230,""
5230,"“I could have sworn it was all right”—he looked at his watch—“twenty"
5230,"minutes ago.”"
5230,""
5230,"He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass, far"
5230,"away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a still"
5230,"more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window were"
5230,"flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and"
5230,"garments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash."
5230,"Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her—Dr. Kemp! In another"
5230,"moment the window was open, and the housemaid was struggling out; she"
5230,"pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs. Mr. Heelas stood up,"
5230,"exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things. He saw"
5230,"Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the window, and reappear almost"
5230,"instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as"
5230,"he ran, like a man who evades observation. He vanished behind a"
5230,"laburnum, and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on"
5230,"the open down. In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a"
5230,"tremendous pace down the slope towards Mr. Heelas."
5230,""
5230,"“Lord!” cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; “it’s that Invisible Man"
5230,"brute! It’s right, after all!”"
5230,""
5230,"With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook"
5230,"watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting"
5230,"towards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a slamming of"
5230,"doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas bellowing like a"
5230,"bull. “Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut everything!—the Invisible"
5230,"Man is coming!” Instantly the house was full of screams and directions,"
5230,"and scurrying feet. He ran himself to shut the French windows that"
5230,"opened on the veranda; as he did so Kemp’s head and shoulders and knee"
5230,"appeared over the edge of the garden fence. In another moment Kemp had"
5230,"ploughed through the asparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn"
5230,"to the house."
5230,""
5230,"“You can’t come in,” said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts. “I’m very"
5230,"sorry if he’s after you, but you can’t come in!”"
5230,""
5230,"Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and"
5230,"then shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his efforts"
5230,"were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end, and went to"
5230,"hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side gate to the"
5230,"front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr. Heelas staring"
5230,"from his window—a face of horror—had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish,"
5230,"ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen."
5230,"At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately upstairs, and the rest of the"
5230,"chase is beyond his purview. But as he passed the staircase window, he"
5230,"heard the side gate slam."
5230,""
5230,"Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward"
5230,"direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race"
5230,"he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only"
5230,"four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of training, and though"
5230,"his face was white and wet, his wits were cool to the last. He ran with"
5230,"wide strides, and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened, wherever"
5230,"there came a patch of raw flints, or a bit of broken glass shone"
5230,"dazzling, he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed"
5230,"to take what line they would."
5230,""
5230,"For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was"
5230,"indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town"
5230,"far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been"
5230,"a slower or more painful method of progression than running. All the"
5230,"gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun, looked locked and barred;"
5230,"no doubt they were locked and barred—by his own orders. But at any rate"
5230,"they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this! The town"
5230,"was rising up now, the sea had dropped out of sight behind it, and"
5230,"people down below were stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill"
5230,"foot. Beyond that was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard"
5230,"behind him? Spurt."
5230,""
5230,"The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and his"
5230,"breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite near now,"
5230,"and the “Jolly Cricketers” was noisily barring its doors. Beyond the"
5230,"tram were posts and heaps of gravel—the drainage works. He had a"
5230,"transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors, and"
5230,"then he resolved to go for the police station. In another moment he had"
5230,"passed the door of the “Jolly Cricketers,” and was in the blistering"
5230,"fag end of the street, with human beings about him. The tram driver and"
5230,"his helper—arrested by the sight of his furious haste—stood staring"
5230,"with the tram horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of"
5230,"navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel."
5230,""
5230,"His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his"
5230,"pursuer, and leapt forward again. “The Invisible Man!” he cried to the"
5230,"navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration leapt"
5230,"the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase. Then"
5230,"abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side"
5230,"street, rushed by a greengrocer’s cart, hesitated for the tenth of a"
5230,"second at the door of a sweetstuff shop, and then made for the mouth of"
5230,"an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again. Two or three"
5230,"little children were playing here, and shrieked and scattered at his"
5230,"apparition, and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers"
5230,"revealed their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three"
5230,"hundred yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware"
5230,"of a tumultuous vociferation and running people."
5230,""
5230,"He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off ran"
5230,"a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade,"
5230,"and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched. Up"
5230,"the street others followed these two, striking and shouting. Down"
5230,"towards the town, men and women were running, and he noticed clearly"
5230,"one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand. “Spread"
5230,"out! Spread out!” cried some one. Kemp suddenly grasped the altered"
5230,"condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked round, panting. “He’s"
5230,"close here!” he cried. “Form a line across—”"
5230,""
5230,"He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face round"
5230,"towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his feet, and he"
5230,"struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit again under the jaw,"
5230,"and sprawled headlong on the ground. In another moment a knee"
5230,"compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of eager hands gripped his"
5230,"throat, but the grip of one was weaker than the other; he grasped the"
5230,"wrists, heard a cry of pain from his assailant, and then the spade of"
5230,"the navvy came whirling through the air above him, and struck something"
5230,"with a dull thud. He felt a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at"
5230,"his throat suddenly relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed"
5230,"himself, grasped a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the"
5230,"unseen elbows near the ground. “I’ve got him!” screamed Kemp. “Help!"
5230,"Help—hold! He’s down! Hold his feet!”"
5230,""
5230,"In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and"
5230,"a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an"
5230,"exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And there"
5230,"was no shouting after Kemp’s cry—only a sound of blows and feet and"
5230,"heavy breathing."
5230,""
5230,"Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of"
5230,"his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in front like"
5230,"a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched, and tore at the"
5230,"Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and"
5230,"lugged him back."
5230,""
5230,"Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There was,"
5230,"I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of"
5230,"“Mercy! Mercy!” that died down swiftly to a sound like choking."
5230,""
5230,"“Get back, you fools!” cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there was a"
5230,"vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. “He’s hurt, I tell you. Stand"
5230,"back!”"
5230,""
5230,"There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of"
5230,"eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches in"
5230,"the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a"
5230,"constable gripped invisible ankles."
5230,""
5230,"“Don’t you leave go of en,” cried the big navvy, holding a"
5230,"blood-stained spade; “he’s shamming.”"
5230,""
5230,"“He’s not shamming,” said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee; “and"
5230,"I’ll hold him.” His face was bruised and already going red; he spoke"
5230,"thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and seemed to"
5230,"be feeling at the face. “The mouth’s all wet,” he said. And then, “Good"
5230,"God!”"
5230,""
5230,"He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of"
5230,"the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of heavy"
5230,"feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd."
5230,"People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of the “Jolly"
5230,"Cricketers” stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said."
5230,""
5230,"Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. “He’s not"
5230,"breathing,” he said, and then, “I can’t feel his heart. His side—ugh!”"
5230,""
5230,"Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy, screamed"
5230,"sharply. “Looky there!” she said, and thrust out a wrinkled finger."
5230,""
5230,"And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent as"
5230,"though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and bones and"
5230,"nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a hand limp and"
5230,"prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared."
5230,""
5230,"“Hullo!” cried the constable. “Here’s his feet a-showing!”"
5230,""
5230,"And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his"
5230,"limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change continued."
5230,"It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came the little white"
5230,"nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the glassy bones and"
5230,"intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first a faint fogginess,"
5230,"and then growing rapidly dense and opaque. Presently they could see his"
5230,"crushed chest and his shoulders, and the dim outline of his drawn and"
5230,"battered features."
5230,""
5230,"When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,"
5230,"naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young"
5230,"man about thirty. His hair and brow were white—not grey with age, but"
5230,"white with the whiteness of albinism—and his eyes were like garnets."
5230,"His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and his expression was one"
5230,"of anger and dismay."
5230,""
5230,"“Cover his face!” said a man. “For Gawd’s sake, cover that face!” and"
5230,"three little children, pushing forward through the crowd, were suddenly"
5230,"twisted round and sent packing off again."
5230,""
5230,"Someone brought a sheet from the “Jolly Cricketers,” and having covered"
5230,"him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on a shabby"
5230,"bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd of ignorant"
5230,"and excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and unpitied, that"
5230,"Griffin, the first of all men to make himself invisible, Griffin, the"
5230,"most gifted physicist the world has ever seen, ended in infinite"
5230,"disaster his strange and terrible career."
5230,""
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"THE EPILOGUE"
5230,""
5230,""
5230,"So ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the Invisible"
5230,"Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn"
5230,"near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of the inn is an"
5230,"empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is the title of this"
5230,"story. The landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of"
5230,"cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a sporadic rosiness of visage."
5230,"Drink generously, and he will tell you generously of all the things"
5230,"that happened to him after that time, and of how the lawyers tried to"
5230,"do him out of the treasure found upon him."
5230,""
5230,"“When they found they couldn’t prove whose money was which, I’m"
5230,"blessed,” he says, “if they didn’t try to make me out a blooming"
5230,"treasure trove! Do I _look_ like a Treasure Trove? And then a gentleman"
5230,"gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire Music"
5230,"’All—just to tell ’em in my own words—barring one.”"
5230,""
5230,"And if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly, you"
5230,"can always do so by asking if there weren’t three manuscript books in"
5230,"the story. He admits there were and proceeds to explain, with"
5230,"asseverations that everybody thinks _he_ has ’em! But bless you! he"
5230,"hasn’t. “The Invisible Man it was took ’em off to hide ’em when I cut"
5230,"and ran for Port Stowe. It’s that Mr. Kemp put people on with the idea"
5230,"of _my_ having ’em.”"
5230,""
5230,"And then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively,"
5230,"bustles nervously with glasses, and presently leaves the bar."
5230,""
5230,"He is a bachelor man—his tastes were ever bachelor, and there are no"
5230,"women folk in the house. Outwardly he buttons—it is expected of him—but"
5230,"in his more vital privacies, in the matter of braces for example, he"
5230,"still turns to string. He conducts his house without enterprise, but"
5230,"with eminent decorum. His movements are slow, and he is a great"
5230,"thinker. But he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable"
5230,"parsimony in the village, and his knowledge of the roads of the South"
5230,"of England would beat Cobbett."
5230,""
5230,"And on Sunday mornings, every Sunday morning, all the year round, while"
5230,"he is closed to the outer world, and every night after ten, he goes"
5230,"into his bar parlour, bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water,"
5230,"and having placed this down, he locks the door and examines the blinds,"
5230,"and even looks under the table. And then, being satisfied of his"
5230,"solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a"
5230,"drawer in that box, and produces three volumes bound in brown leather,"
5230,"and places them solemnly in the middle of the table. The covers are"
5230,"weather-worn and tinged with an algal green—for once they sojourned in"
5230,"a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty water."
5230,"The landlord sits down in an armchair, fills a long clay pipe"
5230,"slowly—gloating over the books the while. Then he pulls one towards him"
5230,"and opens it, and begins to study it—turning over the leaves backwards"
5230,"and forwards."
5230,""
5230,"His brows are knit and his lips move painfully. “Hex, little two up in"
5230,"the air, cross and a fiddle-de-dee. Lord! what a one he was for"
5230,"intellect!”"
5230,""
5230,"Presently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke"
5230,"across the room at things invisible to other eyes. “Full of secrets,”"
5230,"he says. “Wonderful secrets!”"
5230,""
5230,"“Once I get the haul of them—_Lord_!”"
5230,""
5230,"“I wouldn’t do what _he_ did; I’d just—well!” He pulls at his pipe."
5230,""
5230,"So he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life. And"
5230,"though Kemp has fished unceasingly, no human being save the landlord"
5230,"knows those books are there, with the subtle secret of invisibility and"
5230,"a dozen other strange secrets written therein. And none other will know"
5230,"of them until he dies."
