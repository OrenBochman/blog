74233,"                             PREFACE"
74233,""
74233,""
74233,"The fragment of a novel, written by Jane Austen in the first three"
74233,"months of the year in which she died, has no name; but it has long"
74233,"been known to members of her family as _Sanditon_."
74233,""
74233,"The manuscript passed into the possession of Jane Austen’s"
74233,"niece Anna (Mrs. Ben Lefroy); and it was known to Mrs. Lefroy’s"
74233,"half-brother, James Edward Austen-Leigh, the author of the _Memoir"
74233,"of Jane Austen_ first published in 1870. In the second edition"
74233,"(1871) Mr. Austen-Leigh added the cancelled chapter of _Persuasion_,"
74233,"the fragment called _The Watsons_, and _Lady Susan_, and in his"
74233,"concluding chapter gave an account of ‘The Last Work’."
74233,""
74233,"  Such an unfinished fragment cannot be presented to the public;"
74233,"  but I am persuaded that some of Jane Austen’s admirers will be"
74233,"  glad to learn something about the latest creations which were"
74233,"  forming themselves in her mind; and therefore, as some of the"
74233,"  principal characters were already sketched in with a vigorous"
74233,"  hand, I will try to give an idea of them, illustrated by extracts"
74233,"  from the work."
74233,""
74233,"In the account which follows, the fragment is described in some"
74233,"detail; the _verbatim_ quotations amount to perhaps twenty pages of"
74233,"this edition. The present owner[1] of the manuscript has reached"
74233,"the conclusion that, since so much has long been before the public,"
74233,"it is right that the whole should no longer be withheld."
74233,""
74233,"  [Footnote 1: A grand-daughter of Anna Lefroy.]"
74233,""
74233,"Some explanation may be thought necessary of the way in which the"
74233,"fragment is printed. It approximates to the manner of 1817, and"
74233,"the result is somewhat less in bulk than one of the three volumes"
74233,"in which Mr. Egerton or Mr. Murray would doubtless have issued the"
74233,"work if it had been completed for publication. The printer, however,"
74233,"would have made certain departures from his copy: he would have"
74233,"expanded the contractions; he would have broken up the chapters"
74233,"into paragraphs; and he would, in a greater or less degree, have"
74233,"regularized the spelling and the punctuation. It has seemed best not"
74233,"to do this in 1925, but to print the author’s manuscript as nearly"
74233,"as possible in the last form it attained. It may be thought pedantic"
74233,"to reproduce irregularities which the author would not have wished"
74233,"to retain; but it seemed more important to avoid another danger."
74233,"To have smoothed out the manuscript into a specious semblance of"
74233,"finality would have been to prejudice, in some degree, the question"
74233,"how far it did, in fact, represent the author’s final intention."
74233,"This edition, printed as it is, is open to no such objection. It"
74233,"is, for critical purposes, virtually a facsimile of all that Miss"
74233,"Austen wrote and did not erase."
74233,""
74233,"It will be seen from the textual notes, printed at the end of the"
74233,"volume, that the manuscript contains a very large number of erasures"
74233,"and interlineations. It is so neat, and so uniformly spaced, that"
74233,"it is almost everywhere possible to distinguish what was first"
74233,"written from what was added, or substituted, between the lines. These"
74233,"corrections are not such as could have resulted from subsequent"
74233,"revision of a fair copy previously made. In very many places the"
74233,"author has changed her mind _currente calamo_; has begun a sentence"
74233,"in one form and finished it in another. The number and nature of"
74233,"such changes create a presumption, at least, that we are dealing"
74233,"with a first draft."
74233,""
74233,""
74233,"The manuscript consists of three quires. The first and second, which"
74233,"are sewn together, are of 16 and 24 leaves respectively, measuring"
74233,"7½ in. × 4¹¹⁄₁₆ in. The watermark, which occurs several times in"
74233,"both quires, is KENT 1812."
74233,""
74233,"The first quire contains Chapters 1-3. The third chapter appears to"
74233,"end, on f. 16^v, with an incomplete sentence; but the concluding"
74233,"words, _that Loveliness was complete_, were written at the foot of"
74233,"f. 1^r. The second quire contains Chapters 4-8 and part of Chapter"
74233,"9."
74233,""
74233,"The third quire (marked 2 on the first page) is of 40 leaves, 6⅜"
74233,"in. × 4 in. It bears a large ornamental watermark, and also the"
74233,"name JOSEPH COLES and the date 1815. Folios 21-40, i. e. the latter"
74233,"half of the quire, are blank; a fact which suggests that no part"
74233,"of the manuscript is lost. This quire contains the remainder of"
74233,"Chapter 9 (beginning with the words _with a thousand regrets_--p."
74233,"117 of this edition) and Chapters 10-12."
74233,""
74233,"The dates added by Miss Austen are:"
74233,""
74233,"(1) at the top of the first page of the first quire, _Jan: 27.-1817_"
74233,""
74233,"(2) at the top of the first page of the third quire, _March 1^{st}_"
74233,""
74233,"(3) at the end of the last sentence (the last page of the third"
74233,"      quire), _March 18_."
74233,""
74233,"Part of the second quire was originally written in pencil, and"
74233,"afterwards inked over. The passage so written is that printed on"
74233,"pp. 99-101 of this edition (from _cried Lady D--_ to _so seriously"
74233,"that Charlotte_). The author of the _Memoir_ writes, on this point:"
74233,""
74233,"  The chief part of this manuscript is written in her usual firm"
74233,"  and neat hand, but some of the latter pages seem to have been"
74233,"  first traced in pencil, probably when she was too weak to sit"
74233,"  long at her desk, and written over in ink afterwards."
74233,""
74233,"But the manuscript as such does not bear out this implication of"
74233,"a progressive decline. The place at which pencil was used is in"
74233,"fact not much later than the middle; and the latter part of the"
74233,"manuscript shows no change in legibility or in accuracy."

74233," House near the Lane--a House,"
74233," which their Driver on being first required"
74233," to take that direction, had conceived"
74233," to be necessarily their object,"

74233," much indeed, and pitied & cut his"
74233," Horses so sharply, that he might have"
74233," been open to the suspicion of overturning"
74233," them on purpose (especially as"
74233," the Carriage was not his Masters own)"

74233," the Lane, & the Gentleman having"
74233," scrambled out & helped out his companion,"
74233," they neither of them at first"

74233," which I & a few more, have very"
74233," much at heart--the establishment of"
