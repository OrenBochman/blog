## brace expansion

- the bash shell supports brace expansion.
- the idea is that the string before and after are concatenated with element in the braces 


```{bash}
#| label: bash brace expansion
echo "you won "{two,three,four}" points, "
```


```{bash}
#| label: bash brace expansion 2
echo "you won "{1..10}" points, "
```
