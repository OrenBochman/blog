# Concept

- The Teahouse is a forum for supporting new users on english Wikipedia.
- Goal: make a chatbot based on the wikipedia's teahouse history to provide a default support function that works in real time.
- Add telegram support.
- Use reformer model to support long term interactions.
- Develop using pasw/collab 
- Host in wmflabs/wmf cloud/tool server/
- Try to port to use the recently release O(N) 1d NLP transformer so it can work using a CPU !?
