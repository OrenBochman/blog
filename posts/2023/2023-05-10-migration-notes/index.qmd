I was able to stand on the shoulders of Giants, [@navarro2022], [@hill2022], [@kaye2022] when I migrated this blog.

There are lots of details that should be in the guide that are scattered all over the quarto site.

I decided that all posts should have the following fields in their front matter:

1.  title
2.  subtitle
3.  description
4.  date
5.  categories
6.  image
7.  image-description

## Virtual Environments

-   are documented [here](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html#rstudio)
-   ideal one can have one virtual environment for the whole site

## Extras

-   the about page is based on [postcards package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/postcards/readme/README.html)
-   icons for navigation come from [bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/?q=archive%3E)
-   cover images are from [pexels](www.pexels.com)
