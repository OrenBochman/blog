I was able to stand on the shoulders of giants [@rapp2022ultimate] [@navarro2022], [@hill2022], [@kaye2022] when I migrated this blog.

## Markdown

- Quarto's markdown isn't [my favorite]{.mark} markdown implementation.
- It is based on [pandoc spec](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) 

## The devil is in the details

There are lots of details that should be in the guide that are scattered all over the quarto site.

I decided that all posts should have the following fields in their front matter:

1.  title
2.  subtitle
3.  description
4.  date
5.  categories
6.  image
7.  image-description

## Virtual Environments


-   are documented [here](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html#rstudio)
-   ideal one can have one virtual environment for the whole site


## Lightbox Galleries 

so far I used this only in the [this page](../2023-12-20-autogluon/index.html)

the light box plugin was integrated into Quarto in the version 4.1 which I migrated to. 
I have been using light box to make notes of talks and so on. So in for this blog 
adding light boxes is a breeze.

All that's really needed is to change setting in the frontmatter:

```javascript
lightbox: true
```

which I did for all posts by adding the setting to the `_metadata.yaml` in the 
posts directory. And now all images default to opening within their own lightbox 
when clicked upon.

to disable the feature say, on a logo for example just add `.no-lightbox` css style to the image like this:

```markdown
![caption](filename.png){.no-lightbox}
```

if you want to be able to scroll through a series of images we need to decorate each images as follows:


```markdown
![caption](filename.png){group="my-gallery"}
```

An added bonus is that it is possible to zoom into these light-boxed images

## Extras

-   the about page is based on [postcards package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/postcards/readme/README.html)
-   icons for navigation come from [bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/?q=archive%3E)
-   cover images are from [pexels](www.pexels.com)

### Open issues:

- can I readily integrate books and presentation into this blog ?
  - can I drop them in or do I need to build them in another repo 
  - then deploy 
  - then link!?
- how about embedding repls
- how about embedding shiny live apps
