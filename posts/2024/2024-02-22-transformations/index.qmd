In computational linguistics, using different representations can shed light on the structure of language. I'm considering how sentences can be depicted using parse trees or dependency trees, highlighting the inherent ambiguity of natural language and the preservation of lexical units during transformations.

## The Ambiguity and Structure of Language

Natural language is inherently ambiguous, and the ambiguity of small units can multiply, leading to the possibility of multiple interpretations for a single sentence. This ambiguity can be represented through parse trees, each illustrating a different interpretation. An essential aspect of these trees is their inclusion of lexical units, which are the fundamental elements of language, such as words or phrases, that carry meaning. In such cases, humans can ignore this ambiguity and focus on just one such parse.

For a machine, this is more challenging; it may become aware of combinatorially many trees for each sentence, and then it needs to go back and forth picking clues from this collective to eliminate serious parses. Looking and interpreting such trees can be challenging to humans who are used to surface forms. Multiple trees may have the same surface form, but most might have pathological errors in the deep structure. In reality, linguists have, over the years, come up with many formal grammars, each leading to radically different tree structures for any given sentence.

## Preserving Lexical Units in Transformations

Transformations in linguistics refer to the systematic modification of sentence structure without altering the meaning or essential properties of the lexical units involved. This concept echoes [Évariste Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Évariste_Galois)' groundbreaking work in mathematics, where he explored the transformation of the roots of polynomial equations while maintaining their essential structure. Similarly, in linguistics, if we systematically study transformations of tree representations in a way that preserves various essential properties, such as meaning and lexical integrity, we may gain deep insights.

## Implications for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The ability to specify and conduct systematic transformation on tree representations holds great potential for data augmentation in NLP. By understanding and applying transformations that keep lexical units intact, we can generate varied linguistic data that maintains the original meaning, aiding in the development of more robust NLP models.

Moreover, exploring transformations across languages that preserve essential functions, such as meaning, opens the door to creating machine learning (ML) systems capable of finding representations that are minimally ambiguous. This pursuit of a minimally ambiguous representation could lead to the discovery of a synthetic form that is unambiguous and easily translatable across languages.

For example, gender is frequently a semantically meaningless linguistic construct for whole classes of nouns. Yet natural languages use lots of resources to handle gender regardless of its vacuous nature. Certain languages use multiple variants of grammatical gender, yet others do not mark for gender and number as much as others. Are some languages more expressive - Not according to the Saphir Worph hypothesis. However, some languages are more efficient, at least in the sense of information theoretical measures, such as entropy, precision, and recall.

All these suggest seeking more compact alternatives.

## Toward a Deeper Understanding of Language Mechanisms

The quest for a synthetic representation that bridges linguistic gaps and reduces ambiguity has the potential to uncover the deeper mechanisms of language obscured by surface forms. Such a representation may provide invaluable insights into the universal aspects of language, facilitating more effective translation and interpretation by ML systems.

In conclusion, the exploration of linguistic transformations that maintain the integrity of lexical units draws parallels with transformative achievements in mathematics and may lead to profound implications for the advancement of NLP and our understanding of language.

By systematically analyzing and applying these transformations, we can enhance data augmentation techniques, reduce ambiguity in ML representations, and gain deeper insights into the structure and function of language across different linguistic systems.

## Lewis Games and Interlingual Convergence

Now we know that languages affect each other; foreign words, metaphors, and idioms frequently cross language barriers. Grammar is slower to change, but even the most intricate systems, like the conjugation of the verb, are subject to change given enough time.

Given the formal treatment of Lewis Games, we can study the evolution of language, considering how complex constructs like grammar and morphology evolve to increase efficiency (again considered in terms of information theory)

If languages can be coerced to rapidly evolve in lab settings, using agent-based simulations, we can perhaps also learn about the dynamic of transformations by looking at what constitutes evolutionary stable solutions to this evolution of grammar and the lexicon.
