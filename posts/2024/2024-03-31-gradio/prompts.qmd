title: "Gradio Apps"

There are many prompts floating on the web. We can quickly integrate them with \[Gradio\](www.gradio.app) to create small demos to test them.

Some advantages are:

1.  automation
2.  ability to quickly switch between models.

## Interviewer

```{python}
position = 'super model'
not_all_at_once = 'Do not write all the conversation at once.'
no_explanations = 'Do not write explanations.'
sent = "Hi"
prompt = f'''
<human>: I want you to act as an interviewer. 
I will be the candidate and you will ask me the interview questions for the position {position}. 
I want you to only reply as the interviewer. {not_all_at_once} I want you to only do the interview with me.
Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. {no_explanations}  Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. 
My first sentence is "{sent}"
<bot>:
'''
print(prompt)

```

```{python}
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage
import openai
import gradio as gr
import os

#os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] #= "sk-..."  # Replace with your key
#key = os.environ.get('API_Key')

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=1.0, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0613')

def predict(message, history):
    history_langchain_format = []
    for human, ai in history:
        history_langchain_format.append(HumanMessage(content=human))
        history_langchain_format.append(AIMessage(content=ai))
    history_langchain_format.append(HumanMessage(content=message))
    gpt_response = llm(history_langchain_format)
    return gpt_response.content

gr.ChatInterface(predict,examples=[prompt]).launch()

```

Reusable:

-   Do not write all the conversation at once.
-   Ask me the questions and wait for my answers.
-   Do not write explanations.

Notes:

-   note: Now pretty much everything is written twice. this helps since LLM tend to process the prompt left to right and so stuff at the beginning can miss stuff written later.

## Act as an Excel Sheet

```{python}
prompt = f"""
I want you to act as a text based excel. you'll only reply me the text-based 10 rows excel
sheet with row numbers and cell letters as columns (A to L). First column header should
be empty to reference row number. I will tell you what to write into cells and you'll reply
