Agent movement rule **M**:

- Look out as far as vision pemits in the four principal lattice directions and identify the unoccupied site(s) having the most sugar;
- If the greatest sugar value appears on multiple sites then select the nearest one;
- Move to this site
- Collect all the sugar at this new position.

---

5ugarscape rule **$G_\infty$**: 

- Grow back to full capacity immediately.

---

Pollution formation rule **$P_{ \alpha \beta}$**:

-  When sugar quantity $s$ is gathered from the sugarscape, an amount of production pollution is generated in quantity $\alpha s$. 
- When sugar amount $m$ is consumed (metabolized), consumption pollution is generated according to $\beta m$. 
- The total pollution on a site at time t, pt, is the sum of the pollution present at the previous time, plus the pollution resulting from production and consumption activities, that is, $p_t = p_{t-1} + \alpha a_s + \beta m$

---

Agent movement rule M , modified for pollution :

- Look out as far as vision permits in the four principal lattice directions and identify the unoccupied site(s) having the maximum sugar to pollution ratio

---

Agent sex rule **S**:

-  Select a neighboring agent at random;
- If the neighbor is fenile and of the opposite sex and at least one of the agents has an empty neighboring site (for the baby), then a child is born;
- Repeat for all neighbors


Agent inheritance rule **I**: 

- When an agent dies its wealth is equally divided among all its living children.

---

Cultural transmission rule (tag flipping) **K1**:

- For each neighbor, a tag is randomly selected;
- If the neighbor agrees with the agent at that tag position, no change is made; if they disagree, the neighbor's tag is flipped to agree with the agent's tag.

Group membership rule (tag majority) **K2**: 

- Agents are defined to be members of the Blue group when Os outnumber 1 s on their tag strings, and members of the Red group in the opposite case.

Vertical Transmission of Culture

When sex rule S is active, a child's tag string is formed by comparing the parents' tags at each position and applying the following rule: If the parents
have the same tag (both have 0 or both have 1), the child is assigned that tag. If, however, one parent has tag 0 and the other has tag 1, then we toss a fair coin.
If it comes up heads, the child's tag is 1, if tails, it is O.

Agent combat rule **C_n**:

- Look out as far as in the four principal lattice directions;
- Throw out all sites occupied by members of the agent's own tribe;
- Throw out all sites occupied by members of different tribes who are wealthier than the agent;
- The reward of each remaining site is given by the resource level at the site plus, if it is occupied, the minimum of a and the occupant's wealth;
- Throw out all sites that are vulnerable to retaliation; 
- Select the nearest position having maximum reward and go there;
- Gather the resources at the site plus the minimum of a and the occupant's wealth, if the site was occupied;
- If the site was occupied, then the former occupant is considered killed -- permanently removed from play.
