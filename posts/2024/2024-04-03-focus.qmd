## Definions

REPL
: Read-Eval-Print Loop - great for productivity.




## Challanges

1. creating stuff with LLM can be hard.
2. it requires focus
  1. as conversations expand the LLM loses focus
  2. its ourput can quickly overwhel.
3. automation 

One should develop a REPL like work environmonet.

The following is a sesies of prompts

> can you help me code a script that play's back a Wikipedia article's edit history and commits it to git

> could we preserve the edit comment and the editor's name or IP if anonymous
  
> can we backdate each git edit's commit to its original date  ?

> can we add a sanitation function

> could we access git via GitPython rather than a shell command ?

> i want this to be a command line app.

> can we add a command line interface for the parameters and a progress bar ?

> To make your script more user-friendly and easier to share, let's create a requirements.txt file and a README.md file. Additionally, I'll explain how to modify the script to fetch all revisions while respecting rate limiting, which is crucial to avoid overwhelming the Wikipedia API.

> ok lets recap everything the readme should  be in markdown

> i want to use this with a python env and then add a git ignore

> now lets make the shell file with the path to the repo as ~/work/data/wiki_git_dump

> how can I tell of the script is working ?

> lets create a bash file to execute the script with all the setting and a rate limit of 500 requests per hour


I discovered that the code tried to get all the revisions then write to git
however eventualy I got to a working version


the llm should help with

1. orgenizing the spec
  - a requirement document
  - uml diagrams in D2/ mermaid/draw.io
1. writing the readme.md
1. writing the gitignore
1. walking us through the code but only when asked.
1. walking us through the WM api.
1. waling us thought git api.
1. adding a script to interact with the os for installation!
1. suggest sanitation tips


the following is my spec please use it to revise:


## Project spec:


1. the app goal is to play back a wikipedia's page edit history into a github repo. with the idea of using this in RL NLP data science projects with local storage rather than over the network.

requirements:

1. this is a command line app in python.
2. it should take the following parameters with the defaults indicated
  - path to a folder with a github repo 
  - hourly_rate 500
  - A get all flag - to get all revisions, default to true
  - L log flag defaults to true
  - T tqdm progress bar
  - the article/page to fetch
3. we should have able to get the source or the output (html)
4. we should have a revision_producer and revision_consumer.
  the producer requests 500 revisons pushes them into a queue then sleeps for 7.2 seconds
  the consumer for each revision 
    1. checks if the edit is in the repo 
    2. if not commits it to the repo.
5. we should preserve 
  - the revision id
  - the edit comment 
  - the editor's name or IP if anonymous
6. we should back date the articles edits
7. support interruption - if this process stops early we should be able to resume
8. if we run the script a second time it should only get revisions after the last edit's date

## Command-Line Tool Specification for Wikipedia Edit History Playback

### Goal

The goal of this command-line tool is to retrieve the edit history of a Wikipedia article and commit it to a Git repository, enabling local storage and utilization of the data for NLP and other data science projects.

### Requirements

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Python-based, with the following parameters:
  - `path_to_repo`: Path to the Git repository (default: `~/work/data/wiki_git_dump`)
  - `hourly_rate`: Hourly rate limit for Wikipedia API requests (default: 500)
  - `get_all`: Flag to retrieve all revisions (default: True)
  - `log`: Flag to enable logging (default: True)
  - `progress_bar`: Flag to display a progress bar (default: True)
  - `article`: Article title to fetch

- **Data Retrieval and Storage**:
  - Fetch revisions from Wikipedia API.
  - Store revisions in Git repository.
  - Preserve the following metadata:
    - Revision ID
    - Edit comment
    - Editor's name or IP address (if anonymous)

- **Temporal Accuracy**:
  - Backdate Git commits to the original edit dates.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Support interruption and resumption.
  - Handle duplicate revisions.

- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Wikipedia API's rate limit (default: 500 requests per hour).

- **Documentation and Packaging**:
  - Create a `README.md` file with usage instructions.
  - Create a `requirements.txt` file for necessary dependencies.
  - Provide a bash script to execute the tool with pre-defined settings.

### Usage

```bash
python wiki_edit_history_playback.py \\
--path_to_repo ~/work/data/wiki_git_dump \\
--hourly_rate 500 \\
--get_all True \\
--log True \\
--progress_bar True \\
--article \"Artificial Intelligence\"
```
