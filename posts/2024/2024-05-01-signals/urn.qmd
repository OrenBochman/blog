Let's create one of the most fundumental models in probability theory - the urn model.

Urn models go back to the 17th century and were first introduced in [@bernoulli1713ars] by [Jacob Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli) 
The urn model is a simple model that describes the process of drawing balls from an urn. The urn contains balls of different colors, and the goal is to study the probabilities of drawing balls of different colors.

Two text on urns models are [@johnson1977urn] and [@mahmoud2008polya]

The urn model is a simple model that describes the process of drawing balls from an urn. 

The urn contains balls of different colors, and the goal is to study the probabilities of drawing balls of different colors.

Although basic urn models can be represented with draws from well known distributions
an the urn model is useful concrete form for thinking about probability particularly
when implementing simple reinforcement learning algorithms or model with Bayesian updating.

Some more complex processess in probability theory can be set up as urn model
making this a useful model to understand.

When it comes to implementing agents, we can quickly set them up for 
reinforcement or Bayesian learning by equipping the agnet with such an urn model.

In python we can implement the urn model using a numpy array to represent the balls in the urn and their counts.



The basic operations of the urn model is to draw a ball from the urn and update the urn with the new ball counts.

basic operations:

- draw() draw a ball from the urn 


operations:

- we might want to draw n balls then observe how many were of a certain color
- we might want to draw n balls then update the urn with the new ball counts
- we might want to draw n balls without updateing the urn with new balls to capture the current distribution of balls.
- convert balls/weights to probabilities
- estimate probability of drawing a certain sequence of balls with or without updating the urn.
- given n observations of balls estimate the ball proportions and thier confidence intervals.




## Urn Models and distributions


- [x] The Bernoulli urn model - sampling with replacement from an urn with two balls of different colors yields a binomial distribution.
- [x] The Multinomial urn model - sampling with replacement from an urn with more than two balls of different colors yields a multinomial distribution.
- hypergeometric urn - sampling without replacement...
- urn with sampling with replacement and adding a new ball of the same color
- polya urn - when a ball is observed the urn is updated with the same color ball and a new ball of the same color
- beta-binomial when ever a ball is observed the urn is updated with the number of balls of the same color
- dirichlet
- hoppe urn - the urn has a mutator ball that generates new ball color (a new column) and a mutator state that generates new states (a new row)
    - derichlet process
    - chinee restaurant process 
- moran urn - like a polya urn but we a;sp remove a ball so that the total number of balls remains constant.

### Ehrenfest Urn Model

The Ehrenfest urn model is a simple model that describes the process of moving balls between two urns. I view this as a precursor to compartmental models in epidemiology and other fields and it demostrates how one can extend the urn model can be used to model more complex systems. The more general model is the multiurn model where we have multiple urns and we can move balls between them which is a Markov chain model.


The model consists of two urns, each containing a fixed number of balls. At each time step, a ball is randomly selected from one of the urns and moved to the other urn.

## The MultiUrn model

> "any problem of probability appears comparable to a suitable problem about bags containing balls, and any random mass phenomenon appears
as similar in certain essential respects to successive drawings of balls from a system of suitibly combined bags." - @polya1954patterns

So I actualy implemented this model first to do some basic RL algorithms for the Lewis Signalling model.

The MultiUrn model is an extension of the basic Urn model that allows for multiple urns to be used together.

We may for example need to learn an urn model per state in our system extending
a bandit algorithm to a contextual bandit algorithm.

We can represent these using rows of a matrix where each row represents an urn
and each column represents a ball color.

In cases where we have hierarchical models we may be able to use additional constraints - for example on both rows and columns to speed up learning.

          if the reciever_signal is the same as the sender_signal
            result += p_sender * p_reciever
return result

# note I think the expected reward could be less then one - since the expected reward is the probability of the reciever signal given the sender signal

and sum of probabilities of the reciever signal given the sender signal is less then one.
      
      
        calculate the expected reward
        add the expected reward to the urn
where we start with a reciever, chose 


```{python}

expected_reward = s_urn.calculate_expected_reward(r_urn)/(s_urn.num_rows*r_urn.num_cols*s_urn.num_rows*r_urn.num_cols)
