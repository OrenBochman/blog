> Matrix games like Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma have guided research on social dilemmas for decades. 
  However, they necessarily treat the choice to cooperate or defect as an atomic action.
  In real-world social dilemmas these choices are temporally extended. 
  Cooperativeness is a property that applies to policies, not elementary actions. 
  We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure 
  of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn policies that 
  implement their strategic intentions. 
  We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested 
  independent learning agents, each using its own deep Qnetwork, on two Markov games we introduce here: 
  1. a fruit Gathering game and
  2. a Wolfpack hunting game. 
  We characterize how learned behavior in each domain changes as a function of 
  environmental factors including resource abundance. 
  Our experiments show how conflict can emerge from competition over shared 
  resources and shed light on how the sequential nature of real world social 
  dilemmas affects cooperation." -- [@Leibo2017marl] abstract

Initially at least it seems to me that the "sequential social dilemma" 
is just an analog of an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. 
This game considered the basis of all other social dilemmas has been treated at great 
length in [@Axelrod1980] and [@Axelrod1997] with the famous Axelrod tournaments. 
Some interesting results include the fact that the best strategy in the tournament
was the simplest. Population dynamics are such that in population of agents with
one strategy, the introduction of new agents with a different strategy can gain
a foothold and cause the dominant strategy in the population to switch to the new strategy. 
This is known as the "evolution of cooperation".

This work led to a growing interest in the study of cooperation in non-cooperative games
with about 300 new papers published on the topic in the 10 years following the publication.

Later work looked at the robustness of the
winning strategies in the Axelrod tournaments, see [@Nowak2004].

# Introduction

In [@Leibo2017marl], the authors introduce a new class of social dilemmas, 
called sequential social dilemmas, which are inspired by the classic matrix
game social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma.
