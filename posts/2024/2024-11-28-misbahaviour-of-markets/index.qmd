One of the most popular books for quants is "The (Mis)behaviour of Markets" [@mandelbrot2010mis]. This is more a popular science book than a technical tome with relatively less math and some fascinating figures. The book was his last book published in 2004 and is based on lots of research. As far as I can tell the most pertinent was a paper titled Scaling in financial markets that came out in four parts just three years before the book in 2001. The papers are:

![multifractal landscape](./cover.webp){#fig-multifractal .column-margin fig-alt="A highly detailed multifractal landscape showcasing rugged mountains, intricate valleys, and diverse natural features. The terrain exhibits self-similarity at different scales, with patterns of varying complexity blending seamlessly. The landscape has vivid textures, sharp contrasts, and includes lush greenery, rocky cliffs, and flowing rivers. The sky above is clear with dynamic cloud formations, complementing the fractal nature of the terrain. The scene is rendered in a realistic style to emphasize the mathematical and natural beauty of the multifractal patterns." }

These are very interesting papers but like much of Mandelbrot's work they are not easy to read. More so as he tend to quote from his earlier in extensive detail while preferring to avoid the literature of by others to the chagrin of his contemporaries, making it harder to follow the argument.

I have read them and will try to summarize them in a way that is more accessible. I will also try to provide some context and background to the papers and provide a few lighthearted podcasts that discuss the papers and the book.

Also I was interested in reproducing some of the work from the book but instead I think I can make use of some code released by others. That came out  in the last few year since I read the book. The point is that these ideas can be applied to time series modeling.

So what are multifractals? Although multifractals are rooted in probability, much of the related literature comes from the physics and mathematics arena. Here is one definition:

> A multifractal system is a generalization of a fractal system in which a single exponent (the fractal dimension) is not enough to describe its dynamics; instead, a continuous spectrum of exponents (the so-called singularity spectrum) is needed. --- [@harte2001multifractals]
