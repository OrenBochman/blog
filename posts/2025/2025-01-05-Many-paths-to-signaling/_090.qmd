## Babylon Consensus

Multiple senders and receivers take shelter in common ground and need to arrive at a common signaling system.

1. They can want to learn the least costly signaling system in terms of learning.
2. They want to learn the most salient signaling system in terms of the distribution of states.
    3. There is an agent who knows the current distribution of states and the optimal signaling system. 
    4. There isn't such an agent but the senders want to use a

### Cost of learning a second dialect


1. for each agent and for each signal that is different from the target signalaling system add a cost of 1.

$$
C = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \delta_{ij} \\
$$ {#eq-cost}

where $\delta_{ij}$ is 1 if the signal $j$ is different from the target signal for state $i$ and 0 otherwise.
