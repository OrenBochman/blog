> The Garden of Forking Paths --- Jorge Luis Borges

There are many ways for signaling systems to emerge. Gold's theorem even suggests that if one makes a few assumptions there are scenarios that emergent languages become a garden with infinitely bifurcating paths each leading to a different language, and that the sender and receiver may never be sure they are on the same wavelength. While I consider these scenarios unrealistic, I do believe that the garden of forking paths is more than a metaphor for complex signaling systems.

Brian Skyrms - "Some Dynamics of Signaling Games" at he start of this Skyrms suggest that there are many games and mechanism in which signaling systems arise.

## The origin stories

Like so much of the work on signaling systems, most of the work and interpretation originated with Brian Skyrms. The more I made progress on this working paper the more I discovered that I was increasingly going over material published or review by Skyrms in [@skyrms2010signals] which I had read a number of times.

The real headache was that I was more interested in documenting my ideas, but I had to give credit to the many other researchers who had worked on signaling systems before me. In reality though most of the papers dive much deeper into the mathematics of signaling systems then I have. That is at least an advantage of finding the `origin stories` of the different dynamics.

## Motivations

Initially I just wanted to document ideas that came up while replicating some of the classic papers.

However, as I got deeper into complex signaling, I realized that assumption and intuition for the classic Lewis game often seem to reverse for the complex game. Thus ideas that I had considered trivial dynamics turned into stepping stones across the moat that separates simple and complex.

Also as I try to developed increasingly efficient RL algorithms for learning signaling systems I realized that I was not the only one working on this problem. It was a again a good idea to track the different ideas that seem to work and to check if others had already discovered them.

In the talk above and earlier in the bibliography of his book a large body of research deals with the emergence of signaling systems. There are many others that have worked on this problem as well and it seems that in many cases researchers in different fields are ignorant of the work of others, use different terminology and tools. THis makes tracking things all the more challanging. Skryms mentions work from

- Evolutionary biology
- Economics deal with signaling between enteties like in auctions.
- Networks of signaling agents

more recently there is also a growing number of papers coming from the AI community. 

- Emergent Languages in AI and MARL

Motivation:

Now besides wanting to organize the literature my interests evolved over time. I became more interested in complex signaling, more agents, use of networks, how it might be useful in RL and MARL.

With the advent of LLMs into the field of RL and robotics (AKA continuous control) the power of natural language to plan robotics tasks based on common sense reasoning, suggests that one key to Transfer learning might lay in the ability of agents to learn representations that can be shared across different tasks.

This can emerge but I now believe that it could be engineered or perhapes nuged in such a way that the emergent languages capture a representation of the world that would be useful for transfer learning to other highly capable agents.


I discoverd a number of these mechanism independently while trying replicate and improve RL and Bayesian algorithms for learning signaling systems. However watching the video above led me to realize that this is a relatively small space and that many people have approached it from different angles. It also seems unlikely that I can cover all of the different mechanisms in this article. So I now hope to mention the main mechanism and perhaps the papers that give them some in depth treatments. And I plan to dive deeper into the ones that I have worked on.

I also want to give credit to the many other researchers who have worked on signaling systems. I have not read all of thier work but I have read some of it and I have tried to include it in the bibliography.

After taking some course on RL I also began to consider these in terms of different RL settings.

Although the Lewis signaling game, c.f. [@lewis1969convention] is touted as a mechanism for the emergence of language, [@skyrms2010signals] and others suggest different ways that this can take place, including evolution and reinforcement learning. In many cases languages emerges by spontaneous symmetry breaking  but in other cases a language creator may wear the hat of an engineer. The point is that small changes can have both large or nuanced impact on the languages that arise.

Most of these are from my own thinking but the more I delve into the literature the more I realize that these and many others have been considered by others as well. Accordingly I'll try and add citations, however this is less a literature review and more an exercise in understanding how we may one day get agents to quickly learn to communicate effectively in a broad spectrum of different settings. As such I also consider some cases where the outcomes are less than stellar and what one might want to avoid.

## TL;DR {.unnumbered}

![Emergent Languages in](/images/in_the_nut_shell_coach_retouched.jpg)

One fascinating aspect the Lewis signaling game [@lewis1969convention] is that although there are many theoretical equilibria initially the agents will inevitably fail to coordinate and they can only reach the optimal signaling systems after some iterations of the game in which they either evolve or use reinforcement learning to coordinate a themselves to a common signaling strategy. In the prisoners dilemma agents can learn to cooperate if the game is iterated. In the Lewis signaling game agents can learn to coordinate on a signaling system if the game is iterated.

Generally to find a good signaling system requires some kind of algorithm and at least between N and $N^2$ steps as well some number of iterations. I don't recall seeing a discussion of the the minimum or the expected number of iterations required to reach a signaling system under different algorithms. In other words most researchers have considered the complexity of coordination in signaling systems. This is actually a fairly simple problem to solve in the most common settings.
:::

Another two point primarily addressed by the evolutionary game theory community who view evolution in terms of replicator dynamics is that of stability of equilibria and the notions of evolutionary stable strategies.

The first has to do with convergence of learning to an optimal signaling system.

The second has to do with the ability of an equilibrium to resist invasion by a mutant strategy.

### Enumerating the different type of signaling systems and the other types of equilibria.

A related issues is that of enumerating different types of equilibria in larger games. For basic Lewis Signaling games this is not very difficult as there are N! signaling systems in games with N signals and N states,

For a complex signaling system with N states and M signals we can enumerate the signals as the first N base M numbers. Once again we deal with N! permutations. However the sender may chose any set of base N base M numbers. This creates an potentially unbounded number of signaling systems. This is perhaps a reflection of Wilhelm von Humboldt characterization of "infinite use of finite means" meaning that a language as systems in which a finite number of symbols can be combined in an unbounded number of ways, c.f. [@von1999humboldt]

This perhaps makes the complex signaling game special as a game theoretic problem. At least in the sense of what we consider bounded rationality. It is not at all clear what solution concept could be used to create an optimal signaling system, in this case it should require deep insights into group theory, topology, information theory, category theory, probability theory. Also though I consider the problem of equilibria in terms of an enumeration of states via numeric signals, it is does not at all follow that this is the best way to consider the problem. If we use a an alphabet of M phonemes we may for instance run into phonotactic constraints that are not at all present in the numeric representation. Thus another source of complexity may arise in terms of the actual realization of the signaling system. This is perhaps why this needs to be a working paper -- in which new ideas can be added as they come to me.

For complex signaling systems we need to consider

1.  Are the infinite number of signaling systems equivalent up to an isomorphism? I believe that the answer to this is yes by the following rationale. Any signaling system can be viewed as a permutation of signals to states. And according to the Cayley's theorem any groups can be represented as a permutation. Hence we can view any complex signaling system as some group! And groups are equivalent if they are related by a group homomorphism. However there are still a couple of conundrums to consider. If the prelinguistic objects we call the states have a group structure and this is preserved this seems like a signaling systems that is a faithful representation. But it is also possible that there is a mismatch - that some of the structure is lost or that some additional structure in the language is added that is not in the original pre linguistic objects. I think that some of these might be viewed as happy accident while others may be failures in therms of signaling systems.
2.  Can the Lewis signaling game together with the pre-linguistic object imbue the language with semantics ?
3.  At what point can we view signaling systems universal in terms of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. I.e. when does the semantics of the signaling system becomes capable of representing the semantics of any natural language?

IT is entirely possible to

Another point of interest to me is to consider the emergence of grammar and of a morphology. In [@nowak1999evolution] The authors give a result for the emergence of grammar in a signaling system. This is that there are many more

I think it worth while to list them in this space --- particularly as I believe that signaling systems are a key for transfer learning in reinforcement learning which together with learning to represent complex states may be the key to AGI.

## Introduction

-   Listing number of different scenarios on how signaling systems can arise in the Lewis signaling games.
-   I will start with a story
-   Next add some details like some variants and look some basic analysis.
-   Finally I'll try to place it into the context of MARL. Note that we will be dealing with partially observed multi agent RL. But each scenario can have a different setting.

In The book signals [@skyrms2010signals] the author, Skyrms, discusses how Lewis challenged the skepticism of his advisor Quine regarding the meaning and convention may arise via an arbitrary mechanism like symmetry breaking.

When I considered solving some additional issues surrounding the fundamentals of signaling systems I realized that I had a few different scenarios in mind and that writing them down with some semblance of formalism might be helpful. It turns out that indeed this turns out to be a stepping stone towards developing an optimal algorithms for learning signaling system in different RL settings.

Let's face it under different settings the task of acquiring a signaling system can be easier or harder. In [@skyrms2010signals] the author points out that at symmetry breaking all the different signaling systems that could be learned are equivalent. However if there is an asymmetry in the form of a non-uniform distribution of states or different signaling risks then we we might prefer some signaling systems over others and there might even be a unique optimal signaling system. Furthermore like in reality one would expect that with time distributions of states might change and the optimal signaling system might change as well.
