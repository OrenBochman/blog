### Story: Ship of Fools

Senders and Receivers lack all prior knowledge. They follow an optimal strategy for a related game the battle of the sexes.
Is a state is uncoordinated senders will explore  randomly pick a signal and receivers will randomly pick an action until they get a reward and exclude the signal action pair from exploration.

:::

This strategy is not the best one for senders, but it is easier to analyze.

If the state is T and there are N states, signals and actions then are $N\times N$ choices for sender and recievers of which the ones with action A=T get a reward. So the expected reward is 1/N chance of getting a reward. 

The expected rewards are 1/N but since the sender is randomizing each turn is independent. Can they do better?
