## The Guru's Prior

The Sender is a privileged elder who knows the distribution of the states, the associated risk and cost of signaling to sender and receiver and figures our the optimal signaling systems. As such he selects a specific signaling system. This means that students need to coordinate to this system.

-   This means that whenever the state $s_i$ arises we will get signal $sig_i=Send(s_i)$ rather then some random signal. This means that the student for a mistake the *receiver* can use a negative reinforcement for $<sig_i,action_j>$ is the return is 0. This should allow the receiver to narrow down the actions chosen for the next time we he gets that signal.

This is second hardest learning scenario but also most realistic. We don't want to have to learn a new language for every person we meet.

What could happen - the distribution of states could evolve over time.
