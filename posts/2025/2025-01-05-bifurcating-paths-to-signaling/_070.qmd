## The prophet's prior

The sender knows the distribution of the states and how it evolves over time. He choses the currently optimal signaling system. The receivers must learn the signaling system but once a change in the state distribution is observed they will switch to the the new optimal signaling system.

Imagine a world with many predators troubling the signaler. To avoid becoming prey agents must send a risky signals to their neighbors. They should use the signaling with the least expected cost. This cost combines the predator risk and its frequency. Signals can be 1 or 0. 1 is risky and 0 is safe. As frequency of the predators change the optimal signaling system will change as well.
