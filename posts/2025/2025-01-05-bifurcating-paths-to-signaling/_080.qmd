## The Gurus' Posterior

Here there are multiple gurus with knowledge of different distribution. Can they coordinate on the most salient signaling system with respect to thier common knowledge ? 

This should be the signaling system that is most salient for a mixture distribution with weight $w_i$ for each guru.

Lets perhaps assume that there are a very large N and a cutoff $\epsilon$ probability for which the gurus won't bother to include rare sates.


In the second setting two or more students must come up with any signaling systems as fast as possible.
