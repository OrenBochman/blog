Question: how can we use planning in the Lewis Signaling Game.

Question: When is the RL update rule a regression ? [Something I heard explained in a couple of talks.]

Question: If I take some problems that can be solved with dynamic programming, does tha mean (tabular) RL algs should be able to solve them?

Question: In the Lewis signaling game, how can we test the robustness of an equilibrium? What are the factors that affect the stability of the equilibrium?

Questions: In the lewis signaling game, how does the distribution of state relate to the stability or robustness of the equilibrium
