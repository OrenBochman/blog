## Decodeability - Easy to decode 


### Overview

Complex signaling systems should be easy to decode. 
This is a property of prefix codes.
Huffman coding has this property. 

It is worthwhile considering huffman coding as a working model for the evolution of signaling systems.

### Insights from Natural Language

Are natural languages easy to decode?
Parsing natural language is a difficult task is challenging for machines but not so much for humans.

### Metrics

Ease of decoding is likely an information theoretic property and should have metrics that are associated with the complexity of the decoding process.
