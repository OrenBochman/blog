title: "Updates to the github action"
---

In the last few dates I made some updates to the blog, cleaning things up but it broke down.

Today it is back to speed and I think it might useful for other quarto bloggers to look at my current github action as I made a couple of changes to the initial script.

```yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

github action

```yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Install R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.5.1'

      # Install system deps needed by R packages (curl in particular)
      - name: Install system libraries
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
            libcurl4-openssl-dev \
            libssl-dev \
            libxml2-dev \
            libicu-dev \
            zlib1g-dev \
            pkg-config \
            build-essential \
            gfortran \
            cmake

      # # Install LaTeX for PDF output
      # - name: Install latex

      #       texlive-latex-recommended \
      #       texlive-latex-extra \
      #       texlive-fonts-recommended

      - name: Install R Dependencies
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
        with:
          cache-version: 1

      - name: Install Python and Dependencies
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10.12'
          cache: 'pip'
      - run: pip install jupyter
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Where the latest addition are the Install system libraries section.
