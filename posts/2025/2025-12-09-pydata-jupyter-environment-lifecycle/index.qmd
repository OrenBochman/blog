## Lecture Overview

Most data science projects start with a simple notebook—a spark of curiosity, some exploration, and a handful of promising results. But what happens when that experiment needs to grow up and go into production?

This talk follows the story of a single machine learning exploration that matures into a full-fledged ETL pipeline. We’ll walk through the practical steps and real-world challenges that come up when moving from a Jupyter notebook to something robust enough for daily use.

## What You'll Learn:

-   **Set clear objectives** and document the process from the beginning
-   **Break messy notebook logic** into modular, reusable components
-   **Choose the right tools** (Papermill, nbconvert, shell scripts) based on your workflow—not just the hype
-   **Track environments and dependencies** to make sure your project runs tomorrow the way it did today
-   **Handle data integrity**, schema changes, and even evolving labels as your datasets shift over time
-   And as a bonus: **bring your results to life** with interactive visualizations using tools like [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/), [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila), and [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) + [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/)

![Agenda - Setting objectives](slide05.png)


-   (3 mins) Intro
    -   I've been supporting various groups in their developer experience since 2020 after being a freelance Python consultant. I've worked on many many dozens of projects, unblocking users picking the right tools for the task at hand.
    -   It works on my machine
    -   [What we're building today: ML pipeline ➰ with 🌊RAPIDS $\to$ Snowflake ❄️]{.marked}
    -   We're going to watch a real project grow up

![Setting objectives - Domain problems and scope](slide06.png)

-   Before you start coding you should have a team discussion to set objectives.
-   Specify the problem domain and the project's scope
-   Brainstorm before coding

![Setting objectives 1](slide07.png)

-   Kickoff meeting to discuss the above with stakeholders
-   Dependency matrix
-   [RACI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) is **responsibility assignment matrix for cross departmental projects**
    -   Responsible - stakeholders are involved in the planning, execution, and completion of the task.
    -   Acountable - stakeholders are held to be individually and ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the task
    -   Consulted - Consulted stakeholders are sought for their opinions on a task;
    -   Informed - Informed stakeholders are updated as the project progresses.

![Agenda - Modular Notbooks](slide10.png)

Next we cover Modular Notebook use.

-   (3 mins) Exploration - starting as a single messy notebook, sample data set.
    -   Why RAPIDS? GPU
        -   Large data sets
        -   GPU availability - remote machine, local GPU
        -   Workflows that work well with GPU
    -   Load Data cuDF / pandas
    -   Quick EDA and data visualization
    -   Train cuML / scikit-learn model
    -   No-code change philosophy

![Modular Notebooks](slide11.png)

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## TOOL TIP - RAPIDS

- [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) is "GPU Accelerated Data Science"
- Built on top of Nvidia CUDA and Apache Arrow 
- Uses familier APIs but powered by GPU libraries. 
    - Pandas api for CUDF
    - SCIKIT-LEARN api for CUML 
    - Polars api for CUDF
    - NetworkX api for CUGRAPH
- Vector search with CUVS
- Zero Code Changes (i.e. just change your imports) to get  and 5x to 500x speedups.
- FOSS [repo](https://github.com/rapidsai)
- [Install guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/install/)
- [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/user-guide)

![ETL & Feature Engineering](slide12.png)

- ML require Exctact Transform Load
- Takes raw data into the data store
- Feature Engineering

![Builder Pattern](slide13.png)

-   I like this slide and I like the builder pattern.
-   It shows how to break down a complex process into manageable steps.

![SKLEARN](slide14.png)

- Sklearn Base modules 
    - scale more effectively 🙏
    - find problematic code more easily 🤬😵‍💫🤦‍♂️
    - have a more enjoyable developer experience 🤕
        - 😟😞😫 work with apocrypha bugs🤒 that don't get fixed and learn about them from the gravepine or the hardway
        - 😒😏🤨 read about undocumented parameters and algs by a bibtex reference name instead of a citation!
        - 🧗🧱🧊 import tons of external libs for algs that haven't made the cut!
-   We can use sklearn pipelines to chain together multiple steps in a machine learning workflow.
-   This makes it easy to reuse and modify our code.

## Further Reading

-   Speaker Recommends:

    -   Softeware architecture design patterns in Python by Parth Detroja, Neel Mehta, Aditya Agashe
    -   Data engineering with Python by Paul Crickard

## My Reflection

The speaker rubbed me the wrong way at first, however I soon realized that she was just stretching herself beyond her comfort zone and not only had a beautiful slide deck but also many valuable insights and tools to share.


- Main takeaways:
    - look at RAPIDS ^[it has many great tools!]
    - Use builder patter in ETL! ^[or don't Matt Harrison shows us how to chain ETL code like a pro!]
    - PAPERMILL & MLflow can take notebooks to another level (think)
    - Think about converting NB to production
