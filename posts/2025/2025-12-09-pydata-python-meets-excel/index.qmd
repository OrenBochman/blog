## Lecture Overview

Python drives modern data workflows, yet Excel remains the lingua franca of business. Many Python-based data teams struggle when the “last mile” of delivery still involves exporting results to Excel for business users. This talk explores practical ways for Python users to automate, scale, and enhance Excel-heavy processes using open-source libraries.
This talk will help you bridge the gap between code and the business-facing spreadsheet world.
We will discuss real-world use cases for report generation, batch processing, and dashboard templating, all from a Python-first perspective.

:::


This talk is designed for Python developers, analysts, and data scientists who routinely interact with Excel-based deliverables in their organization. It focuses on practical workflows that enhance productivity and reproducibility without requiring the audience to write or understand VBA or Excel formulas.


The session begins by outlining common challenges Python users face when integrating with Excel, then introduces powerful Python tools that offer users seamless Excel file manipulation, specifically pandas, xlsxwriter, and xlwings.

We will discuss some real-world use cases, such as generating reports, automating dashboards, creating custom functions in Excel and batch processing Excel files at scale.

The talk concludes with a summary of tools, limitations, and best practices for integrating Python into Excel-centric workflows. This is a conceptual and strategic talk aimed at helping Python professionals work more effectively with Excel natives in the business ecosystem
