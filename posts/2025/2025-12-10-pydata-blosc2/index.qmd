## Lecture Overview

As datasets grow, I/O becomes a primary bottleneck, slowing down scientific computing and data analysis. This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to Blosc2, a powerful meta-compressor designed to turn I/O-bound workflows into CPU-bound ones. We will move beyond basic compression and explore how to structure data for high-performance computation.

Participants will learn to use the python-blosc2 library to compress and decompress data with various codecs and filters, optimizing for speed and ratio. The core of the tutorial will focus on the Blosc2 NDArray object, a chunked, N-dimensional array that lives on disk or in memory. Through a series of interactive exercises, you will learn how to perform out-of-core mathematical operations and analytics directly on compressed arrays, effectively handling datasets larger than available RAM.

We will also cover practical topics like data storage backends, two-level partitioning for faster data slicing, and how to integrate Blosc2 into existing NumPy-based workflows. You will leave this session with the practical skills needed to significantly accelerate your data pipelines and manage massive datasets with ease.

## Audience & Prerequisites:

This tutorial is for data scientists, engineers, and researchers who work with large numerical datasets in Python.

Prerequisites: Attendees should have intermediate Python programming skills and be comfortable with the basics of NumPy arrays. 
No prior experience with Blosc2 is necessary.

Setup: Participants will need a laptop and can follow along using a provided cloud-based environment (e.g., Binder) or a local installation of Python, Jupyter, and the python-blosc2 library.

## Tools and Frameworks:

We will introduce you to certain modern frameworks in the workshop but the emphasis be on first principles and using vanilla Python and LLM calls to build AI-powered systems.

### Francesc Alted

I am a curious person who studied Physics (BSc, MSc) and Applied Maths (MSc). I spent over a year at CERN for my MSc in High Energy Physics. However, I found maths and computer sciences equally fascinating, so I left academia to pursue these fields. Over the years, I developed a passion for handling large datasets and using compression to enable their analysis on commodity hardware accessible to everyone.

I am the CEO of ironArray SLU and also leading the Blosc Development Team, and currently interested in determining, ahead of time, which combinations of codecs and filters can provide a personalized compression experience. I am also very excited in providing a way for sharing Blosc2 datasets in the network in an easy and effective way via Caterva2, and Cat2Cloud, a software as a service for handling and computing with datasets directly in the cloud.

As an Open Source believer, I started the PyTables project more than 20 years ago. After 25 years in this business, I started several other useful open source projects like Blosc2, Caterva2 and Btune; those efforts won me two prizes that mean a lot to me:

2023: NumFOCUS Project Sustainability Award
2017: Google’s Open Source Peer Bonus
