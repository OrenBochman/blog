## Lecture Overview

The proliferation of AI/ML workloads across commercial enterprises, necessitates robust mechanisms to track, inspect and analyze their use of on-prem/cloud infrastructure. To that end, effective insights are crucial for optimizing cloud resource allocation with increasing workload demand, while mitigating cloud infrastructure costs and promoting operational stability.

This talk will outline an approach to systematically monitor, inspect and analyze AI/ML workloads’ properties like runtime, resource demand/utilization and cost attribution tags . By implementing granular inspection across multi-player teams and projects, organizations can gain actionable insights into resource bottlenecks, identify opportunities for cost savings, and enable AI/ML platform engineers to directly attribute infrastructure costs to specific workloads.
:::

Cost attribution of infrastructure usage by AI/ML workloads focuses on key metrics such as compute node group information, cpu usage seconds, data transfer, gpu allocation , memory and ephemeral storage utilization. It enables platform administrators to identify competing workloads which lead to diminishing ROI. Answering questions from data scientists like "Why did my workload run for 6 hours today, when it took only 2 hours yesterday" or "Why did my workload start 3 hours behind schedule?" also becomes easier.

Through our work on Metaflow, we will showcase how we built a comprehensive framework for transparent usage reporting, cost attribution, performance optimization, and strategic planning for future AI/ML initiatives. 
Metaflow is a human centric python library that enables seamless scaling and management of AI/ML projects.

Ultimately, a well-defined usage tracking system empowers organizations to maximize the return on investment from their AI/ML endeavors while maintaining budgetary control and operational efficiency.

## What You'll Learn:

Platform engineers and administrators will be able to gain insights into the following operational aspects of supporting a battle hardened ML Platform:

1. Optimize resource allocation: Understand consumption patterns to right-size clusters and allocate resources more efficiently, reducing idle time and preventing bottlenecks.

2. Proactively manage capacity: Forecast future resource needs based on historical usage trends, ensuring the infrastructure can scale effectively with increasing workload demand.

3. Facilitate strategic planning: Make informed decisions regarding future infrastructure investments and scaling strategies.

4. Diagnose workload execution delays: Identify resource contention, queuing issues, or insufficient capacity leading to delayed workload starts.

Data Scientists on the other hand will gain clarity on factors that influence workload performance. Tuning them can lead to efficiencies in runtime and associated cost profiles.

## Tools and Frameworks:

- [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/): A human-centric Python framework that streamlines the development and deployment of AI/ML projects, enabling seamless scaling and management of workflows.

This abstract proposes a framework for systematically monitoring and analyzing AI/ML workloads to optimize resource utilization and effective cost attribution/management. By providing granular insights into resource consumption, the system helps identify cloud infra bottlenecks - leading to lower resource contention while promoting fairer use of resources. Built on Metaflow, this approach enables transparent usage reporting, improved performance, and strategic planning for future AI/ML initiatives. Ultimately, it empowers organizations to maximize ROI from their AI/ML investments while maintaining budgetary control and operational efficiency for both platform engineers and data scientists.

### Saurabh Garg

He is currently focused on building a frictionless Machine Learning Platform at Outerbounds, where our mission is to let data scientists and ML engineers stay focused on AI/ML development—while we manage the infrastructure that powers it.

My background is in large-scale distributed systems, with experience spanning cloud infrastructure and identity/authorization systems. I've worked on infrastructure teams at Oracle Cloud and Outerbounds, and on IAM/authorization platforms at Atlassian and Databricks.

At Atlassian, I was part of the team that built a CQRS-based permissions system deployed across six AWS regions, handling 100K+ read requests with sub-3ms P99 latencies.

At Databricks, I founded and led a 6-engineer team focused on authorization. We transitioned the platform from a monolithic client-based model to a service-oriented architecture, integrating with ~35 internal services and achieving P99 latencies under 1 second for over 10K requests per second.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy spending time with my daughter, and I'm always up for a game of cricket or table tennis.
