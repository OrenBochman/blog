## Lecture Overview

Your model might pass all the benchmarks—but can it survive a subpoena? In the race to ship AI, most teams are building workflows that look great in dashboards but fall apart under legal, regulatory, or ethical pressure. Because the real liability doesn’t live in your model weights—it’s buried in your data.
:::

This session is a reality check for anyone shipping machine learning in production. We’ll walk through the dark corners of modern ML pipelines: mutable datasets with no history, mystery data sources with missing labels, and a forgotten column of PII that’s just been shipped to production. Then we’ll show how to fix it—without turning your data team into compliance officers.

You’ll learn how to embed reproducibility, traceability, and policy enforcement into your pipeline without slowing it to a crawl: track every dataset change, version every experiment, validate against policy gates, and generate audit trails that actually mean something. Whether you’re dealing with GDPR, HIPAA, or just not wanting to get roasted by internal audit, this talk gives you the blueprint for ML you can defend in court—and still ship on time.

## What You'll Learn:

- 🔍 A walkthrough of key components: attention, positional encoding, encoder/decoder stack
- 🧠 Visual explanations of attention masks, shapes, and residuals
- ⚠️ Common bugs and debugging strategies (like handling shape mismatches and masking errors)
- ✅ Real-world implementation tips and tricks that demystify the architecture

By the end of the talk, attendees will:

- Understand the full forward pass of a transformer
- Know how each component connects to the original paper
- Feel more confident reading or writing custom model architectures

## Prerequisites:

- Basic Python and PyTorch
- Some familiarity with neural networks (e.g., feedforward, softmax)
- No need for prior experience in building models from scratch

## Tools and Frameworks:

We will introduce you to certain modern frameworks in the workshop but the emphasis be on first principles and using vanilla Python and LLM calls to build AI-powered systems.

## Reflections

This is not the first time I see the concept of data version cotrol c.f. [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/).

However here we see a more comprehensive approach that includes not only data versioning but also experiment tracking, policy validation, and audit trail generation. This holistic view is crucial for building robust ML pipelines that can withstand legal and regulatory scrutiny.
