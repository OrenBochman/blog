This post covers a second ABM model for demand
This model uses mesa and shinylive for python.


The second model uses mesa + shinylive + altair-viz.

But more significantly it uses a Polya urn model to model preferences over products. And the products come from a Hoppe urn model which is closely related to the Chinese Restaurant Process.

The outcome is still a preliminary model of demand. In the next installment I wish to add a negative feedback mechanism to the model so that agents can use thier happiness as a measure of thier welfare to adjust thier purchasing decisions to be more in line with thier budget constraint.

Currently the products follow a Hoppe urn model which is closely related to the Chinese Restaurant Process. The Hoppe urn model I implemented below is based on the generlised polya urn model, meaning that we can addjust the rate of innovation.

I point this out since in most runs the number of products grows increasingly slowly tapering our at 8 after 100 steps. This is one of the two things I track in this model. The second is the preferences of each agent over the products. The initial setting only shows a few agents and their preferences are not so different.
But when I pick say 40 agents things get dramatically different and we see a much more diverse set of preferences evolving.

This also suggest a second direction for generalization of the model - looking at aggregation from different population segments (sorted by income or by similar preferences?).

Further work on this specific model is to see how demand aggregates as we get more agents.


Further work on other models are broken into 

- adding a budget constraint and a negative feedback loop to get agents to adjust thier purchasing decisions based on thier happiness (utility) and thier budget constraint.
- adding segregation to get local markets.
- adding product categories and affinity between products, allowing us to model substitutes and complements. 
- Associating products with hierarchy similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This should help partition the preference into hard and soft preferences. (Needs vs wants) with multiple levels of wants. This should be a smal tree. I think a nested CRP may be a good model for this. Or a Pitman-Yor process to keep the levels of the tree small. Within the model we want to be able to also have categories of products. In each categories are substitutes and sub-categories.



Some questions I will address in future posts is how to translate preferences into buying patterns for individual agents.

1. How many products will an agent buy given a budget constraint? (The ideal and quick approximation
2. Given relative preferences and actual price how much of each product should the agent buy? I recall chicago price theory has the derivations for this in the first two lectures.
3. This leads to a high dimensional convex optimization problem. How can we solve this efficiently? 
4. Alternatively we can use importance sampling to generate a large collection of possible baskets. An approach similar to monte carlo tree search can be used to find the best basket. I like this direction as more complex models may not be so easy to solve empirically.

### Two NonParametric Helper Models (Polya Urn and Hoppe Urn)

class PolyaUrn:

       Note: 
    
       - Since products are generated by a CRP process (Hoppe Urn), we need to support adding new products via a draw_new_product() method.

       - We may consider using Moran steps to model a drift from many products to a few products, i.e. we draw a ball replacing it with a ball of another color based on the urn's diriclet distribution.
       or we may drift according to some exogenous process. e.g. advertising or social influence. We may do this once or until
       we converge to some top-k products.


    Attributes:
        alpha (float): The reinforcement parameter.
        num_products (int): The number of products (colors).
        urn (Dict[int, int]): A dictionary representing the urn with product indices as keys and bead counts as values.

       We will later extend this to support the addition of product categories and affinity between products, allowing us to model substitutes and complements.
