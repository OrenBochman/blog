## Lecture Overview

The modern Python ecosystem shortens the distance between idea and implementation. This talk presents a focused workflow to move from a business question to a working prototype, fast. We'll explore reproducible environments (`uv`, `Docker`), quick data iteration with `polars` and `duckdb`, clean project scaffolding (pyproject.toml), and lightweight service layers with `FastAPI` and `pydantic`. Along the way, we’ll integrate tests (`pytest`), static checks (`mypy`), and fast linting (`ruff`). You’ll leave with a reusable structure, toolchain recommendations, and a mental model for optimizing feedback loops and development in modern Python projects.

This talk outlines a practical, opinionated workflow for building real things quickly using modern Python without relying on heavy frameworks or over-engineering.

- Core idea:

    - The shortest path from notebook to usable component is a repeatable, well-lit toolchain with the right structure.

## What You'll Learn:

- 🪜 Scaffold a clean project using `pyproject.toml`, deterministic environments (uv), and lightweight automation (e.g. Makefile or CLI scripts).
- 🔍 Explore data rapidly with polars and duckdb, capturing the business logic in small, testable functions.
- 🎀 Wrap the logic in a minimal FastAPI app with pydantic validation, creating clean contracts and boundaries.
- ✚ Add fast feedback mechanisms: tests with pytest, type safety via mypy, and low-friction code hygiene using ruff and pre-commit.
- 📦 Package a handoff-friendly interface (command-line entrypoints, minimal docs) for teammates or deployment pipelines.

This talk isn’t a showcase of cutting-edge libraries. It’s a field guide on how to leverage modern Python tools and fostering repeatable software engineering habits to maximize value delivery.

You’ll leave with:

- 🗺️ A blueprint for rapid iteration.
- 🔄 Reusable patterns for API-bound prototyping.
- 🧠 A mindset that treats reproducibility as a first-class concern.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic Python (functions, environments), familiarity with DataFrame operations, and HTTP/JSON fundamentals.
:::

## Tools and Frameworks:

We will introduce you to certain modern frameworks in the workshop but the emphasis be on first principles and using vanilla Python and LLM calls to build AI-powered systems.
