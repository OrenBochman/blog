<p>Traditional methods of computer vision and machine learning cannot match human performance on tasks such as the recognition of handwritten digits or traffic signs. Our biologically plausible deep artificial neural network architectures can. Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winner-take-all neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the first to achieve near-human performance. On a traffic sign recognition benchmark it outperforms humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a plethora of common image classification benchmarks. — <span class="citation" data-cites="cireşan2012multicolumndeepneuralnetworks">(Cireşan, Meier, and Schmidhuber 2012)</span></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-contributions">Key Contributions</h2>
<p>The authors present a system that uses several deep neural networks, each operating as a “column,” which are trained independently. The outputs of these networks are then averaged to form the final prediction. This multi-column approach exploits the diversity between different networks and boosts classification accuracy, reducing the impact of overfitting and improving generalization. Notably, the method achieved state-of-the-art results on several image classification benchmarks at the time, including the MNIST digit recognition task.</p>
<p>One of the central contributions of this paper is the demonstration of how <mark>combining multiple deep networks can outperform single networks in complex image classification tasks</mark>. The authors trained their models on NVIDIA GPUs, which allowed them to scale deep networks efficiently—a relatively new practice when this paper was published, underscoring its innovative edge.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Theoretical Insight</strong>: Although the empirical results are impressive, the paper does not delve deeply into the theoretical reasons behind the success of multi-column architectures. It remains unclear how much of the performance gain is due to ensembling versus the intrinsic strength of the individual networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computational Cost</strong>: The approach requires training multiple deep neural networks independently, which could be computationally expensive for larger datasets or higher-dimensional inputs. While GPUs mitigate this to an extent, scaling the multi-column approach to larger tasks would demand significant computational resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limited Applicability to Other Modalities</strong>: The paper focuses solely on image classification. While it hints at the potential for multi-column networks in other domains (e.g., audio or text), the paper doesn’t explore these extensions or provide empirical evidence beyond the image domain.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification, and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="review">Review</h2>
<p>, introduces the dropout technique as an innovative method to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen test data, particularly when dealing with a large number of parameters and limited training samples. The paper addresses this by proposing the use of dropout, a regularization technique that randomly omits units (neurons) during training.</p>
</section>
<section id="core-ideas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-ideas">Core Ideas</h2>
<p>The central concept behind dropout is to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. In a traditional neural network, feature detectors can co-adapt to specific patterns in the training data, which leads to poor generalization. By randomly omitting neurons with a probability of 0.5 during training, each neuron is forced to contribute independently to the final output. This reduces the reliance on specific sets of neurons and ensures that each feature detector learns useful patterns.</p>
<p>Another significant advantage of dropout is that it acts as an efficient form of model averaging. Training with dropout can be seen as training an ensemble of neural networks that share parameters, making it computationally feasible to obtain better generalization without having to train multiple models.</p>
</section>
<section id="experimental-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experimental-results">Experimental Results</h2>
<p>The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of dropout on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, TIMIT, and the Reuters corpus.</p>
<ul>
<li>MNIST: Dropout reduced the error rate from 160 errors to around 110 by applying 50% dropout to hidden units and 20% dropout to input units.</li>
<li>TIMIT: Dropout improved frame classification accuracy in speech recognition tasks, reducing the error rate by 3% in comparison to standard training methods.</li>
<li>CIFAR-10: The authors achieved a 16.6% error rate without dropout and 15.6% with dropout, outperforming previous state-of-the-art results.</li>
<li>ImageNet: Dropout applied to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) reduced the error rate from 48.6% to 42.4%.</li>
<li>Reuters Corpus: Dropout reduced classification error from 31.05% to 29.62%.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="theoretical-contributions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theoretical-contributions">Theoretical Contributions</h2>
<p>The theoretical underpinning of dropout is grounded in model averaging and regularization. In standard practice, model averaging is performed by training multiple models and averaging their predictions, but this approach is computationally expensive. Dropout provides a far more efficient alternative by implicitly training an ensemble of models that share parameters, thus achieving the benefits of model averaging without the overhead of training separate models.</p>
<p>Additionally, dropout mitigates the problem of overfitting by introducing noise during training, making the model more robust. At test time, all units are used, but their outgoing weights are scaled to reflect the fact that fewer units were active during training.</p>
</section>
<section id="discussion-and-impact" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-and-impact">Discussion and Impact</h2>
<p>The introduction of dropout represents a major step forward in the development of deep learning models, as it allows for better generalization across a variety of tasks. Its simplicity, coupled with its effectiveness, has made dropout a standard tool in neural network training. The experiments conducted in the paper demonstrate its utility across a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to speech processing, providing compelling evidence of its broad applicability.</p>
<p>The idea of preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors to improve generalization is an elegant solution to a longstanding problem in neural network training. By ensuring that each neuron must work independently, dropout forces the model to learn more robust features that generalize well to unseen data.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper is a highly influential paper that introduced a novel technique for improving the generalization of deep learning models. The results speak for themselves, with dropout achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and tasks. The technique has since become a standard part of neural network training, revolutionizing the field and contributing to the success of deep learning in real-world applications.</p>

<p>We propose a novel deep network structure called “Network In Network” (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking multiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.</p>

This approach, termed “Network in Network,” replaces the conventional linear filters used in CNNs with small neural networks, allowing for better local feature modeling. The NIN architecture also introduces global average pooling as a substitute for traditional fully connected layers to reduce overfitting and improve the interpretability of the model.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-contributions">Key Contributions</h2>
<p>The NIN paper makes several key contributions to the deep learning landscape:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Mlpconv Layer</strong>: Instead of using traditional linear filters, NIN proposes the use of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) within the convolutional layers (termed mlpconv layers). These layers act as universal function approximators, capable of modeling more complex representations within local receptive fields. This structure allows for better abstraction of non-linear latent concepts, overcoming the limitations of traditional linear filters in CNNs.</p>
<p><img src="https://orenbochman.github.io/reviews/2013/NIN/fig1.png" class="img-fluid"> <img src="https://orenbochman.github.io/reviews/2013/NIN/fig2.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Global Average Pooling</strong>: NIN introduces global average pooling as an alternative to fully connected layers in the final classification stage. This technique computes the spatial average of each feature map, feeding the result directly into a softmax layer for classification. By avoiding fully connected layers, the model becomes less prone to overfitting, thus improving generalization performance. Furthermore, this method provides more interpretable results by establishing a direct correspondence between feature maps and class labels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State-of-the-Art Performance</strong>: The authors demonstrate that NIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, without the need for extensive data augmentation or model ensembling. The architecture consistently outperforms other methods, such as maxout networks and CNNs with dropout regularization, especially in terms of classification accuracy.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Innovative Architecture</strong>: The introduction of MLPs into convolutional layers is a simple yet effective modification that significantly enhances the representational power of the model. This makes NIN a powerful alternative to traditional CNNs, especially for tasks that require fine-grained feature extraction and abstraction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced Overfitting</strong>: The use of global average pooling not only replaces the computationally expensive fully connected layers but also serves as a built-in regularizer, reducing the need for additional techniques like dropout. This structural regularization helps to prevent overfitting, particularly on datasets with limited training examples, such as CIFAR-100.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better Interpretability</strong>: The global average pooling layer allows for easier interpretation of the learned feature maps, as each map is directly associated with a class. This increases the transparency of the network’s the decision-making process compared to conventional CNNs.</p></li>

<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Limited Novelty in Pooling</strong>: While global average pooling is effective, the concept is not entirely new, and its novelty is limited. Previous works have proposed similar techniques for specific tasks. However NIN certainly demonstrates the concepts efficacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: The paper focuses primarily on relatively small datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and MNIST. While NIN excels in these scenarios, it would be interesting to see how the architecture performs on larger, more complex datasets such as ImageNet, where the size and variety of the data might pose additional challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Depth Exploration</strong>: While the architecture consists of three stacked mlpconv layers, the paper does not deeply explore the impact of adding more layers or experimenting with deeper NIN networks. Such exploration could provide insight into how well the architecture scales with increased model depth.</p></li>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>NIN architecture is an elegant and effective solution to improving feature abstraction and reducing overfitting in CNNs. By embedding MLPs within convolutional layers and using global average pooling for classification, NIN achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks.

  <title>Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting</title>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="JMLR:v15:srivastava14a">(Srivastava et al. 2014)</span> the authors, present a novel regularization technique for deep neural networks called “dropout.” The key idea behind dropout is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much and significantly reduces overfitting. The authors show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification, and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p>The technique had been in use in some earlier works, but this paper popularized it and showed its effectiveness on a wide range of tasks. The idea behind drop out is pretty simple and people have since come up with many variations of it. It has become a standard technique in the deep learning toolbox.</p>

<p>Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different thinned networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.</p>

<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="JMLR:v15:srivastava14a">(Srivastava et al. 2014)</span> the authors presents a regularization technique called Dropout, aimed at addressing the critical problem of overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). Dropout randomly drops units (neurons) during training to prevent co-adaptation of units, which can lead to overfitting. This novel technique is demonstrated to significantly improve the performance of neural networks across a wide range of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.</p>

</div></div><p>Dropout works by randomly removing units from the network during each training iteration. This prevents the network from becoming overly reliant on specific units, thus reducing overfitting. During testing, all units are used, but their weights are scaled to account for the dropout during training. This approximates the averaging of an exponential number of thinned networks that would otherwise be computationally infeasible.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology-and-theoretical-motivation">Methodology and Theoretical Motivation</h2>
<p>Dropout’s theoretical foundation stems from biological principles, specifically the idea of genetic robustness in sexual reproduction. In the analogy, a network’s hidden units act like genes that must learn to function independently of one another, preventing complex co-adaptations that may not generalize well to unseen data. The stochastic nature of dropout introduces noise during training, which acts as a form of model averaging and regularization.</p>

<p>While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.</p>

<p>Acquiring the desired font for various design tasks can be challenging and requires professional typographic knowledge. While previous font retrieval or generation works have alleviated some of these difficulties, they often lack support for multiple languages and semantic attributes beyond the training data domains. To solve this problem, we present FontCLIP: a model that connects the semantic understanding of a large vision-language model with typographical knowledge. We integrate typography-specific knowledge into the comprehensive vision-language knowledge of a pretrained CLIP model through a novel finetuning approach. We propose to use a compound descriptive prompt that encapsulates adaptively sampled attributes from a font attribute dataset focusing on Roman alphabet characters. FontCLIP’s semantic typographic latent space demonstrates two unprecedented generalization abilities. First, FontCLIP generalizes to different languages including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), capturing the typographical features of fonts across different languages, even though it was only finetuned using fonts of Roman characters. Second, FontCLIP can recognize the semantic attributes that are not presented in the training data. FontCLIP’s dual-modality and generalization abilities enable multilingual and cross-lingual font retrieval and letter shape optimization, reducing the burden of obtaining desired fonts.</p>

<p>Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models on most of today’s NLP tasks and benchmarks. Yet, the community is only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 4 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 8B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data (as of May 24, 2024). Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.</p>

<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="hatamizadeh2024mambavision">(Hatamizadeh and Kautz 2024)</span>, the authors apply the State Space Model (SSM) inherent in recently introduced Mamba architecture, <span class="citation" data-cites="gu2023mamba">(Gu and Dao 2023)</span>, for vision tasks. They point out that prior work on using the Mamba architecture for vision was ill-suited these tasks and propose a remedy in the form of a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture which they call MambaVision. Thier experiment show that MambaVision outperforms other vision architectures on ImageNet-1K, MS COCO and ADE20K datasets.</p>

<p>Vision Mamba (Vim) and others have proposed modifications such as bidirectional SSMs to address lack of global context and spatial understanding. While bidirectional SSMs have the potential to capture more comprehensive context, they introduce significant latency due to the need to process the entire sequence before making predictions. Additionally, the increased complexity can lead to challenges in training, risk of overfitting, and may not always result in better accuracy. Due to these pitfalls, backbones with Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures still outperform best Mamba-based vision models on different vision tasks. — <span class="citation" data-cites="hatamizadeh2024mambavision">(Hatamizadeh and Kautz 2024, 2)</span></p>

<p>To sum all this up - Mamba’s auto regressive nature is well suited to temporal and sequential data like text and speech but is ill suited to handle spatial data like images where order manifests as a hierarchy of spatial neighborhoods which should be processed in parallel. Thus for vision, mamba suffer a loss in the efficiency of the flow of information both locally and globally. As such pre mamba vision models fare better.</p>

<p>The announcement of the GPT-5 strawberry model has sparked a lot of interest in this paper which seems to be the theory behind Open.ai’s new model.</p>
<section id="tldr" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2024qimprovingmultistepreasoning">(Wang et al. 2024)</span>, titled “Q*: Improving Multi-step Reasoning for LLMs with Deliberative Planning,” the authors propose a new framework called Q* to improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors identify a key issue with LLMs: their auto-regressive nature often leads to errors, hallucinations, and inconsistencies in multi-step reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>some questions to consider:</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in many natural language tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process makes LLMs prone to produce errors, hallucinations and inconsistent statements when performing multi-step reasoning. In this paper, by casting multi-step reasoning of LLMs as a heuristic search problem, we aim to alleviate the pathology by introducing Q*, a general, versatile and agile framework for guiding LLMs decoding process with deliberative planning. By learning a plug-and-play Q-value model as heuristic function for estimating expected future rewards, our Q* can effectively guide LLMs to select the most promising next reasoning step without fine-tuning LLMs for the current task, which avoids the significant computational overhead and potential risk of performance degeneration on other tasks. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MATH and MBPP demonstrate the superiority of our method, contributing to improving the reasoning performance of existing open-source LLMs.</p>

<p>LLMs face challenges in multi-step reasoning tasks, frequently producing errors due to their auto-regressive generation process.

  <title>TheoremLlama An End-To-End Framework to Train a General-Purpose Large Language Model to Become a Lean4 Expert</title>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning. One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation. However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data. This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address the challenges, this paper proposes TheoremLlama, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert. This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. Using the dataset generation method, we provide <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/RickyDeSkywalker/OpenBootstrappedTheorem">Open Bootstrapped Theorems</a> (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning. The TheoremLlama framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%. We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset1, and will soon make all the code publicly available2.</p>

GPT-4 isn’t expected to do well on lean…. </p></div></div><p>TheoremLlama is a significant step towards using LLMs’ natural language abilities to formalize theorem proving in Lean4, improving mathematical reasoning, and tackling major issues with data alignment and training approaches.</p>
<p>However, <mark>the lack of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data frequently makes it difficult for contemporary LLMs to operate efficiently.</mark> The lack of available resources impedes the advancement of efficient training approaches and strategies to fully utilize LLMs’ potential in creating formal mathematical proofs. In order to overcome these limitations, a team of researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Illinois Urban-Champagin has introduced TheoremLlama, an end-to-end framework created to specialize a general-purpose LLM in Lean4 theorem proving.</p>
<p>TheoremLlama is made up of various important parts, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NL-FL Aligned Dataset Generation: TheoremLlama presents techniques for creating an NL-FL-aligned dataset in order to get over data shortage. This dataset, called Open Bootstrapped Theorems (OBT), uses a bootstrapping technique to include NL proofs into Lean4 code. By integrating NL reasoning into Lean4 scenarios, the framework improves LLMs’ comprehension and execution of formal reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>Formal Training for LLM Theorem Provers: The system applies new training strategies to help LLMs become successful Lean4 theorem provers. Methods like block training and curriculum data sorting have been utilized to enhance the LLM’s in-context learning and guarantee reliable training on the OBT dataset. LLM Lean4 Proof Writing: This part is about improving the LLM’s capacity to write formal proofs in Lean4 on its own. The LLM refines its formal reasoning abilities iteratively by using correctly generated proofs as examples.</p></li>
<li><p>TheoremLlama’s NL-FL bootstrapping approach is a significant invention that enables efficient training by coordinating natural language reasoning with formal mathematical language constraints. The framework’s efficiency has been demonstrated by experimental findings, which on the MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets, respectively, yielded cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61%. These outcomes outperformed GPT-4’s baseline findings, which on the same datasets yielded accuracies of 22.95% and 25.41%.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, TheoremLlama is an important step towards using LLMs’ natural language abilities to formalize theorem proving in Lean4, improving mathematical reasoning, and tackling major issues with data alignment and training approaches</p>

<p><mark>Self-attention is the core mathematical operation of modern transformer architectures and is also a significant computational bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity in the sequence length</mark>. In this work, we derive the scalar energy function whose gradient computes the self-attention block, thus elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of self-attention, providing a Bayesian interpretation of the operation and linking it closely with energy-based models such as Hopfield Networks. Our formulation reveals that the reduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel through a tree reduction.

</div></div><p>As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) grow in size and complexity, they often exceed the memory capacity of a single accelerator, necessitating the sharding of model parameters across multiple accelerators. Pipeline parallelism is a commonly used sharding strategy for training large DNNs. However, current implementations of pipeline parallelism are being unintentionally bottlenecked by the automatic differentiation tools provided by ML frameworks. This paper introduces 2-stage backpropagation (2BP). By splitting the backward propagation step into two separate stages, we can reduce idle compute time. We tested 2BP on various model architectures and pipelining schedules, achieving increases in throughput in all cases. Using 2BP, we were able to achieve a 1.70x increase in throughput compared to traditional methods when training a LLaMa-like transformer with 7 billion parameters across 4 GPUs.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ground-breaking-v.s.-record-breaking">Ground Breaking v.s. Record Breaking</h2>
<p>While all papers should have break new ground, I follow <span class="citation" data-cites="Kuhn1962">(Kuhn 1962)</span> in differentiating between what in … considered a jump and a gradual improvement. Most papers that announce a new SOTA results are gradual improvements - essentially tweaks to well understood experiments while the truly ground-breaking papers are rare. Often, we see the authors taking an innovation from another field (perhaps a theoretical result) and applying it to a new domain. Less frequently, the author connects several previously unrelated results or techniques and does something considered impossible. Finally, there are papers where the authors ignore prior art and develop several original ideas, creating a new field. (Like Nash did with non-cooperative game theory)</p>

However, research from information science indicates that it can take a few years for results to circulate, become cited, and adopted. This paper often seems irrelevant later on when there is new research that can get more powerful results. Record-breaking papers (most common) beat the SOTAs by a few fractions of a point and typically arrive in black-box models, and their ‘black magic’ is neither fully understood nor transferable and hard to apply. So, going back to the paper that broke the ground, I find it interesting.</p>

<p>The way top-tier researchers like Christopher Manning, Geoffrey Hinton, Christopher Bishop and David MacKay came up with their breakthroughs is frequently motivated and outlined in their papers. These can be as simple as making a PCA that works on Neural Networks for TSNE <sup>1</sup>. In <span class="citation" data-cites="pennington-etal-2014-glove">(Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014)</span> such as getting embedding to work using a covariance matrix rather than a moving window. Or as complicated as introducing causal regret for credit assignment for agents solving social dilemmas. In many ways, the intellectual journey is more fascinating than any specific magic trick.</p>

</div></div><p>Reviewing paper it not as good as taking a class with them. If you can do that. However, but teaching is often not the forte for most gifted researchers - sometimes their finest hours are when writing papers. Another point is that in the class teachers are very much limited by the material they can present - the students can only cover so much new mathematics in a class. In a paper they are writing to their peers so that all bets are off and the material can be as advanced as needed and touch on many disparate fields. In Skrym’s book on the evolution of signaling systems routinely touch on game theory, evolution, information theory, sociology, and classical philosophy. The reader left to catch up on their own if they can and to dive into the literature if they are dissatisfied with some of the the author’s claim. but most courses are not as advanced as most papers. I took courses by Christopher Manning or Geoffrey Hinton. However And yet, most of their publications are just as useful to review. It is not enough to read them if you want to assimilate some of their creativity or problem solving approaches. away in the sense that they provide a unique insight into the workings of their minds. It’s fascinating and inspiring to see how these influential figures think about problems and how they approach them. Their papers offer a valuable perspective that can’t be found elsewhere, and this understanding can be a great source of motivation for your own research. What I like about these two authors is that they can take some old ideas/techniques and figure out how to use them in new settings. T-SNE came from PCA, and GLOVE came from Topic Modelling.</p>
<p>I won’t say that ground-breaking papers are easy to read—yet some are written with great clarity, and others, like the LSTM papers, are notoriously difficult to understand. But you may discover that reading through the paper beats watching videos or blog posts by others.</p>
<p>Some points to consider when reviewing the paper.</p>

<p>To build agents that can collaborate effectively with others, recent research has trained artificial agents to communicate with each other in Lewis-style referential games. However, this often leads to successful but uninterpretable communication. We argue that this is due to the game objective: communicating about a single object in a shared visual context is prone to overfitting and does not encourage language useful beyond concrete reference. In contrast, human language conveys a rich variety of abstract ideas. To promote such skills, we propose games that require communicating generalizations over sets of objects representing abstract visual concepts, optionally with separate contexts for each agent. We find that these games greatly improve systematicity and interpretability of the learned languages, according to several metrics in the literature. Finally, we propose a method for identifying logical operations embedded in the emergent languages by learning an approximate compositional reconstruction of the language.</p>

<p>Abstract Transfer of information between senders and receivers, of one kind or another, is essential to all life. David Lewis introduced a game theoretic model of the simplest case, where one sender and one receiver have pure common interest. How hard or easy is it for evolution to achieve information transfer in Lewis signaling?. The answers involve surprising subtleties. We discuss some if these in terms of evolutionary dynamics in both finite and infinite populations, with and without mutation.</p>

<p>Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI). Recent CLWE methods use linear projections, which underfit the training dictionary, to generalize on BLI. However, underfitting can hinder generalization to other downstream tasks that rely on words from the training dictionary. We address this limitation by retrofitting CLWE to the training dictionary, which pulls training translation pairs closer in the embedding space and overfits the training dictionary. This simple post-processing step often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test accuracy.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-points">Key Points:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Traditional Evaluation of CLWE</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) typically aim to map words from different languages into a shared vector space.</li>
<li>They are commonly evaluated using Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI), which tests the model’s ability to translate words based on a set of test words.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Underfitting in Projection-Based CLWE</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Current CLWE methods, particularly linear projection-based ones, underfit the training dictionary. This means they don’t perfectly align all translation pairs in the training data.</li>
<li>The paper argues that this underfitting, while beneficial for BLI test accuracy, can hinder performance on downstream tasks where words from the training dictionary play a critical role.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Retrofitting Approach</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The authors propose retrofitting as a post-processing step to bring training translation pairs closer in the embedding space, essentially overfitting the training dictionary.</li>
<li>This retrofitting involves modifying the embeddings to minimize distances between training translation pairs while retaining as much of the original structure as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Retrofitting to Synthetic Dictionaries:
<ul>
<li>In addition to the training dictionary, the paper introduces retrofitting to a synthetic dictionary induced from the original CLWE using the Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling (CSLS) heuristic.</li>
<li>This helps balance the need to fit the training dictionary while maintaining some generalization capability for unseen words.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="experimental-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experimental-results">Experimental Results:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>BLI Accuracy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Retrofitting the embeddings to the training dictionary results in perfect alignment of training pairs, leading to decreased BLI test accuracy since the embeddings overfit the training data.</li>
<li>However, retrofitting to a synthetic dictionary can achieve a balance, improving BLI test accuracy somewhat while still fitting the training data better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Downstream Tasks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The authors evaluates the retrofitted embeddings on two downstream tasks: <strong>document classification</strong> and <strong>dependency parsing</strong>.</li>
<li>Despite lower BLI test accuracy, retrofitted embeddings often lead to improved performance on these tasks. This underscores the importance of fully exploiting the training dictionary for downstream performance.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-contributions">Main Contributions:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Challenge to BLI as a Sole Metric</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The authors argues that BLI accuracy does not always correlate with downstream task performance, revealing the limitations of relying solely on BLI for evaluating CLWE.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Retrofitting as a Beneficial Overfitting</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It shows that overfitting to the training dictionary through retrofitting can be beneficial, enhancing the performance of downstream tasks even if it harms BLI test accuracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Synthetic Dictionary for Balance:
<ul>
<li>Introducing the use of a synthetic dictionary for retrofitting provides a middle ground, balancing the need to fit the training dictionary while retaining some generalization ability.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion:</h2>
<p>The authors suggest that the overemphasis on BLI as an evaluation metric for CLWE should be reconsidered, advocating instead for a focus on downstream tasks that better reflect the utility of the embeddings. They propose that future work might explore more complex non-linear projections to better fit the dictionary without compromising on generalization.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The paper’s main takeaway is that overfitting to the training dictionary via retrofitting is not inherently harmful. In fact, it can lead to better performance on downstream NLP tasks. This insight invites a reconsideration of the evaluation metrics for cross-lingual word embeddings and opens the door for future work on more sophisticated retrofitting and projection methods.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not surprising that the authors ‘discovered’ that fitting the model on <code>test</code> + <code>train</code> + <code>validation</code> gives better results then fitting on <code>train</code> part only. After all the best way to reduce overfitting is to give it more data.</li>
<li>This is a common practice in machine learning to train on the full dataset once we have used to get the best results when the model is deployed to production.</li>
<li>Bayesian LOO Cross validation also allows one to measure the generalization error of the model without having to make the sacrifice of a train/test split.</li>
<li>Considering that the dataset is a dictionary means there is probably little noise to overfit on.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand their criticism of BLI as a metric is valid. There are lots of bad metrics and it is more so when we wish to use it to estimate performance on a different task. In RL one uses importance sampling to make the correction between on policy and off policy - perhaps this is something to look into, though it would be easier to do this if this was a RL problem rather than supervised ML.</p>
<p>It is a common practice in machine learning to use a proxy metric to evaluate the model. The problem is that the proxy metric is not always a good indicator of the model’s performance on the real task. This is why it is important to evaluate the model on the real task as well.</p>
