This paper uses lots of big terms so let's break them down so we can understand them better

Binary Choice
: A decision context offering exactly two mutually exclusive options.

Externality
: An effect of a decision or action on a third party who did not have a choice in the matter.

Internality
: The direct effect of an individual's choice on their own well-being or payoff.

Payoff
: The benefit, reward, or consequence associated with a particular choice in a given situation.

Dominant Strategy
: A course of action that yields the best outcome for a decision-maker regardless of what other participants in the situation choose.

Dominated Strategy
: A course of action that yields a worse outcome for a decision-maker compared to another strategy, no matter what other participants choose.

Equilibrium
: A stable state in a system where opposing forces are balanced, and there is no inherent tendency for change. In game theory, it often refers to a situation where each actor is making the best choice given the choices of others.

Inefficient Equilibrium
: An equilibrium outcome where all individuals are acting rationally in their own self-interest, but the resulting overall outcome is worse for everyone compared to a different possible outcome.

Collective Maximum
: The configuration of choices across all individuals that results in the highest possible total or average payoff for the group as a whole.

Coalition
: A group of individuals who cooperate or coordinate their actions to achieve a shared goal.

Viable Coalition
: A coalition of sufficient size that its members benefit from cooperating on a particular choice, even if others do not join.

Free Rider
: An individual who benefits from the actions or resources of others without contributing themselves.

MPD (Multiperson Prisoner's Dilemma)
: An extension of the Prisoner's Dilemma to a group larger than two, characterized by a dominant strategy for each individual that leads to a collectively suboptimal outcome.

MIRV (Marginal Individual Right Value)
: A curve representing the value of choosing the "Right" option for individuals with differing internal preferences for "Left," as the number choosing "Right" increases. Used in analyzing situations with identical externalities but different internalities.

IRC (Induced Right Choice)
: A curve showing, for any proportion of the population choosing "Right," the proportion of the population for whom a "Right" choice would be preferred. Used in analyzing situations with identical internalities but different externalities.

Compatibility
: A situation where uniform choices among individuals lead to better outcomes for everyone compared to mixed choices.

Complementarity
: A situation where a mix of different choices among individuals leads to a better overall outcome compared to everyone making the same choice.

Dual Equilibria
: A situation where there are two stable equilibrium points, often at opposing extremes of the possible choices.
