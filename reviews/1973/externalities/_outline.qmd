- Introduction
  - Describes the phenomenon of individuals making binary choices that are affected by the choices of others.
  - Mentions examples such as wearing hockey helmets, carrying concealed weapons, and adhering to daylight saving time.
  - Discusses the complexities arising from varying externality configurations in large populations.
  - Highlights the simplified scenario of identical payoffs and influences for all individuals.
  - Introduces the concept of a "receiving" and "transmitting strength" for individuals in a system of externalities.
  - Explains the influence of spatial arrangement on individual choices.
- Knowledge and Observation
  - Discusses the impact of knowledge and observation on binary choices with externalities.
  - Presents examples illustrating the varying visibility of choices and their consequences.
  - Notes the importance of monitoring individual choices or aggregates for discipline and enforcement.
- Prisoner's Dilemma
  - Introduces the classic prisoner's dilemma scenario and its characteristics.
  - Extends the definition of prisoner's dilemma to multi-person scenarios (MPD).
  - Defines the key parameters of MPD, including the minimum viable coalition size (k) and the influence of externalities.
  - Presents graphical representations (Figure 2) of different MPD scenarios.
  - Explains the concept of collective maximum and its relation to individual choices.
  - Connects the graphical representations to real-world examples like rationing schemes.
- The Significant Parameters
  - Discusses the significance of parameters like k, k/n, and nk in varying situations.
  - Highlights the impact of population size (n) on externalities and coalition viability.
  - Explains the concept of increasing and diminishing differentials between dominant and dominated choices.
  - Explores the possibility of collective maximum occurring with a mix of choices.
- Coalitions
  - Defines coalitions as groups making collective decisions in binary choice scenarios.
  - Discusses the existence of multiple coalitions with varying levels of formality.
  - Explains the strategic dynamics between two coalitions in a simplified game (Figure 4).
  - Introduces the concept of reaction curves and their impact on collective outcomes (Figure 5).
- Some Different Configurations
  - Explores scenarios where choice curves intersect, with implications for equilibria and collective maxima (Figures 6-9).
  - Discusses the case of "the commons" as an example of contingent externalities (Figure 10).
  - Analyzes situations with dual equilibria and their organizational challenges (Figure 11).
  - Presents MPD as a truncated dual equilibrium case (Figure 12).
- Curvatures
  - Briefly examines scenarios with non-linear choice curves, including U-shaped curves for compatibility and inverted U-shaped curves for complementarity (Figures 13-14).
  - Discusses the case of "sufficiency" with two intersections and its practical interpretations (Figure 15).
- Graduated Preferences
  - Relaxes the assumption of identical payoffs and explores scenarios with graduated preferences.
  - Analyzes cases with identical externalities and differing internalities (Figure 16).
  - Discusses scenarios with identical internalities and differing externalities (Figure 17).
  - Introduces the MIRV (Marginal Individual Right Value) curve and its significance.
  - Presents the IRC (Induced Right Choice) curve as a cumulative distribution of crossover points (Figure 18).
- More Than Two Choices
  - Briefly discusses the generalizability of the binary choice analysis to scenarios with three or more choices.
  - Highlights the differences in applying the analysis to symmetrical and asymmetrical cases.
  - Presents an example of a trinary choice with varying externality configurations (Figure 19).
- A Schematic Summary
  - Presents a schematic overview of different binary-choice payoff configurations using straight lines (Figure 20).
  - Classifies the scenarios based on equilibrium characteristics, universal preference, and collective maxima.
- Equilibria, Universal Preference, Uniformity, and Collective Maxima
  - Provides a concise classification scheme for binary choice situations with straight-line payoff curves.
  - Differentiates scenarios based on equilibrium characteristics, collective maximum positions, and preference structures.
  - Emphasizes the need to consider order, timing, reversibility of choices, information, and other factors not captured by the payoff curves alone.
