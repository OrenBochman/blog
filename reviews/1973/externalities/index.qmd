<!-- LEDE personal context why I reviewed this source -->

In @schelling1973hockey, Schelling explores the phenomenon of individuals making binary choices that are influenced by the choices of others. He uses examples such as wearing hockey helmets, carrying concealed weapons, and adhering to daylight saving time to illustrate the complexities that arise from varying externality configurations in large populations. The paper delves into the dynamics of these choices, highlighting the significance of spatial arrangement and the influence of knowledge and observation on individual decisions.

I like Schelling's writing because his approach is to tackle interesting issues at a level where  very simple analysis tools can be brought to bear and then he brings out reams of conclusions and implications of the analysis. I don't mean to suggest that it is trivial, not easy, but that he is able to take a very simple model that then turns out to be very general.

One of my personal issues is complexity, and I think that reading classics like this imparts the power of simple models.

## TL;DR - Too Long; Didn't Read about Externalities

![Externalities in a nutshell](/images/in_the_nut_shell_coach_retouched.jpg)

**Thomas Schelling's 1973 article explores binary choices where one person's decision affects others, known as externalities.** Using examples like hockey helmets and daylight saving, the paper examines situations where individual self-interest may not lead to the best collective outcome. **Schelling analyzes various configurations of these choices, including the Prisoner's Dilemma and scenarios with multiple equilibria.** He discusses how factors like knowledge, observation, and the formation of coalitions influence these decisions. **The analysis extends to consider cases with more than two choices and situations where individuals have different payoffs.** Ultimately, the article provides a framework for understanding the complexities of interdependent decision-making and the challenges of achieving efficient social outcomes when externalities are present.

    title='Milton Friedman - Helmet and Seat Belt Laws?' >}}

Dr. Milton Friedman explains how seat belt laws and helmet laws for adults only make sense only when citizens are government property.  
 
:::

While [Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling) argues that regulation for helmets in hockey, might be not only necessary but also desirable. 

[Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) says that according to Stewart Mills regulation should only be used when an individual's actions cause harm to others. And thus that when helmet use is regulated this is a violation of personal freedom, with the implication that the regulation places social costs above individual freedom. He suggests this is a slippery slope where legislators  asserts oversight over other personal choices on the grounds of social costs. 

This results in a tension between when an externality should be regulated and when it should not.
