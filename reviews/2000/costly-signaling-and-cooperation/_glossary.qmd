This book/paper uses lots of big terms so let's break them down so we can understand them better

Costly Signaling
: A theoretical framework suggesting that individuals can reliably signal their underlying quality by engaging in behaviors that are more costly for lower-quality individuals to perform.

Cooperation
: Behavior by two or more individuals that leads to mutual benefit. In the context of the paper, it often refers to providing a benefit to the group.

Public Goods Game
: A type of game in which individuals can contribute to a common pool that benefits everyone, but individual contributions are costly, leading to the incentive to free-ride.

Signaler
: An individual who performs a costly action (the signal) to convey information about their quality.

Partner
: An individual who observes the signal and uses this information to make decisions about forming alliances or other social interactions with the signaler.

Quality
: An underlying attribute of an individual (e.g., health, strength, skill) that is difficult to observe directly but affects their value as a mate, ally, or competitor.

Honest Signal
: A signal that reliably indicates the signaler's true quality because it is too costly for low-quality individuals to fake.

Free-riding
: Benefiting from a public good without contributing to its provision.

Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)
: A strategy that, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any rare alternative strategy.

Nash Equilibrium
: A state in a game where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.

Replicator Dynamic
: A model of evolutionary change where the frequency of a strategy in a population increases if its payoff is higher than the average payoff of the population.

Basin of Attraction
: The set of initial conditions (e.g., frequencies of strategies) that will eventually lead to a particular stable equilibrium under a dynamic process.

Broadcast Efficiency
: The extent to which a signal is observable by a wide audience of potential partners.

Multilevel Selection
: A form of natural selection that operates on multiple levels of organization, such as genes, individuals, and groups.

Dominant Strategy
: A strategy that yields the highest payoff for a player regardless of the strategies chosen by other players.

Payoff Matrix
: A table that shows the payoffs to each player in a game for every possible combination of strategies.
