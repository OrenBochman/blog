<!-- LEDE personal context why I reviewed this source --> 

After I became a data scientist I wanted to squeeze out more insights and to developer better models from the data. I kept going back to my statistic and probability text book.

### A horror story of statistics

![a statistical horror story](coding-horror.png){.float-start width="250px"}

But that text book was all theorems and no ... practical advice. The author had been a friendly professor. He told us that we should buy his book as it would cover the material in the course. I was broke but I scraped together the money to buy the book. About three weeks into the course he became the department head for CS and Mathematics and never taught us again. He assigned a visiting post doc to teaching us. She was smart, sweet and didn't speak a word of English or Hebrew only French and the book was in hebrew. I got by reading the book and most of the class failed the first and second exam and had to retake it. I got a mediocre grade and had to do my military service. Years later I wanted to under stand why such a wonderfully printer book was so hard to read and looked at the single page bibliography. It was a very short list. The first title that seemed relevant was a graduate level text book which stated in the intro "The aim of this book is to present a fundamental proof to the central limit theorems. The material is written so as to get the reader to the proof in the fastest way possible." I looked at the table of contents and realized I had a trimmed translation of this text with a few appendixes for material from other courses. Ok there was some stats, the  central limit theorem, the law of large numbers and definitions of expectation and variance as a plethora of other results scattered here and there.

The real disaster for me is that I desperately needed some statistics for my second and third year courses in Physics.
But the course was a year too late. I eventually taught myself statistics, but I was forever feeling an Imposter in the field - even after tutoring friends and fellow student on the subject. 

When I eventually took another class on statistics some years later. There ware no proofs and the teacher was an emeritus professor charged with calculating academic biblliometrics like h-scores for all the academics in the university. He was shocked every time he came up with a new concept I kept answering his questions without thinking -- while my classmates seemed to be having a hard time. I had developed an uncanny intuition for the subject... But in reality I was just as shocked as he was.

So I keep the highlighting copy of the book around at least until I get my money's worth :-) but I ended up taking courses on line to get to more advanced material.

Eventually I cam across this book which does what I had set out to do. Making an outline of the more practical theoretical results alongside the techniques of statistics, exercises  giving some opportunities to practice them so you can really start using them on a daily basis! And last but not least code examples to use.

## TL;DR - Too Long; Didn't Read about Statistics <!-- Short Catchy title -->

![All of Statistics in a nutshell](/images/in_the_nut_shell_coach_retouched.jpg)

This is a no nonsense introduction to statistics.  
It isn't a complete treatment as the title suggest.
However when it came out it was more up to date then what you might expect to be taught in most statistics courses.

I recommend the chapters on inequalities and causality.

### Part I: Probability

Here is an outline of Chapter 1, "Probability," based on the provided excerpts from "book.pdf," with mathematical expressions surrounded by dollar signs:

*   **1 Probability**
    *   **1.1 Introduction**
        *   Probability is defined as a **mathematical language for quantifying uncertainty**.
        *   This chapter introduces the basic concepts underlying probability theory.
        *   It begins with the **sample space**, which is the set of possible outcomes.
    *   **1.2 Sample Spaces and Events**
        *   The **sample space $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes of an experiment**.
        *   Points $\omega$ in $\Omega$ are called **sample outcomes, realizations, or elements**.
        *   **Subsets of $\Omega$ are called Events**.
        *   **Example 1.1**: Tossing a coin twice gives $\Omega = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$. The event that the first toss is heads is $A = \{HH, HT\}$.
    *   **1.3 Probability**
        *   This section introduces the definition and axioms of probability. 
        *   **Definition 1.5**: A **probability measure** $P$ on a sample space $\Omega$ is a function $P: A \rightarrow [0, 1]$ that satisfies three axioms:
            *   **Axiom 1**: $P(A) \geq 0$ for all events $A$.
            *   **Axiom 2**: $P(\Omega) = 1$.
            *   **Axiom 3**: If $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are disjoint events, then $P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)$.
    *   **1.4 Probability on Finite Sample Spaces**
        *   This section discusses how to calculate probabilities when the sample space contains a finite number of equally likely outcomes.
        * If $\Omega = \{ \omega_1, \ldots, \omega_n \}$, then $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$ for any event $A \subset \Omega$.   
    *   **1.5 Independent Events**
        *   This section defines independent events.
    *   **1.6 Conditional Probability**
        *   This section introduces the concept of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ 
    *   **1.7 Bayes’ Theorem**
        *   **Theorem 1.17 (Bayes’ Theorem)** is presented: Let $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ be a partition of $\Omega$ such that $P(A_i) > 0$ for each $i$. If $P(B) > 0$, then for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$, $P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}$.
        *   **Remark 1.18**: $P(A_i)$ is called the **prior probability** of $A_i$, and $P(A_i|B)$ is called the **posterior probability** of $A_i$.
        *   **Example 1.19**: An email categorization example is provided, calculating the probability that an email containing the word "free" is spam using Bayes' Theorem.
    *   **1.8 Bibliographic Remarks**
        *   Several books are mentioned as further reading: 
          - DeGroot and Schervish (2002), 
          - Grimmett and Stirzaker (1982), 
          - Karr (1993), 
          - Billingsley (1979), and 
          - Breiman (1992).

*   **2 Random Variables**
    *   **2.1 Introduction**
        *   A **random variable** is a mapping that assigns a real number $X(\omega)$ to each outcome $\omega$ in the sample space.
    *   **2.2 Distribution Functions and Probability Functions**
        *   Covers the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)$.
        *   Discusses probability functions $f_X(x) = P(X=x)$ for discrete random variables.
        *   Example 2.6 provides a probability function for flipping a coin twice:
            $f_X(x) = \begin{cases} 1/4 & x = 0 \\ 1/2 & x = 1 \\ 1/4 & x = 2 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$.
        *   Figure 2.2 illustrates this probability function.
    *   **2.3 Some Important Discrete Random Variables**
        * Point Mass Distribution. 
        * The Discrete Uniform Distribution.
        * The Bernoulli Distribution.
        * The Binomial Distribution.
        * The Geometric Distribution.
        * The Poisson Distribution.
        *   The text mentions that for continuous random variables, it's more convenient to define things in terms of the pdf, as the probability of a continuous random variable taking a specific value is zero.
    *   **2.4 Some Important Continuous Random Variables**
        *   This section details important continuous distributions.
        *   **Normal Distribution**: Denoted as $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, with density $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$.
            *   Standard Normal distribution $Z \sim N(0, 1)$ has density $\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}$ and CDF $\Phi(z) = P(Z \leq z)$.
            *   $P(a < X < b) = \Phi(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma}) - \Phi(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma})$ if $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.
            *   Figure 2.4 shows the density of a standard Normal.
            *   Example 2.17: If $X \sim N(3, 5)$, find $P(X > 1)$.
        *   **Uniform Distribution**: $X \sim Uniform(a, b)$ has density $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$ for $a < x < b$, and $0$ otherwise.
            *   Example 2.39 involves a Uniform(0, 1) distribution.
        *   **Exponential Distribution**: $X \sim Exp(\beta)$ has density $f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta} e^{-x/\beta}$ for $x > 0$, $\beta > 0$, and $0$ otherwise.

    *   **2.5 Multivariate Distributions**
        *   This section covers the joint distribution of two or more random variables.
        *   The concept of a joint density $f(x, y)$ for continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ such that $P(a < X < b, c < Y < d) = \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x, y) dy dx$ will likely be introduced.
        *   Marginal distributions can be obtained by integrating (or summing) the joint distribution over the other variables: $f_X(x) = \int f(x, y) dy$ and $f_Y(y) = \int f(x, y) dx$.
        *   Example 2.27 is mentioned in Example 2.38, where the marginal density $f_Y(y) = y + (1/2)$ is used.
        *   Example 2.38 involves finding a conditional probability $P(X < 1/4 | Y = 1/3)$ using the conditional density $f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}$.
    *   **2.6 Independence**
        *   Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if their joint distribution is the product of their marginal distributions: $F_{X,Y}(x, y) = F_X(x) F_Y(y)$ or $f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)$.        
    *   **2.7 Conditional Probability**
        *   Extends the concept of conditional probability from events to random variables, likely defining conditional distributions and densities.
        *   Example 2.38 shows the calculation of conditional probability for continuous random variables.
    *   **2.8 Bayes' Theorem for Random Variables**
        *   Will likely present an extension of Bayes' Theorem to relate conditional densities: $f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f_{Y|X}(y|x) f_X(x)}{f_Y(y)}$.
    *   **2.9 Multivariate Distributions and iid Samples**
        *   Covers the concept of multiple random variables considered together.
        *   Introduces the idea of independent and identically distributed (iid) samples $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ drawn from the same distribution.
    *   **2.10 Two Important Multivariate Distributions**
        *   Discusses specific multivariate distributions.
        *   **Multinomial Distribution**: Mentioned in Chapter 14 and likely introduced here.
        *   **Multivariate Normal Distribution**: Also mentioned in Chapter 14 and likely introduced here.
    *   **2.11 Transformations of Random Variables**
        *   Deals with finding the distribution of a function of one or more random variables (e.g., if $Y = g(X)$, how to find $F_Y$ or $f_Y$).
    *   **2.12 Transformations of Several Random Variables**
        *   Extends the transformation techniques to functions of multiple random variables.



*   **3 Expectation**
    *   **3.1 Expectation of a Random Variable**
        *   Introduces the concept of the expectation of a random variable.
        *   The notation $\int x dF(x)$ is used as a unifying notation for both discrete ($\sum_x xf(x)$) and continuous ($\int xf(x)dx$) random variables.
        *   It is noted that the precise meaning of $\int x dF(x)$ is discussed in real analysis courses.
        *   The expectation $E(X)$ is said to exist if $\int |x|dF_X(x) < \infty$. Otherwise, the expectation does not exist.
    *   **3.2 Properties of Expectations**
        *   This section will likely cover properties such as linearity of expectation, $E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)$, and other fundamental rules.
    *   **3.3 Variance and Covariance**

    *   **5.2 Types of Convergence**
        *   This section will detail different modes of convergence for random variables. These typically include:
            *   Convergence in probability: $P(|X_n - X| > \epsilon) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ for all $\epsilon > 0$.
            *   Almost sure convergence (or convergence with probability 1): $P(\lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = X) = 1$.
            *   Convergence in $r$-th mean: $E(|X_n - X|^r) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ for some $r > 0$ (commonly $r=1$ for convergence in mean and $r=2$ for convergence in mean square).
            *   Convergence in distribution (or weak convergence): $F_{X_n}(x) \to F_X(x)$ as $n \to \infty$ for all $x$ at which $F_X$ is continuous, where $F_{X_n}$ and $F_X$ are the cumulative distribution functions of $X_n$ and $X$, respectively.
    *   **5.3 The Law of Large Numbers**
        *   This section will likely cover fundamental theorems related to the convergence of sample averages to the population mean. This usually includes:
            *   The Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN): For a sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ with mean $\mu$, the sample mean $\bar{X}_n = (1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ converges in probability to $\mu$.
            *   The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN): Under similar conditions, the sample mean $\bar{X}_n$ converges almost surely to $\mu$.
    *   **5.4 The Central Limit Theorem**
        *   This crucial theorem describes the limiting distribution of the standardized sample mean. It typically states that for a sequence of iid random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2 > 0$, the standardized sample mean $\frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$ converges in distribution to a standard Normal distribution $N(0, 1)$.
    *   **5.5 The Delta Method**
        *   The delta method is a technique for approximating the distribution of a function of a random variable when the limiting distribution of the random variable is known (usually Normal). If $\sqrt{n}(X_n - \theta) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, \sigma^2)$ and $g$ is a differentiable function, then $\sqrt{n}(g(X_n) - g(\theta)) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, (g'(\theta))^2 \sigma^2)$. This is also mentioned in the context of parametric inference in Chapter 9.

    *   **6.2 Parametric and Nonparametric Models**
        *   Introduces the concept of a **statistical model** as a set of probability distributions that we assume our data comes from.
        *   Defines a **parametric model** as a model that is indexed by a finite-dimensional parameter $\theta$ belonging to a parameter space $\Theta$. It is written as $F = \{f(x; \theta) : \theta \in \Theta\}$.
        *   Defines a **nonparametric model** as a model that is not indexed by a finite-dimensional parameter. The set of all continuous distribution functions is an example.

        *   Explains that in parametric inference, the goal is to estimate $\theta$.
        *   In nonparametric inference, the goal might be to estimate an unknown distribution function $F$ or a regression function $r(x) = E(Y|X=x)$ without assuming a specific parametric form.
        *   Mentions **frequentist** and **Bayesian** approaches to statistical inference, noting that both will be covered, starting with frequentist inference.
        *   Introduces the notation $P_\theta(X \in A) = ∫_A f(x; \theta)dx$ and $E_\theta(r(X)) = ∫ r(x)f(x; \theta)dx$ for parametric models, emphasizing that $\theta$ is fixed, not averaged over. $V_\theta$ is used for variance.

        *   **6.3.2 Confidence Sets**
            *   Explains that a **confidence set** $C_n$ is a random set constructed from data such that it contains the true value of the parameter with a specified probability.
            *   For a parameter $\theta$, a $1 - \alpha$ confidence set satisfies $P_\theta(\theta \in C_n) \ge 1 - \alpha$ for all $\theta \in \Theta$, where $1 - \alpha$ is the **coverage probability**.
            *   Discusses **pointwise asymptotic confidence intervals**, where $lim inf_{n \to \infty} P_\theta(\theta \in C_n) \ge 1 - \alpha$ for all $\theta \in \Theta$.
            *   Also mentions **uniform asymptotic confidence intervals**, where $lim inf_{n \to \infty} inf_{\theta \in \Theta} P_\theta(\theta \in C_n) \ge 1 - \alpha$.
        *   **6.3.3 Hypothesis Testing**
            *   Describes **hypothesis testing** as a procedure for deciding between two competing claims about a population, the **null hypothesis** ($H_0$) and the **alternative hypothesis** ($H_1$).
            *   Provides an example of testing the fairness of a coin: $H_0 : p = 1/2$ versus $H_1 : p \ne 1/2$, where $p$ is the probability of heads.
            *   Suggests using a **test statistic**, such as $T = |\hat{p}_n - (1/2)|$, to make a decision, where $\hat{p}_n$ is the sample proportion of heads. The null hypothesis would be rejected if $T$ is large.
    *   **6.4 Bibliographic Remarks**
        *   Lists several textbooks on statistical inference at elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels.
    *   **6.5 Appendix**

        *   **Example (The Mean)** illustrates the plug-in estimate for the mean $\mu = E_F(X) = ∫ x dF(x)$, which is the sample mean $\bar{X}_n = ∫ x dF̂_n(x) = (1/n) ∑_{i=1}^n X_i$.
        *   **Example (The Variance)** shows the plug-in estimate for the variance $\sigma^2 = E_F(X − \mu)^2$, which is the sample variance $S_n^2 = (1/n) ∑_{i=1}^n (X_i − \bar{X}_n)^2$.
        *   **Example (The Median)** defines the median $m$ as $F(m) = 1/2$ and the plug-in estimate as the sample median $F̂_n^{-1}(1/2)$.
        *   **Example (Trimmed Mean)** defines the $\alpha$-trimmed mean and its plug-in estimate.
        *   The $p$th sample quantile is defined as $T(F̂_n) = F̂_n^{-1}(p)$.

        *   Mentions that formulas will be developed for parametric methods, but nonparametric settings require something else.
        *   The next chapter will introduce the bootstrap for getting standard errors and confidence intervals.

            *   The justification involves a monotone transformation $U = m(T)$ such that $U \sim N(\phi, c^2)$ where $\phi = m(\theta)$.
            *   It discusses the relationship between the sample quantiles of the bootstrap replicates $U^{*b}$ and the quantiles of the Normal distribution.
            *   It shows that $P(\theta^*_{\alpha/2} \le \theta \le \theta^*_{1-\alpha/2}) = 1 - \alpha$ under the assumption of an exact normalizing transformation.

        *   Predicted values or fitted values are $\hat{Y}_i = \hat{r}(X_i)$.
        *   Residuals are defined as the difference between the observed and predicted values.
        *   Example 13.5 shows the least squares estimates for the star data.
        *   The variance of a prediction $\hat{Y}^*$ at a new point $x^*$ is given by $\xi^2_n = V(\hat{Y}^*) + \sigma^2$.
    *   **13.5 Multiple Regression**
        *   Extends the linear regression model to include multiple covariates.
        *   Example 13.6 illustrates multiple regression with the 2001 Presidential Election data in Florida, predicting Buchanan's votes based on Bush's votes.
        *   The output of a multiple regression program typically includes coefficient estimates, standard errors, t-values (Wald test statistics), and p-values.
    *   **13.6 Model Selection**
        *   Addresses the problem of choosing which covariates to include in a multiple regression model.
        *   Smaller models are more parsimonious and might give better predictions than larger models.
        *   Adding more variables decreases bias but increases variance, leading to a bias-variance tradeoff.
        *   Underfitting (too few covariates) leads to high bias, while overfitting (too many covariates) leads to high variance.
        *   Example 13.14 (not explicitly shown in the excerpts but mentioned) illustrates the problem of having many covariates.
        *   AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is introduced as an approximately unbiased estimate of a measure of prediction accuracy.
        *   Theorem 13.18 states that $AIC(M_j)$ is an approximately unbiased estimate of $a(f, \hat{f})$ (a measure of distance between the true density $f$ and the estimated density $\hat{f}$ for model $M_j$).
    *   **13.7 Logistic Regression**
        *   Introduces logistic regression for predicting a binary outcome variable.
        *   The model is $r(x) = P(Y = 1|X = x) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j}}$.
        *   The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) $\hat{\beta}$ is obtained numerically.
        *   Example 13.17 (referenced in Example 22.11) likely provides an example of logistic regression.
    *   **13.8 Bibliographic Remarks**
        *   Provides references for further reading on linear and logistic regression.

        *   Discusses notation involving vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$ and matrices $A$.
    *   **14.2 Estimating the Correlation**
        *   Covers methods for **estimating the correlation** between multiple variables.        
        *   Errata mentions a correction for equation (14.6), where the numerator should be divided by $n-1$, likely related to the sample covariance or correlation.
    *   **14.3 Multivariate Normal**
        *   Discusses the **Multivariate Normal distribution**.
        *   The index mentions "positive definite" and a matrix $\Sigma$ on p.231, which is a key property of the covariance matrix in a Multivariate Normal distribution.
        *   Example 12.9 shows the Bayes estimator for the mean of a Normal distribution with a Normal prior.
    *   **14.4 Multinomial**
        *   Covers the **Multinomial distribution**.
        *   Errata corrects a phrase in Section 14.4, changing "3. 'balls of the kth color'" to "3. 'balls of the jth color'," indicating a discussion of categories within the Multinomial distribution.
        *   The index mentions Pearson's $\chi^2$ test on p. 241, which is commonly used for analyzing Multinomial data.

*   **15 Contingency Tables**
    *   Introduces the analysis of **multivariate discrete data**.
    *   The data can be represented as **counts in a $r_1 \times r_2 \times \cdots \times r_m$ table**.
    *   **15.1 Definition. The odds ratio** is defined to be $\psi = \frac{p_{00}p_{11}}{p_{01}p_{10}}$ (Equation 15.1).
    *   **The log odds ratio** is defined to be $\gamma = \log(\psi)$ (Equation 15.2).
    *   **15.2 Theorem. The following statements are equivalent:**
        *   1. $Y \perp Z$
        *   2. $\psi = 1$
        *   3. $\gamma = 0$
        *   4. For $i, j \in \{0, 1\}$, $p_{ij} = p_{i \cdot}p_{\cdot j}$.
    *   Discusses **testing for independence** ($H_0: Y \perp Z$ versus $H_1: Y \not\perp Z$).
    *   Covers **Prospective Sampling (Cohort Sampling)**, where exposed and unexposed groups are observed to count the number with disease in each group.
        *   $X_{01} \sim Binomial(X_{0\cdot}, P(D|E^c))$
        *   $X_{11} \sim Binomial(X_{1\cdot}, P(D|E))$.
        *   Estimating $P(D|E)$ and $P(D|E^c)$ is possible, and $\psi$ can be estimated as a function of these probabilities.


*   **16 Causal Inference**
    *   Introduction
        *   The statement "**$X$ causes $Y$**" roughly means that changing the value of $X$ will change the distribution of $Y$.
        *   When $X$ causes $Y$, $X$ and $Y$ will be associated, but association does not necessarily imply causation.
        *   The chapter discusses two frameworks for discussing causation: **counterfactual random variables** and **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)** (presented in the next chapter).
    *   **16.1 The Counterfactual Model**
        *   Introduces the counterfactual model, where $X$ is a binary treatment variable ($X=1$ for treated, $X=0$ for not treated).
        *   Introduces **potential outcomes** $(C_0, C_1)$:
            *   $C_0$: the outcome if the subject is not treated ($X=0$).
            *   $C_1$: the outcome if the subject is treated ($X=1$).
        *   The observed outcome $Y$ is related to the potential outcomes by:
            *   $Y = C_1$ if $X = 1$.
            *   $Y = C_0$ if $X = 0$.
        *   The **causal effect** of the treatment for a single subject is $C_1 - C_0$.
        *   The **average causal effect (ACE)** or **average treatment effect (ATE)** is $\theta = E(C_1 - C_0) = E(C_1) - E(C_0)$.
        *   It is impossible to observe both $C_0$ and $C_1$ for the same subject, leading to the "**fundamental problem of causal inference**".
    *   **16.2 Identifiability**
        *   Discusses conditions under which causal effects can be estimated from observed data.
        *   If treatment $X$ is randomly assigned and independent of $(C_0, C_1)$, then:
            *   $E(C_1) = E(Y|X=1)$.
            *   $E(C_0) = E(Y|X=0)$.
            *   In this case, $\theta = E(Y|X=1) - E(Y|X=0)$ can be estimated.
        *   Example 16.2 (not fully described) is mentioned in an exercise.
        *   Theorem 16.4 is mentioned in an exercise requiring proof.
    *   **16.3 Observational Studies**
        *   Discusses the challenges of estimating causal effects in observational studies where treatment assignment is not random.
        *   In observational studies, $X$ and $(C_0, C_1)$ may be dependent due to **confounding variables**.
        *   Figure 17.11 illustrates observational studies with measured and unmeasured confounders, indicating the relevance of DAGs (from Chapter 17) to this topic.
    *   **16.4 Instrumental Variables** (Not explicitly detailed in the excerpts but likely covered)


*   **17 Directed Graphs and Conditional Independence**
    *   **17.1 Introduction**
        *   Introduces **directed graphs** consisting of nodes and arrows.
        *   Graphs are useful for **representing independence relations between variables**.
        *   They can also be used as an alternative to counterfactuals to **represent causal relationships**.
        *   The term "Bayesian network" is sometimes used for a directed graph with a probability distribution, but this is considered poor terminology.
        *   Statistical inference for directed graphs can be performed.
    *   **17.2 Conditional Independence**
        *   Discusses the concept of **conditional independence**.
    *   **17.3 DAGs**
        *   Introduces **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**.
    *   **17.4 Probability and DAGs**
        *   Explains the relationship between **probability distributions and DAGs**.
        *   For a distribution consistent with a DAG, the probability function can be factored according to the graph structure, e.g., $f(x, y, z) = f(x)f(y|x)f(z|x, y)$ for the DAG $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$.
    *   **17.5 More Independence Relations**
        *   Explores further **independence relations** implied by DAGs.
        *   Introduces the concept of an **unshielded collider**.
    *   **17.6 Estimation for DAGs**
        *   Briefly mentions the two main estimation questions for DAGs:
            *   Estimating the distribution $f$ given a DAG $G$ and data.
            *   Estimating the DAG $G$ given data.
        *   Notes that these are involved topics beyond the scope of the book.
    *   **17.7 Bibliographic Remarks**
        *   Provides references for further reading on DAGs and their applications. Mentions texts by Edwards (1995) and Jordan (2004), as well as the early work by Wright (1934) on causal DAGs and modern treatments by Spirtes et al. (2000) and Pearl (2000). Also notes discussions on the challenges of estimating causal structure from data by Robins et al. (2003).
    *   **17.8 Appendix**
        *   **Causation Revisited**: Discusses causation using DAGs as an alternative to counterfactual random variables (from Chapter 16), noting that the two approaches are mathematically equivalent.
        *   Introduces the idea of **intervention** in the context of DAGs.
        *   Provides pseudocode for generating data from a distribution consistent with a DAG.
        *   Illustrates different study designs (randomized study, observational study with measured confounders, observational study with unmeasured confounders) using DAGs in Figure 17.11.
        *   Mentions a way to make the correspondence between the DAG approach and the counterfactual approach explicit using a variable $Z$ defined based on $(C_0, C_1)$ from Chapter 16.
    *   **Theorem 17.13** states that two DAGs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are Markov equivalent if and only if (i) skeleton($G_1$) = skeleton($G_2$) and (ii) $G_1$ and $G_2$ have the same unshielded colliders.
    *   **Example 17.14** illustrates Markov equivalent DAGs.


*   **18 Undirected Graphs**
    *   **18.1 Undirected Graphs**
        *   Definition of an **undirected graph** $G = (V, E)$ with a finite set of **vertices** $V$ and a set of **edges** $E$ (unordered pairs of vertices).
        *   Vertices correspond to random variables ($X, Y, Z, \ldots$).
        *   An edge $(X, Y) \in E$ means $X$ and $Y$ are joined by an edge, written as $X \sim Y$ if $X$ and $Y$ are **adjacent**.
        *   Definition of a **path** as a sequence $X_0, \ldots, X_n$ where $X_{i-1} \sim X_i$ for each $i$.
        *   Definition of a **complete graph** (an edge between every pair of vertices).
        *   Definition of a **subgraph** (a subset $U \subset V$ of vertices together with their edges).
        *   Definition of **separation**: $C$ separates $A$ and $B$ (three distinct subsets of $V$) if every path from a variable in $A$ to a variable in $B$ intersects a variable in $C$.
    *   **18.2 Probability and Graphs**
        *   Constructing a graph based on conditional independence: no edge between $X$ and $Y$ $\iff$ $X \perp Y | \text{rest}$ (where "rest" refers to all other variables).
        *   The resulting graph is called a **pairwise Markov graph**.
        *   **Global Markov property**: if $A$ and $B$ are separated by $C$, then $X_A \perp X_B | X_C$.
        *   **Theorem 18.3**: The pairwise Markov property and the global Markov property are equivalent: $M_{pair}(G) = M_{global}(G)$.
        *   Examples of independence relations implied by different graph structures (Figures 18.3, 18.4, 18.5, 18.6, 18.7, 18.8).
        *   **Example 18.4**: Figure 18.7 implies $X \perp Y$, $X \perp Z$, and $X \perp (Y, Z)$.
        *   **Example 18.5**: Figure 18.8 implies $X \perp W | (Y, Z)$ and $X \perp Z | Y$.
    *   **18.3 Cliques and Potentials**
        *   Definition of a **clique**: a set of variables in a graph that are all adjacent to each other.
        *   Definition of a **maximal clique**: a clique where it's not possible to include another variable and still be a clique.
        *   Definition of a **potential**: any positive function.
        *   The probability function $f(x)$ for a distribution $P$ that is Markov to a graph $G$ can be written as $f(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \psi_C(x_C)$ (Equation 18.1), where $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of maximal cliques and $\psi_C(x_C)$ are positive potential functions. $Z = \sum_x \prod_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \psi_C(x_C)$ is the normalization constant.
        *   **Example 18.6**: For the graph in Figure 18.1, maximal cliques are $\{X, Y\}$ and $\{Y, Z\}$, so $f(x, y, z) \propto \psi_1(x, y) \psi_2(y, z)$.
        *   **Example 18.7**: Lists the maximal cliques for the graph in Figure 18.9 and gives the form of the probability function.
    *   **18.4 Fitting Graphs to Data**
        *   Briefly mentions the problem of finding a graphical model that fits a given data set.
        *   In the discrete case, one way to fit a graph to data is to use a **log-linear model** (the subject of Chapter 19).
    *   **18.5 Bibliographic Remarks**
        *   References thorough treatments of undirected graphs, including books by Whittaker (1990) and Lauritzen (1996).

*   **19 Log-Linear Models**
    *   Introduction to **log-linear models** for modeling multivariate discrete data.
    *   Strong connection between log-linear models and undirected graphs.
    *   **19.1 The Log-Linear Model**
        *   Let $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_m)$ be a discrete random vector with probability function $f(x) = P(X = x) = P(X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_m = x_m)$.
        *   $X_j$ takes $r_j$ values, assumed to be in $\{0, 1, \ldots, r_j - 1\}$ without loss of generality.
        *   Data can be seen as a sample from a Multinomial distribution with $N = r_1 \times r_2 \times \cdots \times r_m$ categories.
        *   $p = (p_1, \ldots, p_N)$ denotes the multinomial parameter.
        *   Definition of $x_A = (x_j : j \in A)$ for a subset $A \subset S = \{1, \ldots, m\}$.
        *   **Theorem 19.1**: The joint probability function $f(x)$ can be written as $\log f(x) = \sum_{A \subset S} \psi_A(x)$ (Equation 19.1), where $\psi_A(x)$ only depends on $x_A$ and $\psi_\emptyset(x)$ is a constant.
        *   The terms $\psi_A(x)$ are called the **log-linear parameters** or **interactions**.
        *   **Example 19.2**: Log-linear model for a Bernoulli random variable.
            *   $X \in \{0, 1\}$ with $P(X = 1) = p_1$ and $P(X = 0) = p_2 = 1 - p_1$.
            *   $\log f(x) = \psi_\emptyset(x) + \psi_{\{1\}}(x)$.
            *   $\psi_\emptyset(x) = \log(p_2)$ and $\psi_{\{1\}}(x) = x \log(\frac{p_1}{p_2})$.
        *   **Example 19.3**: Log-linear model for $X = (X_1, X_2)$ where $X_1 \in \{0, 1\}$ and $X_2 \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, connected to a multinomial with 6 categories.
    *   **19.2 Graphical Log-Linear Models**
        *   Connection between log-linear models and undirected graphs: a log-linear model is graphical with respect to a graph $G$ if $\psi_A(x) = 0$ whenever the indices in $A$ form a set that is not a clique in $G$.
        *   **Theorem 19.4**: Let $G$ be an undirected graph with vertex set $S = \{1, \ldots, m\}$. A probability distribution $f$ factors according to $G$ (i.e., $f(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \psi_C(x_C)$ where $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of maximal cliques) if and only if its log-linear expansion $\log f(x) = \sum_{A \subset S} \psi_A(x)$ satisfies $\psi_A = 0$ whenever $A$ is not a clique in $G$.
        *   **Lemma 19.5**: A partition $(X_a, X_b, X_c)$ satisfies $X_b \perp X_c | X_a$ if and only if $f(x_a, x_b, x_c) = g(x_a, x_b)h(x_a, x_c)$ for some functions $g$ and $h$.
        *   Proof of Theorem 19.4 using Lemma 19.5.
        *   If a term can be added to the model without changing the graph, the model is not graphical.
        *   **Example 19.6**: Graphical log-linear model corresponding to a path graph.
        *   **Example 19.7**: Graphical log-linear model corresponding to a more complex graph (Figure 19.1).
    *   **19.3 Hierarchical Log-Linear Models**
        *   Definition of **hierarchical log-linear models**: $\psi_A = 0$ and $A \subset B$ implies that $\psi_B = 0$.
        *   **Lemma 19.9**: A graphical model is hierarchical, but the reverse is not necessarily true.
        *   **Example 19.10**: A hierarchical and graphical model.
        *   **Example 19.11**: A hierarchical but not graphical model (complete graph).
        *   **Example 19.12**: A model that is not hierarchical and therefore not graphical.
    *   **19.4 Model Generators**
        *   Hierarchical models can be written succinctly using **generators**.
        *   Example: $M = 1.2 + 1.3$ stands for $\log f = \psi_\emptyset + \psi_1 + \psi_2 + \psi_3 + \psi_{12} + \psi_{13}$.
        *   The generator $M = 1.2.3$ is the saturated model.
    *   **19.5 Fitting Log-Linear Models to Data**
        *   Given $n$ random vectors from a multinomial distribution, the log-likelihood function can be expressed in terms of the log-linear parameters $\beta$.
        *   Maximum likelihood estimates (mle) $\hat{\beta}$ generally found numerically.
        *   Fisher information matrix also found numerically, allowing estimation of standard errors.
        *   Model selection problem: which $\psi$ terms to include, similar to variable selection in linear regression.

*   **20 Nonparametric Curve Estimation**
    *   Discussion of **nonparametric estimation** of probability density functions and regression functions (curve estimation or smoothing).
    *   Contrast with estimating cumulative distribution functions, which can be done consistently without smoothness assumptions.
    *   Need for **smoothing** due to bias-variance tradeoff.
    *   **20.1 The Bias-Variance Tradeoff**
        *   Fundamental challenge in curve estimation: balancing **bias** and **variance**.
        *   Oversmoothing leads to high bias and low variance.
        *   Undersmoothing leads to low bias and high variance.
    *   **20.2 Histograms**
        *   Histogram as an example of a density estimator.
        *   Dividing the real line into disjoint sets called **bins**.
        *   Histogram estimator is a piecewise constant function with height proportional to the number of observations in each bin.
        *   **Smoothing parameter**: number of bins (or binwidth).
        *   Formal definition for iid data on $$ with density $f$, using $m$ bins $B_j$ of width $h = 1/m$ (Equation 20.7).
        *   $\nu_j$: number of observations in $B_j$.
        *   $\hat{p}_j = \nu_j / n$.
        *   $p_j = \int_{B_j} f(u) du$.
        *   **Histogram estimator**: $\hat{f}_n(x) = \hat{p}_j / h$ for $x \in B_j$ (Equation 20.8).
        *   **Theorem 20.3**: Mean and variance of $\hat{f}_n(x)$:
            *   $E(\hat{f}_n(x)) = p_j / h$ (Equation 20.9).
            *   $V(\hat{f}_n(x)) = p_j(1 - p_j) / (nh^2)$ (Equation 20.9).
        *   Integrated Squared Error (ISE) as a measure of risk: $R(f, \hat{f}_n) = \int (f(x) - \hat{f}_n(x))^2 dx$ (Equation 20.10).
        *   Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE): $E[R(f, \hat{f}_n)] = \int E[(f(x) - \hat{f}_n(x))^2] dx = \int Bias^2(\hat{f}_n(x)) dx + \int Var(\hat{f}_n(x)) dx$.
        *   Approximate MISE for histograms (Equation 20.11).
        *   Optimal bandwidth $h_{opt} \propto n^{-1/3}$ and optimal number of bins $m_{opt} \propto n^{1/3}$ (Equation 20.12).
        *   Cross-validation for choosing the number of bins.
        *   Cross-validation score $\hat{J}(h)$ (Equation 20.13).
        *   **Theorem 20.7**: Identity for $\hat{J}(h)$:
            *   $\hat{J}(h) = \frac{2}{(n-1)h} - \frac{n+1}{h(n-1)} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \hat{p}_j^2$ (Equation 20.14).
        *   **Example 20.8**: Cross-validation for astronomy data.
        *   Confidence bands for histograms.
        *   **Theorem 20.10**: Approximate $1 - \alpha$ confidence band $(\hat{l}_n(x), \hat{u}_n(x))$ where:
            *   $\hat{l}_n(x) = (\max\{\sqrt{\hat{f}_n(x)} - c, 0 \})^2$ (Equation 20.17).
            *   $\hat{u}_n(x) = (\sqrt{\hat{f}_n(x)} + c)^2$ (Equation 20.17).
            *   $c = z_{\alpha/(2m)} \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{n}}$ (Equation 20.18).
    *   **20.3 Kernel Density Estimation**
        *   Kernel density estimator $\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K(\frac{x - X_i}{h})$ (Equation 20.20).
        *   $K$: kernel function.
        *   $h$: bandwidth (smoothing parameter).
        *   **Example 20.9**: Gaussian kernel.
        *   Expectation and variance of kernel density estimator (Equations 20.21 and 20.22).
        *   Approximate bias and variance (Equations 20.23 and 20.24).
        *   Approximate MISE for kernel density estimation (Equation 20.25).
        *   Optimal bandwidth $h_{opt} \propto n^{-1/5}$ (Equation 20.26).
        *   Choice of kernel function is less critical than the choice of bandwidth.
        *   Cross-validation for bandwidth selection.
    *   **20.4 Nonparametric Regression**

    *   **22.1 Introduction**
        *   Definition of classification as supervised learning, predicting a discrete $Y$ from $X$.
        *   Terminology mapping from statistics to computer science:
            *   classification $\leftrightarrow$ supervised learning
            *   predicting a discrete $Y$ from $X$ $\leftrightarrow$
            *   data training sample $(X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$ $\leftrightarrow$
            *   covariates $\leftrightarrow$ features the $X_i$'s
            *   classifier $\leftrightarrow$ hypothesis map $h: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$
            *   estimation $\leftrightarrow$ learning finding a good classifier.
    *   **22.2 Error Rates and the Bayes Classifier**
        *   Goal: find a classification rule $h$ that makes accurate predictions.
        *   Definitions:
            *   Classification rule $h: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ (for binary case).
            *   Loss function $L(h) = P(h(X) \neq Y)$ (probability of misclassification or error rate).
            *   Observed error rate $\hat{L}_n(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n I(h(X_i) \neq Y_i)$.
            *   Regression function $r(x) = E(Y|X = x) = P(Y = 1|X = x)$ (for $Y \in \{0, 1\}$).
        *   **Bayes Classifier** $h^*(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } P(Y = 1|X = x) > P(Y = 0|X = x) \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$ (Equation 22.5).
        *   Alternative form of Bayes Classifier: $h^*(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \pi f_1(x) > (1 - \pi) f_0(x) \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$ (Equation 22.6), where $\pi = P(Y = 1)$ and $f_k(x)$ is the density of $X$ given $Y = k$.
        *   **Theorem 22.5**: The Bayes rule is optimal, $L(h^*) \le L(h)$ for any other classification rule $h$.
        *   Three main approaches to approximate the Bayes rule when unknown quantities are involved:
            *   Empirical Risk Minimization: Choose a set of classifiers $H$ and find $\hat{h} \in H$ that minimizes some estimate of $L(h)$.
            *   Regression: Find an estimate $\hat{r}$ of the regression function $r$ and define $\hat{h}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \hat{r}(x) > 1/2 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$.
            *   Density Estimation: Estimate $f_0$ and $f_1$, let $\hat{\pi} = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$, define $\hat{r}(x) = \frac{\hat{\pi} \hat{f}_1(x)}{\hat{\pi} \hat{f}_1(x) + (1 - \hat{\pi}) \hat{f}_0(x)}$, and use $\hat{h}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \hat{r}(x) > 1/2 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$.
        *   **Theorem 22.6**: For $Y \in \mathcal{Y} = \{1, \ldots, K\}$, the optimal rule is $h^*(x) = \arg\max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} P(Y = y|X = x)$.

        *   $w = \Sigma^{-1}(\mu_1 - \mu_0)$ and $c = \frac{1}{2} (\mu_1 + \mu_0)^T \Sigma^{-1} (\mu_1 - \mu_0) - \log(\frac{\pi_1}{\pi_0})$.
        *   Estimating $\mu_k$ with sample means $\bar{X}_k$ and $\Sigma$ with pooled sample covariance $S_W$.
        *   Fisher's discriminant analysis: find a linear combination $U = w^T X$ such that the classes are well separated.
        *   Optimizing $J(w) = \frac{w^T B w}{w^T W w}$, where $B$ is between-class scatter and $W$ is within-class scatter.
        *   Solution $w \propto S_W^{-1} (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_0)$.
        *   Fisher linear discriminant function $U = w^T X = (\bar{X}_0 - \bar{X}_1)^T S_W^{-1} X$.
        *   Midpoint $m = \frac{1}{2} (\bar{X}_0 + \bar{X}_1)^T S_W^{-1} (\bar{X}_0 - \bar{X}_1)$.
        *   Fisher's classification rule $h(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } w^T x \ge m \\ 1 & \text{if } w^T x < m \end{cases}$.

    *   **22.4 Linear Regression and Logistic Regression**
        *   Direct approach: estimate $r(x) = E(Y|X = x)$ and classify using $\hat{h}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \hat{r}(x) > 1/2 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$.
        *   Linear regression model $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, with $\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$ and predicted values $\hat{Y} = X\hat{\beta}$.

    *   **22.5 Relationship Between Logistic Regression and LDA**
    *   **22.6 Density Estimation and Naive Bayes**
        *   Naive Bayes classifier assumes conditional independence of features given the class label: $f(x|Y=k) = \prod_{j=1}^d f_j(x_j|Y=k)$.
    *   **22.7 Trees**
        *   Classification trees partition the feature space into rectangular regions.
        *   Prediction is constant within each region.

## Frequently Asked Questions 

1. What are probability inequalities and why are they important in statistics?

Probability inequalities, as discussed in Chapter 4, provide bounds on the probability of certain events occurring. These inequalities, such as Markov's inequality, Chebyshev's inequality, and Jensen's inequality, are crucial because they allow us to make statements about the likelihood of events even when the exact probability distribution is unknown or complex. They are fundamental tools for understanding the concentration of probability mass and for deriving other statistical results, particularly in the study of the behavior of random variables.

2. What are the different modes of convergence for random variables, as outlined in Chapter 5?

Chapter 5 details several ways in which a sequence of random variables can converge to a limiting random variable or a constant. The main types of convergence discussed are:

Convergence in probability: The probability that the difference between the random variable and its limit exceeds any small positive number approaches zero as the sequence progresses.
Almost sure convergence (or convergence with probability 1): The sequence of random variables converges pointwise to its limit for all outcomes except for a set of probability zero.
Convergence in mean square: The expected squared difference between the random variable and its limit approaches zero.
Convergence in distribution (or weak convergence): The cumulative distribution functions of the sequence of random variables converge pointwise to the cumulative distribution function of the limit at all points where the limit distribution function is continuous.
These different modes of convergence have distinct implications and are used in various contexts within statistical theory.

3. What are the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, and why are they central to statistical inference?

The Law of Large Numbers (LLN), presented in Chapter 5, essentially states that the sample average of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables will converge to the true population mean. This theorem provides the theoretical justification for using sample means to estimate population means.

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT), also in Chapter 5, is another cornerstone of statistics. It states that the sum (or average) of a large number of i.i.d. random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original distribution, provided certain conditions are met. The CLT is vital because it allows us to make probabilistic statements and construct statistical inferences (like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) about population parameters, even when the underlying distribution is not normal.

4. What are the primary goals of point estimation, confidence sets, and hypothesis testing, as introduced in Chapter 6?

Chapter 6 lays the groundwork for statistical inference.

Point estimation aims to find a single "best" value to estimate an unknown population parameter based on observed sample data.
Confidence sets (specifically confidence intervals in the one-dimensional case) provide a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter, along with a measure of confidence that the true parameter lies within that range.
Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure used to decide between two competing claims (hypotheses) about a population parameter, based on evidence from a sample. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and then using data to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
5. How can we estimate the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and what are statistical functionals, as discussed in Chapter 7?

Chapter 7 introduces methods for understanding the distribution of data. The empirical distribution function (EDF) is a non-parametric estimator of the true cdf, based directly on the observed sample. It assigns a probability of 1/n to each observed data point and is a step function that jumps at the values of the data points.

Statistical functionals are functions of the cdf. Many important statistical parameters and estimators can be expressed as functionals of the underlying distribution. Examples include the mean, variance, quantiles, and correlation. Studying statistical functionals provides a unified way to analyze the properties of various estimators.

6. What is the bootstrap method and how can it be used for variance estimation and constructing confidence intervals, as detailed in Chapter 8?

The bootstrap is a powerful resampling technique, explained in Chapter 8, used to estimate the sampling distribution of an estimator. It works by repeatedly drawing random samples with replacement from the original data to create many "bootstrap samples." By calculating the estimator of interest for each bootstrap sample, we can approximate the variance of the estimator and construct bootstrap confidence intervals. This method is particularly useful when analytical methods for calculating variance or constructing confidence intervals are difficult or unavailable, especially for complex estimators or small sample sizes. The jackknife, a related technique for bias and variance estimation, is also mentioned in the appendix of this chapter.

7. What are the method of moments and maximum likelihood estimation, and what are some important properties of maximum likelihood estimators, as covered in Chapter 9?

Chapter 9 focuses on parametric inference. The method of moments is a technique for estimating parameters of a probability distribution by equating sample moments (like the sample mean and sample variance) to their corresponding population moments (expressed as functions of the parameters) and solving for the parameters.

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is another widely used method. It involves finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, which represents the probability of observing the given sample data under different possible parameter values. MLEs often have desirable asymptotic properties, such as consistency (converging to the true parameter as the sample size increases) and asymptotic normality. The delta method, also mentioned, is a technique for approximating the distribution of a function of an estimator, often used in conjunction with MLEs.

8. What are the Wald test and p-values, as introduced in Chapter 10 in the context of hypothesis testing?

Chapter 10 delves into hypothesis testing. The Wald test is a statistical test used to assess hypotheses about parameters in statistical models, often based on the maximum likelihood estimator. It compares the estimated parameter value to the hypothesized value, taking into account the estimated variance of the estimator.

A p-value is a measure of the statistical significance of an observed result in hypothesis testing. It is defined as the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value provides evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection if the p-value is below a predetermined significance level (alpha).
