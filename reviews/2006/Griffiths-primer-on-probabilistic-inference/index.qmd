    title='Martha White - Developing Reinforcement Learning Agents that Learn Many Subtasks?' >}}

Talk at Waterloo.AI by Martha White on Developing Reinforcement Learning Agents that Learn Many Subtasks. She makes the case for the life long problem setting and discusses recent research on learning multiple tasks (options and GVFs) in parallel.

> "Probabilistic models can capture the structure of extremely complex problems, but as the structure of the model becomes richer, probabilistic inference becomes harder.." [Mandelbrot highlights the inadequacy of models ignoring extreme price movements, emphasizing the need for a framework that can accommodate them.]{.mark} --- [@griffiths2008primer] introduction.

I think that this work may be used as a starting point for a framework for building a cognitive substrate for RL agents that can learn multiple tasks in parallel. 

My thinking is along the lines that the RL agents can learn at a number of levels.

Policies, Value functions, Options, Reward models, 

To generalize though beyond tabular methods presents a number of challenges that might be addressed by the probabilistic models. Rules, and Grammars may be modeled as trees, etc and could greatly benefit from both priors and the ability to assemble into hierarchies.

### Abstract

> Research in computer science, engineering, mathematics and statistics has produced a variety of tools that are useful in developing probabilistic models of human cognition. We provide an introduction to the principles of probabilistic inference that are used in the papers appearing in this special issue. We lay out the basic principles that underlie probabilistic models in detail, and then briefly survey some of the tools that can be used in applying these models to human cognition
