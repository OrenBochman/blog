Inductive Inference
: The process of reasoning from specific observations or examples to more general conclusions or theories.

Bayesian Inference
: A method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a 
hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Prior Probability (Prior)
: The initial probability assigned to a hypothesis before any data is observed, reflecting prior knowledge or beliefs.

Likelihood
: The probability of observing the given data under a specific hypothesis and background theory.

Posterior Probability (Posterior)
: The updated probability of a hypothesis after considering the observed data, calculated using Bayes' theorem (proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood).

Intuitive Theory
: A system of related concepts, causal laws, structural constraints, or explanatory principles that guide inductive inference in a particular domain of knowledge.

Structured Probabilistic Model
: A formal representation of an intuitive theory that defines a probability distribution over possible observables, often based on a graph structure capturing relationships.

Taxonomy
: A hierarchical system of classification, often represented as a tree structure, used to organize categories and concepts.

Size Principle
: The tendency in Bayesian learning for smaller, more specific hypotheses to be increasingly preferred over larger, more general hypotheses as more randomly sampled examples are observed.

Causal Graphical Model
: A probabilistic model that represents causal relationships between variables using a graph where nodes represent variables and edges represent direct causal influences.

Causal Grammar
: A formal system, inspired by linguistic grammars, that generates causal graphical models based on an ontology and a set of causal laws.

Hierarchical Bayesian Model
: A Bayesian model with multiple levels of parameters, where the priors for lower-level parameters are themselves governed by higher-level parameters, allowing for learning at different levels of abstraction.
