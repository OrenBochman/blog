This paper uses lots of big terms so let's break them down so we can understand them better

Action Understanding
: The cognitive process by which individuals interpret and make sense of the actions performed by themselves and others.

Bayesian Model
: A statistical model that uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Bounded Rationality
: The idea that agents' decision-making capabilities are limited by factors such as available information, cognitive constraints, and time, leading to choices that are "good enough" rather than perfectly optimal.

Computational Model
: A mathematical or algorithmic representation of a cognitive process or phenomenon, allowing for simulation and quantitative predictions.

Dynamic Bayes Network (DBN)
: A probabilistic graphical model used to represent the temporal dependencies between variables, often used to model systems that change over time.

Hypothesis Space
: The set of all possible explanations or interpretations that an observer might consider when trying to infer an agent's goal.

Marginalization
: In probability, the process of summing or integrating over the values of one or more variables to obtain the probability distribution of the remaining variables.

Online Inference
: The process of drawing conclusions or making judgments in real-time as new information becomes available.
Peer Reviewed: A process by which scholarly work is evaluated by other experts in the same field before publication to ensure quality and rigor.

Prior Knowledge
: Pre-existing beliefs, expectations, or information that an observer has about the world or the agent being observed, which is used to inform the process of inference.

Rational Analysis
: An approach in cognitive science that seeks to understand behavior by determining what would be the optimal strategy for an agent to achieve its goals given the constraints of the environment and the agent's cognitive abilities.

Retrospective Inference
: The process of making judgments or drawing conclusions about past events or states based on information that became available after those events occurred.

State Transition Distribution
: A function that specifies the probability of moving from one state to another as a result of taking a particular action in a given environment.

Teleological Representation
: Understanding actions and events in terms of their purposes or goals.
