- Introduction
  - Presents an example of goal inference from behavior and points out how common this activity is in daily life.
  - Highlights previous studies about infants performing goal inference.
  - Discusses the challenges in explaining goal inference and argues against prior qualitative explanations.
- Inverse Planning Framework
  - Describes the inverse planning framework in detail.
  - Explains the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to formalize rational planning and decision making.
  - Presents three candidate models for goal inference (M1, M2, and M3), differing in their assumptions about goal structure.
    - Model 1: Single Underlying Goal
      - Presents M1, a model that assumes a single invariant goal throughout a trajectory.
      - Describes how M1 accounts for deviations from optimal behavior as noise or bounded rationality.
      - Explains the use of Bayes' rule to infer the agent's goal based on observed state sequences.
    - Model 2: Complex Goals
      - Presents M2, a model that assumes agents can pursue complex goals with subgoals.
      - Discusses the prior probability of complex goals and how it is incorporated into the model.
      - Describes the inference process for end goals, involving marginalization over goal types and possible via-points.
    - Model 3: Changing Goals
      - Presents M3, a dynamic model that allows agents' goals to change over time.
      - Explains how the probability of goal changes is controlled by a parameter and how it affects the model's predictions.
      - Describes the use of a Dynamic Bayes net to represent goal changes and compute posterior distributions over goals.
      - Presents the use of a variant of the forward-backward algorithm to compute the marginal probability of a goal at a specific time.
- Experiments
  - Briefly explains that two experiments were designed to test and compare the three inverse planning models.
    - Experiment 1
      - Describes Experiment 1, which investigated people's goal inferences from partial action sequences.
      - Presents the experimental design, including participants, stimuli, and procedure.
      - Explains the predictions of each model for Experiment 1 and how they differ.
      - Discusses the results of Experiment 1, summarizing the correlations between model predictions and human judgments.
    - Experiment 2  
      - Describes Experiment 2, which focused on distinguishing the predictions of M2 and M3 using retrospective judgments.
      - Presents the experimental design, including participants, stimuli, and procedure.
      - Explains the contrasting predictions of M2 and M3 for Experiment 2.
      - Discusses the results of Experiment 2, highlighting the superior performance of M3 in predicting human judgments.
- Discussion
  - Discusses the implications of the experimental results, supporting the inverse planning framework and M3.
  - Acknowledges limitations of the study and suggests future directions, such as incorporating other goal structures.
  - Relates the inverse planning framework to theory-theory and simulation theory.
  - Emphasizes the importance of the rationality assumption and rich goal structure representations in explaining goal inference.
- Conclusion
  - Summarizes the main contributions of the paper, including the presentation and testing of an inverse planning framework for goal inference.
  - Highlights the empirical support for the framework and the importance of the changing goals model.
  - Briefly discusses the broader implications of the findings for understanding human reasoning about actions and goals.
