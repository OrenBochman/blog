## TL;DR

## Abstract

Abstract Transfer of information between senders and receivers, of one kind or
another, is essential to all life. David Lewis introduced a game theoretic model of the
simplest case, where one sender and one receiver have pure common interest. How
hard or easy is it for evolution to achieve information transfer in Lewis signaling?. The
answers involve surprising subtleties. We discuss some if these in terms of evolutionary
dynamics in both finite and infinite populations, with and without mutation.


## This paper 

I've not looked too deeply into this paper as it needs a deep dive into evolutionary dynamics 
which I've yet to study in depth. My interests are RL and complex signaling systems. 
Some of the results in evolutionary dynamics can be directly applied to reinforcement learning. 

The paper looks at moran processes and mutations. This is interesting in the open ended setting 
of language evolution.


> Because this is a partnership game, average payoff is a **Lyapunov function** ^[**Lyapunov functions** are scalar functions that may be used to prove the stability of an equilibrium of an ODE]  for the system [in fact, it is even a potential function; see [@hofbauer1998evolutionary] ].

The look at Lyapunov functions and the replicator dynamics. This is interesting in the context 
stability of equilibria in signaling games. 

> raises the same questions in the context of evolution in finite populations with fixed population size (via the Moran process with and without mutation)
