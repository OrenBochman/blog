This paper uses lots of big terms so let's break them down so we can understand them better

Algorithm
: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. In this context, referring to the computational process of the IPE.

Analytic Solutions
: Exact, closed-form mathematical solutions to a problem, often derived through symbolic manipulation of equations. The IPE avoids these in favor of simulation.

Artifact
: A human-made object. Understanding the physics of artifacts is a key aspect of physical scene understanding.

Cognitive Mechanism
: A process or system within the mind responsible for a particular aspect of cognition. The IPE is proposed as one such mechanism.

Computational Underpinnings
: The algorithms, data structures, and principles that underlie a cognitive ability or process. The paper seeks to understand the computational underpinnings of physical scene understanding.

Deterministic
: A process or model where the outcome is uniquely determined by the initial conditions, without any element of randomness or uncertainty. Ground truth physics simulations in the paper are treated as deterministic.

Heuristics
: Simple, efficient rules or strategies used to make decisions or solve problems quickly, often by sacrificing optimality for speed. The paper considers whether people might rely on non-simulation-based heuristics.

Illusions
: Perceptions or judgments that systematically deviate from reality. The IPE's probabilistic nature helps explain certain physical illusions.

Inference
: The process of drawing conclusions or making predictions based on evidence and reasoning. Physical scene understanding involves rapid physical inferences.

Latent Forces
: Unseen or hidden forces that might be acting on objects in a scene (e.g., a subtle breeze). The IPE incorporates uncertainty about these.

Monte Carlo Simulation
: A computational technique that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The IPE uses Monte Carlo simulations to represent and propagate uncertainty.

Newtonian Mechanics
: The classical laws of motion and gravitation formulated by Isaac Newton. The paper discusses how human intuitions relate to Newtonian standards.

Object-Based Representation
: A way of representing a scene by identifying and characterizing the individual objects within it, including their properties and relationships. The IPE uses an object-based representation.

Perceptuomotor Systems
: Sensory and motor systems and their integration, involved in perceiving the environment and acting upon it. The IPE is proposed to interface with these systems.

Posterior Distribution
: In Bayesian statistics, the probability distribution of a parameter after observing data, reflecting updated beliefs. The IPE aims to form an approximate posterior distribution over future states.

Prior Knowledge
: Pre-existing knowledge or beliefs that influence how new information is interpreted. Simplified geometric priors are mentioned in the context of mass distribution estimation.

Psychophysical Tasks
: Experiments designed to study the relationship between physical stimuli and sensory experiences and perceptions. The paper describes several psychophysical tasks used to test the IPE model.

Qualitative Reasoning
: Reasoning about the general properties and relationships of a system without necessarily using precise quantitative values. Earlier AI systems focused on qualitative physical reasoning.

Quantitative Approach
: An approach that emphasizes precise measurement and numerical analysis. The IPE model takes a more quantitative approach to mental models.

Robust
: Able to function effectively despite noise, errors, or variations in input. The IPE's probabilistic nature is intended to make it robust to noisy perception.

Sensorimotor Outputs
: Actions or behaviors generated by the motor system in response to sensory input and cognitive processing. Experiment 5 included sensorimotor outputs.

Stochastic
: Involving randomness or probability. The IPE runs stochastic simulations.

Veridicality
: The quality of being truthful or accurate in representing reality. The IPE intentionally trades some veridicality for speed and generality.
