This book/paper uses lots of big terms so let's break them down so we can understand them better

Signaling Game
: A game theory model that analyzes strategic interactions involving the transmission of information from a sender to a receiver through signals, with payoffs depending on the state of the world, the signal sent, and the action taken by the receiver.

Lewis Signaling Game
: A basic type of signaling game where the interests of the sender and the receiver are perfectly aligned; the goal is for the receiver to take an action that matches the true state of the world known by the sender.

Costly Signaling
: A signaling mechanism where the signal itself imposes a cost on the sender. This cost can be state-dependent or fixed and can potentially ensure the honesty of the signal if higher costs are associated with misrepresentation.

Replicator Dynamics
: A fundamental model in evolutionary game theory that describes how the frequency of strategies in a population changes over time based on their relative success (payoff). Strategies with higher-than-average payoffs increase in proportion.

Moran Process
: A model of evolutionary dynamics in finite populations where, at each step, an individual is randomly chosen to die and is replaced by a copy of another individual chosen with probability proportional to their fitness.

Nash Equilibrium
: A state in a game where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.

Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)
: A strategy that, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any rare mutant strategy.

Pareto Optimal Nash Equilibrium
: A Nash equilibrium where there is no other outcome that makes at least one player better off without making any player worse off.

Partial Pooling Equilibrium
: An equilibrium in a signaling game where some signals are sent in multiple states of the world, and some actions are taken in response to multiple signals, resulting in imperfect information transfer.

Selection Mutation Dynamics
: A variation of the replicator dynamics that incorporates a small probability of mutation, where individuals randomly switch to other available strategies.

Hybrid Equilibrium
: In costly signaling games, an equilibrium where senders mix between sending signals truthfully and untruthfully, and receivers sometimes respond to signals and sometimes ignore them.

Reinforcement Learning
: A type of learning where individuals adjust their behavior based on past rewards or payoffs, increasing the likelihood of choosing actions that have been successful in the past.

Lyapunov Function
: A function whose value decreases along the trajectories of a dynamical system, often used to prove the stability of equilibrium points.

Strange Attractor
: A bounded region in the state space of a dynamical system that attracts nearby trajectories but exhibits chaotic behavior, meaning trajectories within it diverge exponentially over time.

Fixation Probability
: In finite population models, the probability that a single mutant individual carrying a particular strategy will eventually spread through the entire population, replacing all other strategies.

Pooling Equilibrium
: An equilibrium in a signaling game where the sender sends the same signal regardless of the state of the world, providing no information to the receiver.

Separating Equilibrium
: An equilibrium in a signaling game where the sender sends a different signal for each different state of the world, allowing the receiver to perfectly infer the state.

Synonyms (in signaling)
: Different signals that are used to represent the same state.

Information Bottleneck (in signaling)
: Multiple different states that are represented by the same signal.
