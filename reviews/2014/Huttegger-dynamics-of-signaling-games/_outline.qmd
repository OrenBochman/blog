- Replicator Dynamics
  - Describes the replicator dynamics as the fundamental model of evolutionary game theory.
  - Presents both one-population and two-population replicator dynamics.
  - Notes that the replicator dynamics in signaling games is often not structurally stable, making it important to study the effects of perturbations such as mutation.
  - Discusses the selection mutation dynamics as a plausible perturbation to the replicator dynamics.
- Lewis Signaling Games
  - Presents the replicator dynamics of Lewis signaling games, noting that signaling systems are locally asymptotically stable but other stable rest points may exist.
  - Discusses the existence and stability of partial pooling equilibria in Lewis signaling games with more than two signals, states, and acts.
  - Highlights the instability of interior rest points ("tower of Babel" situations) in all Lewis signaling games.
  - Describes the selection mutation dynamics of Lewis signaling games, noting the dependence of outcomes on mutation parameters.
- Costly Signaling Games
  - Presents the replicator dynamics of costly signaling games such as the Spence game and the Sir Philip Sidney game.
  - Discusses the existence and stability of pooling, separating, and hybrid equilibria in these games.
  - Highlights the significance of hybrid equilibria as evolutionarily stable outcomes with partial information transfer at low costs.
  - Notes that hybrid equilibria remain stable under perturbations of the replicator dynamics, suggesting their theoretical and empirical relevance.
- Opposed Interests
  - Presents the two-population replicator dynamics of signaling games with completely opposed interests.
  - Notes that no signaling equilibrium exists in these games.
  - Highlights the emergence of information transfer off equilibrium due to the existence of a strange attractor in the interior of the state space.
- Finite Population Dynamics
  - Describes the frequency-dependent Moran process as a model of evolution in finite populations.
  - Presents the fixation probability of a mutant strategy in a monomorphic population.
  - Discusses Lewis signaling games under the Moran process, where perfectly informative signaling strategies are evolutionarily favored under weak selection.
- Costly Signaling Games
  - Presents the Moran process with mutation, where new individuals can adopt a random strategy with a small probability.
  - Discusses a two-state, two-signal, two-act signaling game with conflicting interests, noting that the population spends a significant amount of time signaling informatively despite the absence of a Nash equilibrium supporting such behavior.
  - Highlights the importance of non-Nash play in finite populations with rare mutations.
  - Describes the role of cost-free preplay signaling in promoting cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games.
- Reinforcement Learning
  - Describes reinforcement learning as a model of individual learning where players adjust their strategies based on past payoffs.
  - Presents the Herrnstein–Roth–Erev reinforcement learning model.
  - Discusses the convergence properties of reinforcement learning in Lewis signaling games, noting that convergence to a signaling system is guaranteed only in the simplest case.
  - Highlights the emergence of suboptimal equilibria containing synonyms and information bottlenecks in more general Lewis signaling games.
- Discussion
  - Summarizes the findings on the replicator dynamics, highlighting the dependence of signaling outcomes on population size, mutation rates, and the alignment of interests.
  - Emphasizes the possibility of information transfer off equilibrium in games with conflicting interests.
  - Notes the importance of non-Nash play in finite populations and the potential for reinforcement learning to lead to both optimal and suboptimal signaling equilibria.
  - Concludes that the explanatory significance of signaling equilibria depends on the underlying dynamics, and that natural dynamics may not always select a Pareto optimal outcome.
