## TL;DR

In [@DBLP:journals/corr/IoffeS15] the authors Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy proposed a method to accelerate the training of deep neural networks by reducing internal covariate shift. The method consists of normalizing the activations of each layer to have zero mean and unit variance. This is done by introducing a normalization step right after the linear transformation in the network. The method is called Batch Normalization and it allows for higher learning rates and less careful initialization.

## Abstract

> Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.

## Covariate Shift

Covariate shift is a phenomenon that occurs when the input distribution of a model changes during training. This can slow down the training process and make it harder to train models with saturating nonlinearities.

## Review

Batch Normalization is a powerful technique that can significantly accelerate the training of deep neural networks. By normalizing the activations of each layer to have zero mean and unit variance, the method reduces internal covariate shift and allows for higher learning rates and less careful initialization. This makes it easier to train models with saturating nonlinearities and can eliminate the need for Dropout in some cases. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Normalization on a state-of-the-art image classification model, achieving the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps and beating the original model by a significant margin. By using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, they improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification, reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error and 4.8% test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.
