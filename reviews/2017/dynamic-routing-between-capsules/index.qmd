### Abstract

> A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation
parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or an object part. We use
the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and
its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level
make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of
higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule
becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule
system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better
than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these
results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule
prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big
scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.
