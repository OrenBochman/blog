<!-- LEDE personal context why I reviewed this source -->

The abstract suggests a framework for evolutions of games. So I had high hopes, but on first reading it I felt that the paper was a difficult read, and rather vexing. I later noitced that the paper has some intriguing concepts that some other papers have tried to build on. These are "Template Transfer", "Modular Composition" and "Polymerization". 
Later I was writing up a couple of research notes I had found myself delving into ideas that in retrospect seem rather similar ideas from this paper.

I decided to give it another go and see if I could make sense of it. I decided to write a review of the paper to help me understand it better and to perhaps solidify my own ideas.

Note: there is another paper on "self assembling networks" which seems to

### Abstract

> Abstract. We consider how cue-reading, sensory-manipulation, and signaling games may initially evolve from ritualized decisions and how more complex games may evolve from simpler games by polymerization, template transfer, and modular composition. Modular composition is a process that combines simpler games into more complex games. Template transfer, a process by which a game is appropriated to a context other than the one in which it initially evolved, is one mechanism for modular composition. And polymerization is a particularly salient example of modular composition where simpler games evolve to form more complex chains. We also consider how the evolution of new capacities by modular composition may be more efficient than evolving those capacities from basic decisions.
