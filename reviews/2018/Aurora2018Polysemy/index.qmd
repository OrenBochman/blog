My interest in this paper is to try to get a better mathematical intuition on word embeddings. This model is mentioned in the follow up papers on word sense embeddings. A bayesian formulation of the log-linear model can be useful to develop better representations for Bayesian or RL agents that can derive distributional semantics of thier environment.

## Some questions

some questions before reading this paper about word embeddings:

Word embeddings are defined in live in a high-dimensional space with (300-2000) dimensions, how do they overcome the curse of dimensionality? ^[Hint: perhaps they exist in much lower-dimensional manifolds within the high-dimensional space]

## TL;DR

This paper introduces a Bayesian dynamic log-linear topic generative model for word embeddings. This paper is long (33 pages) and contains mathematical derivations. 


### Abstract

> Word embeddings are ubiquitous in NLP and information retrieval, but it is unclear what they represent when the word is polysemous. Here it is shown that multiple word senses reside in linear superposition within the word embedding and simple sparse coding can re cover vectors that approximately capture the senses. The success of our approach, which applies to several embedding methods, is mathematically explained using a variant of the random walk on discourses model (@arora2015latent). A novel aspect of our technique is that each extracted word sense is accompanied by one of about 2000 "discourse atoms" that gives a succinct description of which other words co-occur with that word sense. Discourse atoms can be of independent interest, and make the method potentially more useful. Empirical tests are used to verify and support the theory
