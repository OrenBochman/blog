## TL;DR

This paper introduces Flexora, a flexible low-rank approach to learning graph representations. Flexora is a general framework that can be used to learn graph representations with different objectives, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. The key idea behind Flexora is to factorize the adjacency matrix of a graph into two low-rank matrices, which can be used to learn node embeddings. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Flexora on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

### Abstract

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in
artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model 
parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization 
ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, 
their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually 
hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. 
Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used 
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to 
expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would 
underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential 
overfitting on these tasks.
> To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of
LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora)
method to automatically and flexibly select the most important 
layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance 
on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora
firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined
hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses
it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally
selects the most useful layers based on the optimized 
hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pre-trained
models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able
to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating
the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally
provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies 
to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora
