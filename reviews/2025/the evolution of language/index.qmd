## TL;DR

This paper looks at language evolution through the lens of error correction. I think this idea can be easily incorportated into the Lewis signaling game. What remains to be seen is if it leads to more desireable set of equilibria that are easier to learn, more robust to peturbation and other desiderata that enhance a signaling system into a language.


### Abstract

> The  emergence  of  language  was  a  defining moment  in  the  evolution  of  modern  humans.  It  was  an innovation  that  changed  radically  the  character  of  human society. Here, we provide an approach to language evolution based  on  evolutionary  game  theory.  We  explore  the  ways  in which proto-languages can evolve in a nonlinguistic society and how  specific  signals  can  become  associated  with  specific objects.  [We  assume  that  early  in  the  evolution  of  language,errors  in  signaling  and  perception  would  be  common.  We model the probability of misunderstanding a signal and show that this limits the number of objects that can be described bya  protolanguage.  This  "error  limit"  is  not  overcome  by employing more sounds but by combining a small set of more easily distinguishable sounds into words]{.mark}. The process of "word formation"  enables  a  language  to  encode  an  essentially  un-limited number of objects. Next, we analyze how words can be combined  into  sentences  and  specify  the  conditions  for  the evolution  of  very  simple  grammatical  rules.  We  argue  that grammar originated as a simplified rule system that evolved by  natural  selection  to  reduce  mistakes  in  communication.Our theory provides a systematic approach for thinking about the origin and evolution of human language.
