    abstract = "{We present a simple and effective scheme for dependency parsing which is based on
                    bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM
                    vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are
                    constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly
                    with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for
                    parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a
                    greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based
                    parser. The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or
                    surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.}",
