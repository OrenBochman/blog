## TL;DR

The paper [@kiperwasser2016simple] titled "Simple and accurate dependency parsing using bidirectional LSTM feature representations" by Eliyahu Kiperwasser ^[![](gs.svg){.bi}

](https://www.elki.cc/){.icon-link}^ and Yoav Goldberg ^[![](gs.svg){.bi} 
](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0rskDKgAAAAJ){.icon-link}^ on dependency parsing has been cited over 790 times since its publication in 2016. 

This paper provides lots pf details making it a candidate for implementation including thier choice of hyperparameters. Generally papers by Goldberg & co. are both pedagogical and concise and this paper is no exception.


## Abstract

> We present a simple and effective scheme for **dependency parsing** which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.
