- Introduction
  - Describes how cooperation among unrelated individuals has generally been explained by some form of conditional reciprocity, but notes an increased interest in alternative mechanisms such as multi-level selection and mutualism.
  - Introduces a game-theoretic model of the evolution of cooperation based on costly signaling theory.
  - Notes the model applies to a range of social interactions including food sharing, group raiding/defense, and punishing free-riding.
  - Highlights how the model is distinctive in applying to group rather than dyadic interactions and in determining endogenously the fraction of the group that signals high quality in equilibrium.
- A Model of Costly Signaling
  - Presents a game in which group members can signal their quality by providing a benefit to the group.
  - Describes the conditions for an honest signaling equilibrium where high quality types signal and low quality types do not.
  - Discusses how the equilibrium conditions depend upon the frequency of high quality types in the group.
- Dynamics
  - Introduces a replicator dynamic to model how the fraction of honest signalers and partners who respond to the signal changes over time.
  - Describes how the replicator equations demonstrate that the honest signaling equilibrium is stable and how adding plausible assumptions increases the basin of attraction of the signaling equilibrium.
- Why Signal by Providing Benefits to Others?
  - Notes how, in the model, the existence of a costly signaling equilibrium does not depend on the character of the benefit provided to the group.
  - Highlights three reasons why prosocial signaling may be favored:
    - Prosocial traits may enhance the signalerâ€™s value to a potential ally.
    - Prosocial signaling may increase broadcast efficiency.
    - Groups with a high level of prosocial costly signaling may have more fit members.
- The Evolution of Signaling
  - Describes two ways in which signaling could proliferate:
    - Stochastic events.
    - Periodic changes in the environment.
  - Discusses how intergroup competition may contribute to the evolutionary success of signaling.
  - Presents a dynamic model to explain how the frequency of high-quality types in the population can be maintained despite their higher fitness in the signaling equilibrium.
- Conclusion
  - Summarizes how the model shows that a class of signals that contribute to group benefits may proliferate in a population and be evolutionarily stable.
  - Notes how costly signaling may provide a mechanism for the evolution of cooperative and other group beneficial practices independent of other mechanisms.
  - Mentions other factors such as repeated interactions, positive assortment, and multilevel selection may reinforce this evolutionary process.
